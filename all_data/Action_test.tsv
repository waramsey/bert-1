8	1	a	Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP. And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always, GL &amp; HF &lt;3

26	1	a	Probably the best FPS shooter ever made. Nothing can beat Counter-Strike 1.6.
28	1	a	  Update to my review with some shameless advertising 05/10/2016:   Hey readers. I am now hosting a server on CS 1.6 where you can play and enjoy the fun experiences I did back in the day.   Map rotations vary from Vehicle, Aim, Surf, Knife, Defusal, and Hostage maps! IP Address: 173.199.73.78:27025     Review 21/10/2014:   I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10  Leet crew 5 lyf  Kicks csgo's â™¥â™¥â™¥ by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.  P.S - CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!  Oh yeah, you don't have to pay to use sprays in this game either.
30	1	a	Still better than Call of Duty!
32	1	a	haven't played much, but looks ok.
34	1	a	 After 14 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world .   While earning tons of money based on Counter-Strike sales, Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesn't even exist. Even more, starting with February 2013, Valve has released a couple of minor updates for Counter-Strike which intentionally created problems for the game(suddenly stopping afterwards) so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CS:GO(which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection - problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004).  Congratulations, Valve .    Counting the players that migrated to or play the non-Steam version of Counter-Strike, the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world .

40	1	a	'Lock and Load.' 'Go go go!' 'Fire in the hole!' 'The bomb has been planted.' 'Counter-terrorists/terrorists Win.'  It is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercafÃ©s across the world. For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesnâ€™t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike.   Originally a modification (mod in short) made for Valveâ€™s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a â€œprofessional onlyâ€ game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.  Getting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Donâ€™t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Donâ€™t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.  As time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Throughout the years, Counter-Strike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with Half-Life and (maybe) Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike has not only helped Valve to thrive as a gaming company, but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.
42	1	a	It's a nice game...
44	1	a	Nice oldschool game! Counter-Strike is very cool game, but now we can play the CS series of games like CS:Source and CS:GO... I can't say which game is better, it's your choice. But i can't forget this game like my childhood, thanks to VaLVE for it!
46	1	a	With only ~4000 hours of playtime (plus a few thousand prior to Steam), i might not be worthy of reviewing this game.  So i'll just leave it at: recommended.
48	1	a	This game is like an infection, you can't uninstall it.
50	1	a	enjoyed the game for only a few minutes...
52	1	a	-No lag -No russian guy saying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ -Classic -No expensive skin -No need to rank up -Cheap -lot of great server  Rip-No porn spray ;(
54	1	a	Steam Awards Nomination 2016 (review for the badge)   When I saw the The â€œJust 5 More Minutesâ€ award category :: instant flashback &amp; cold sweat..   Year; 2005, clock; around 7 pm. Tomorrow is school day and I'm at a local Internet Cafe playing with some friends ::  Counter Strike 1.6  :: time flies, u know how, its CS. Cell phone rings; constantly. 'Yes, I'm coming home, just need to finish the match, 5 minutes top'. I'm losing .. big time. I skipped some calls later (big mistake) for the sake of the match. Long story short, I was late and there were consequences. Left in hurry after and didn't pay the net fee, not that day at least. Time; 1+ am, game-over.
56	1	a	It's a real legend .. legend of PC games
58	1	a	First starting off as a cute, little mod based on the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine, Counter-Strike's legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over. Initially developed and released on top of a Half-Life modification, with the inspiration from the developer's strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism, the mod's success was immediately a marvel to behold; selling over 25 million units as a whole in the Counter-Strike franchise.  The maps and various scenarios set around the globe, players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams, counter-terrorists and terrorists. Both with a task, depending differently on the mission. Bomb scenarios, the terrorist team must plant a bomb, in a secured bomb location, while the counter-terrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb, if it may have been planted. Hostage scenarios is where the counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists. With both these modes, it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels.  The player, depending on what team they have been assigned to, can change their class into eight different character models, as well as buying weaponry and equipment, such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team. As the round is about to begin, you're left in ''Freeze time'' that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before. This of course, gives players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents.   This game is also highly customizable on the player's end.The game gives the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins, spray graphics, sprites, sound effects and HUDS that can be used in-game. I forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes Counter-Strike such a versatile game to begin with.  I don't have much to complain about this game, other than it's become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters, since its release. Aimbots, that auto-target other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed. Wallhacks, that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them, while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspective. To me, the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall.   There's a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and old-school. Old-school is for nostalgic value, something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories you've experienced and this is what the first title of Counter-Strike engulfs. Outdated, being something you don't particularly want to go back to, while there is the famous remake, Counter-Strike: Source, that runs on the more powerful and overly-recycled Source engine, allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities. Nevertheless, if you're looking for original flare that is burning in the Counter-Strike series, this game is definitely for you.  And to think, all of this success for the Counter-Strike series began as small little mod. Proof on how something so little, can create something so big. Recommended.
60	1	a	I'm sorry to say for other games, but with counter-strike 1.6 i had best gaming experience in my life.
62	1	a	best sequal to pokemon since skyrim
64	1	a	The game that started it all. I love Global Offensive but i always return to 1.6 because of the hardcore, old-school feeling.  I don't even know why i'm recommending this because obviously you all have it... Right?
66	1	a	Played 60 fps with a 20 dollars laptop. top kek mate
68	1	a	Old but gold. I really can recommend it to new CS GO players at there rise!
70	1	a	This game is legendary. This started back in 1999 and haven't got lost the pleasure of playing it. The graphics are not the best, it's an old game, but it's FUN! That was the point of the game! It's one of the best first person shooter in the world, it's not me saying that, all over the world people consider Counter Strike 1.6 one of the best shooter games. And it had lans and big event until CS:GO showed up in 2012. It's still played by LOTS of people. 17 years old and still rocks!!
72	1	a	  This is a great game with a great community. I even own the original disk  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=772601842  
74	1	a	so old! still a better story then twilight.
76	1	a	Almost screw up my exams at high school (1999/2000), when I was doing my vocational training (2001-2003) and at university (2004-2009) due to playing way too much cs...  Great game, would risk my future again! 10/10
78	1	a	'Playing Since 2006 (non-steam/steam) more that 3k hours' others : after all this time ? me : always.
80	1	a	Oldshool classic. Totally worth of buying it!
82	1	a	I want to you add achivements for CS 1.6 because game is legendary!
84	1	a	Best fps of all time
86	1	a	I still suck at CS:GO
88	1	a	Best game thank you valve
90	1	a	In this game you can play many many modes and its the most positive thing. Its not only about shooting or about playing tactic games. You can just 'chillout' on some kinds of servers and thats what I always loved in CS 1.6.
92	1	a	In the days of my youth I was told what it means to be the game And now I've reached that age I try to do all those things without a shame No matter how I try I find my way to the same old jam  Good times, bad times You know there was a game When a woman left home for a brown-eyed man But I still play and not seem to care  Sixteen, I fell in love with a game as sweet as could be It only took a couple of years till I was rid of it I swore that I won't play again and I did not come back But when that CS:GO came out I knew it will be sad  Good times, bad imes You know graphs' not at 1st place When a 'smurf' plays against silver ranked men Bring me back to those happy days  Hitbox was good and people were kind now it's not the same Those amazing rounds deep on my mind and all the pros into hall of fame If you talk about cybersport so that game was of that type Now just money flows like a river and everyone's getting hyped  Good times, bad times You know what do I mean When people were saying - go 1 on 1? And you knew it will be fun   9.3    Nearly the best online game in the world.  Don't start playing GO if you haven't played that... who am I talking to, you never played you never will.
94	1	a	Childhood
96	1	a	moms credit card is not maxed out  10/10
98	1	a	Simply THE best shooter that you can play, to forget the anger that built up inside of you after playing too much CS:GO. It truely is a relief to play another shooter than CS:GO, without messing with your aim, movement, etc.  Just set everything up the way it is in CS:GO (sensitivity, key-binds, etc.) and escape from the austerity pressure to perform well in CS:GO. And RELAX theres nothing you can do wrong here. Even when there's a cheater, just don't give a f. I mean, there isn't even a stats-record. Like there's only a serversided stats-tracking if at all. So without specifically searching for your stats on a specific server that has some kind of player-stats on it, nobody will ever know how bad you are/were :)
100	1	a	1.6 = my midle school years...my best years ever...1.6 full of life full of memories 1.6 = &lt;3
102	1	a	I have 800 hours of gameplay on this (since I got steam!). I played it for 6 years before then. Its wonderful. The best game I have ever played.
104	1	a	Counter Strike is the best shooting game, i've ever played. The 'real cs', where you plant bombs etc. is not 10/10 gaming, but look at all those great mods! The greatest thing in cs is playing mod servers, and you do not need to download them from your web, you just simply double click that server, and that's it! At first I recommend to play normal cs, if it gets boring try other servers. Oh and original maps aren't that great, except de_dust2. You must try cs even if you think it has low graphics. Gameplay is much more important than graphics, remember that!
106	1	a	A still alive first-person shooter, since 2000. The game that changed everything, along with Half-Life. Still, the best first-person for thousands. And you know why? Because this game's focus isn't on graphics. It's for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments.  All proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play Counter-Strike, doesn't matter if it is 1.6, Source or Global Offensive.   Highly recommend this game.
108	1	a	it's a good game butu must to make strong vac ban bcz cheaters those days a lot in 1 .6 they make game suck :\ u must control this game bcz it's international game and a lot of people love it  and thx for read my review
110	1	a	Best Game All-Time c: #Oldschool 2000 ^^
112	1	a	Arguably the best competitive fps so far, the skill ceiling is very high; however getting started is easy.
114	1	a	One of the most favourite game of my childhood I have spent so much time playing it and I loved it.  From a little cute Half-Life mod to this... When Counter-Strike was first released it gained it's popularity immediately and become number 1 online action game, one of the most successful competitive games ever created which was easy to learn but hard to master, now Counter-Strike is dead or at least for someone because it's pro scene died in 2012, yes the pro scene is dead but the game itself is still alive, after so many years people still play and love this game, even it's pro scene lasted for unreal time, imagine it started in 2000 year and lasted for 12 years how cannot this be legendary, it's when graphics doesn't matter only gameplay.  I strongly recommend to play this game at least once if you have ever played it and enjoyed, it might not be as fun as before but I still recommend, if you like original games or havent played CS at all and started from CS:S, CS:GO doesn't matter... You should really give it a try.
116	1	a	i have been playing this game since dial up and absolutely love it addicted. never know what some one is gonna do. fy is deatchmatch de is bomb map cs maps are hostage many mods and plugins that keep the game exciting and new along w new custom maps being made frequently
118	1	a	I miss the good ole GldSrc engine
120	1	a	Played it over 2000hours..woah.. all i can say is..this...is old but gold.. Couldn't let go of 1.6 even after csgo came out.Cs is just so much fun!
122	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6  The only game that lets you have a 5 kill streak and a defuse with 300+ ping  11/10- Would lag again.  Also, a surprisingly successful dating program. Watch the chat when a girl gamer joins the server and see how many players hit on her. Counter Strike is truly the definition of 'international love'.
124	1	a	Score says it all. There's another version out called Counter-Strike: Source, but it's nothing compared to how the original Counter-Strike is. Plus, now adays it's really really cheap, like 10 dollars off of steam. As well, it has like the biggest competitive gaming community in the world, with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of tournaments and players etc... good stuff.
126	1	a	NOSTALGIA  classic footstep sounds classic knife default weapons no 'Russians' no troll not p2w [ same all cs games - (but nexon zombies is p2w) everything is O.K. + 11/10 Best game ever. -
128	1	a	Gaming History!
130	1	a	Quake was the first game I was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time. Counter-Strike was the second - and easily more addicting. There's a reason that I still compare every multi-player shooter experience back to original Counter-Strike, to this day. There's a reason I still compare every server community to this (Counter-Strike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day, compared to these days, where a server is just something you're automatically dumped into and feels like every other server).  Despite many iterations, nothing quite plays like the original. It's not hard to see why there are still 10,000 to 60,000 people playing this  at any one time on any day , fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of Steam.  This is where it all started. Without this, there's an entire genre of shooter and multi-player that just vanishes. The original days of Counter-Strike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life. It's unlikely that will ever be trumped.
132	1	a	Dont buy this game it's too much fun
134	1	a	How to end your life  Step 1 - Download this game  done .
136	1	a	Best CS of all time!!!
138	1	a	Nice game, my first time PC games.  9/10
140	1	a	10/10 Still the best game ever.
142	1	a	Best Game Ever xD But I Cant Play It On My MAC :/
144	1	a	Game is really good. I like it because of the genre of the game.  I will do some pros and cons for the game  PROS -This game is really old (15 years now), and people still buy it and play it -The game has over 3500 dedicated servers -The community is really big for the game this old -There are really good welcoming server admins -The game has good graphics even for the 15 year old game -It's fun to play  CONS -Some server admins are kicking people because of their high Latency -You have to have really good connection to the internet to play the game as it is meant to be played  I recommed it. I rate it 8/10, would Flashbang my teammate again!!
146	1	a	&gt;join german server &gt;shout S13G HEIL &gt;20 german people shout at once &gt;'You have been permanently banned from ther server'     10/10 would s13g h31L again  fact: I'm literally banned from every German server in the server list because i shouted h3il hitler or gas the jews too much
148	1	a	The game may be old now but it is still a great game and full of fun custom maps. It's a good way to spend time with frineds and/or family with low hardware requirments and cheaper pricing. The game may be modded to improve your expierence as well which is allows for more customized game play that never gets old.
150	1	a	Harder than CSGO
152	1	a	Everyone Gets Grenades Fire In The Hole Fire In The Hole Fire In The Hole Fire In The Hole Fire In The Hole Fire In The Hole Fire In The Hole Fire In The Hole Until Everyone Died the end
154	1	a	3 Words about this game:  OLD, BUT GOLD.
156	1	a	Game of my childhood.  It was the year 1998, i-ve been having my Pentium3 PC for a few months (just upgraded from a 486 DX2 with windows 3.1) and my cousing comes along and shows me the new game he got...  I ended up playing it for a whole year... over and over again.  And then came along Counter-Strike 1.1 in 2000... and then the other mods from Half-Life.  Thank you for my beautifull childhood
158	1	a	 Counter strike is one of the first-played video games when I had a PC 9 years ago.  I had an illegal version installed from a third party website, yes I never heard Steam before. And sitting there, playing against bots almost over the night.  Display - A CRT monitor about 15.6 inches. Processor - Pentium Celeron singel core processor with 2.3 GHz. Graphics - nVidia Geforce 4 MX440  Memory - 256 MB with uknown specs anymore. Up to 80 GB hard disk storage that's all I got.  Later on more games came to me running on this PC for more than 2 years before I got a new one. Wolfstein, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, Half Life, Voice City and something like these. 
160	1	a	Now i know what you guys are probably going to say: 'OMG this game sucks the graphics are bad D:' and like 'Pfff this game is old nobody still plays it. well it's not, its a game that's made like 13 years ago so don't expect frosbite engine graphics etc... instead you get the way more epic pixel-ish graphics and really classic sounds, and this game is still active with about 30k to 40k players each day.(That's more then all cod games together) And in my opinion it's a must have game since it's one of the best games ever and you still can install skins etc and it's price is good it's only 10 euro or dollars for this great game.
162	1	a	A heart-pounding, visceral experience that gets under your skin. The 'just one more round' addiction factor is very high. When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a well-oiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing.Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and enjoy. Sure-fire fun for the online enthusiast.
164	1	a	  i love this game :)
166	1	a	The best FPS game of all time hands down ! I have been playing this game from the early betas right from the begining ! (I still remember to this day, the character's legs weren't moving, it was on cs_siege) This was back in late 1999 or early 2000, now its allmost 2017 and I am still playing ! That is 17 years. This game has stood the test of time. Modern games are spurring like mushrooms with advanced graphics and whatnot, but none of them can give you the experience that this game can give you. I can sincerely say that there are a total of 2 maybe 3 games in all gaming history that can match this game's gaming experience. All in all I recommend this game to any new players who may come across it, who are looking for an amazing online multiplayer experience, and also a big shoutout for the old-school player as myself, don't stop playing this gem ! I sincerelly fear that it will take a very long time until a masterpiece of a game like this will appear, maybe even never. But who knows ? Untill then start cs 1.6 gl and hf ! :)
168	1	a	The best CS version! Old school :-D
170	1	a	My old game :) , Good Game ever
172	1	a	My first game on steam, and after all these years since 2004, CS is still my favorite game. It's interesting, fun and nice FPS game!  10/10
174	1	a	if only the servers were active in australia, good game either way.
176	1	a	.    
178	1	a	Where it all started :) A true classic to the Counter-Strike Series that will never get old.
180	1	a	better than cs:go: - you have spray feature (removed in cs:go) - you have flashlight &amp; nightvision (removed in cs:go) - you have dark maps and/or dark places on a map (removed in cs:go, dark places are pretty bright, this is why there is no more flashlight &amp; nightvision, it destroys the immersion, dark places &amp; dark maps are useful for many aspects ingame (hiding or warcraft server when cloaked or when you want someone to knife) and reminds me of 2002 game bf1942 where dark maps are not really dark lol. VALVE shame on you) - You have character selection (removed in cs:go) - you have no ranking &amp; market feature (added in cs:go, everyone plays cs:go because they think they end up as a rich-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, also on every server there is trade spam in chat and even you get friendrequest spam from traders, also community is not looking at your skill anymore, but at your rank and not every server + singleplayer against bots has rank enabled.)  - You have no CoD clone like CS:GO  Unlike CS:GO, everyone plays this for fun, not for useless skins, money, rank etc.. also, here you cant waste 600$ for a skin. You can get even new models (which does not only change your weapon texture, but the model) from gamebanana for FREE! You can make your M4 look like the G36C etc.  10/10 my fav childhood game
182	1	a	I ll never forget these days and months, I spent to throw grenades on de_dust 2x2, kill zombies with machinegun and run for my life, with my cracked version of cs 1.6.  Goodnight, sweet prince 
184	1	a	The most legendary competitive fps game you could imagine. Same old graphics but still keeps you playing.
186	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.  Personal Rating: 10/10.
188	1	a	better than CS:GO this game make guns feel more realistic than new generation games
190	1	a	It's a classical game for everyone to enjoy. It always takes me back to Counter-Strike 1.6 when I need to remember how to play 1st person shooters :)
192	1	a	+ AAA game, 50% skillz and 50% strategy. + Easy to play but hard to master. + Playing it since 2002 + 1000+ hours invested only in steam (since 2011). + 10+ smashed keyboards. + Best rage-quit simulator! + The game that apparently my mom plays in secret since every player knows her. + Achievement unlock: Learn to verbally abuse people in Russian, Spanish and Portuguese. + The reason why the steam platform came into existence. + The grandfather of tactical FPS.  1.6/1.6 I would smash my keyboard again!
194	1	a	good game and more cheaters
196	1	a	Amazing game, full of good and old memories, 17 year old game and still alive &lt;3 Hope these old 1.6 days can be back... :) #StillPlayinIt
198	1	a	You can do thingies and shoot heads!
200	1	a	 Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. 
202	1	a	I've been playing this game for 10 years (7 or 8 years on non-steam), and it still amazes me with the fact that people are still playing this game.   Met bunch of amazing people, learned english more than what school has taught me, joined and left great community every now and then; this game has a huge impact on my life, from personality to the way I see the world (not exaggerating).  Some people claimed they have slept with my family, some claimed they are not a hacker (while their crosshair moves furiously, claiming it was an earthquake), some other claimed they can play better if their ping was lower and some other claimed they have tracked my IP and are on the way to kill me. What a super friendly community.  Best multiplayer fps game in the history of mankind, never gets me bored with tons of user-made mod, and one thing that this game never cease to amaze me is the fact that this game has a better hitbox than CS:GO (come at me CS:GO plebs)  1.6/Counter-Strike, would get rekt by a player playing in the earthquake again
204	1	a	For the past 16 years this wonderful educational game has taught children other languages,that many foreign men have had sex with their mother, and fire in the hole. I wonder why I get in trouble when I stand up during English and yell 'Fire in The Hole!' and lob random â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at people. I was in Spanish one day and I was startled as I was daydreaming of CS and I told the teacher I slept with her mother in Spanish. Turns out she's dead. This is the game that coined the term 'I am autistic and want to kill myself'. 10/10 would fire in the hole again.
206	1	a	Thank you, Valve, for our happy childhood! 
208	1	a	Its ok
210	1	a	A classic, sometimes still massively played in eerie internet cafÃ©s in some countries.
212	1	a	CONNECT 91.211.116.28:27015
214	1	a	literally the best multiplayer fps game in existence
216	1	a	:)
218	1	a	Better than CoD. 10/10
220	1	a	it's good game when you play with you friends in multyplayer mod, but i do not recommend this game for offline mod  This is some good settings to paly better    Choose The high resolution on options     Get High fps by typing this cmds on console :      fps_max 333    fps_modem 333    developer 1 Counter-strike (CS) it's great game for low pc(s)  
222	1	a	IT'S THE BEST MULTIPLAYER GAME EVER!!!  10/10  
224	1	a	Play this game for skill no need buy anything  No pay to win Use strategy and real game fps with recoil You have to understand and practice to make  Your self pro
226	1	a	Once in the 6 years I met this wonderful game, still remember playing with a friend :)   It was fun. The game is 10/10
228	1	a	  #thebest
230	1	a	STEAM IJUEPUTAS DEJAME JUGAR CS
232	1	a	Counter Strike, A game which changed the era of First person shooting game since it was born made in 1999 beta version Released on 2000 'The Game' Released on 2002 *I think*   I personally think counterstrike or CS made steam what it is thou Dota 2 and several others are there. This game has been ranked Number# 1 Since 2000 In front of my eyes. Ranked 1 by several industries and one of the most online server recording having more servers than any other game, Game  tracker.com  not rs.
234	1	a	The mother of all FPS games! Although some may argue that this is a outdated game, I still love it. You get that awesome freedom of movement which you cannot get on CS:S (as much) and on CS:GO. In addition, this game nearly runs on all pc's even potato's with wires. It has a large modding team behind it (AMXX), which isn't affiliated with Valve but nevertheless it makes the game 100x better, and adds amazing mods to it.
236	1	a	Even though the new CS is out the old never gets old.
238	1	a	One of best FPS games ever, it's about 14 yrs old, but still getting updates. Thanks valve.
240	1	a	Pew pew since 2000, still works!
242	1	a	i love this im old player
244	1	a	They copied the AK and other things from CoD 4. Bad game
246	1	a	this paradise game
248	1	a	Old Good FPS.
250	1	a	Its alot of fun.
252	1	a	Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of 'shooter', which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.  And here is my thoughs...  This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007. I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER/MIX/PCW/CM/AUTOMIX/BRUSH/ARUSH and more and more and more... It's just fantastic! :D  10/10 Would recommand it!
254	1	a	Old but Gold.
256	1	a	Greatest game ever.
258	1	a	Well only a line: its a life time addiction.
260	1	a	One of the best classic multiplayer games ever!  Best gameplay in multiplayer games i've seen.  Most People, who play CS:GO never played CS 1.6, which is kinda sad.. Not a single CS Game can replace 1.6.  Btw. Most E-sport tournaments were held in cs 1.6.  So since CS:GO came out, CS 1.6 kinda lost advantage. (Mostly cause of the years it already has.)  We will miss you 1.6 &lt;3 Thank you for all the love and fun you gave us .. :(  R.I.P.  Remembrance of Counter-Strike 1.6:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrUMZZiheLU 
262	1	a	so old! still a better story then twilight.
264	1	a	as
266	1	a	The best game
268	1	a	this game is awsume ,Graphics dose'nt matter for a GamER ;)
270	1	a	Still better than CSGO, CS is rule, is free modable, it mean you can play online even ou modded it. CSGO cannot play online if modded, except map
272	1	a	very good good game play all &lt;3
274	1	a	?????????
276	1	a	Old times ^^  This game have a lot of cheaters, but it's still good old clasic.. Old but gold! :)
278	1	a	So the dudes who really play Multi player games, a note to every Indian regardless whether it is a parent or a gamer.  http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=135&amp;userid=487400&amp;blogid=8331&amp;profile=1#r5441265  Go through my blog. and you will have a change of mind .. I bet P.S : Its long but worth the time spending :)
280	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6 remains an old school game. Is game of our childhood. No updates, no new things, still remain our passion.
282	1	a	Basically this game was released back in the year 2000 and still is one of the most played games on Steam.  So clearly it must be good because so many are still playing it. I definitely recommend this game and if you don't like to shoot terrorist or counter terrorists you can always try different game modes like zombie modes.  10/10
284	1	a	Happy 15th Birthday to the best FPS
286	1	a	Motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t game

300	1	a	Highly recomended it is very good game it is a game that takes you to our child hood actually servers are very good buy this game
302	1	a	i like the gems cs1.6
304	1	a	WHEN YOU'RE A COUNTER TERRORIST YOU SHOOT THOSE BAD TERRORIST AND STOP THEM FROM PLANTING EVIL BOMBS IN AMERICA,
306	1	a	The most classic and best online tactic shooter ever! Cheap, great and addicting :-) Unfortunately there are not many players left, since CS GO was released. And the big amount of cheaters is another problem to deal with.
308	1	a	dis is da real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, better than grape juice!
310	1	a	A classical! Definetly I recommend!
312	1	a	beasstt
314	1	a	This game is my life &lt;3
316	1	a	The biggest game changer of all time in the online FPS genre. Respect it.
318	1	a	I've been playing this game since 2004, this game is mind blowing awesome. If you're not looking deeply into graphics, but just want to have fun playing, then this game is for you. Multiple gamemodes, will keep anyone amused. If you don't have it, then what are you waiting for? Get it now!
320	1	a	Old but gold!:) I like it.
322	1	a	One of the classics of the shooting genre and precursor to most of today's modern shooters, for all the good and the bad that may imply. Counter-Strike 1.6 is the second iteration of the original Half-Life mod and, quite likely, its most popular incarnation. The rather simplistic gameplay coupled with accessible system requirements and intuitive controls make it one of the most long-lived shooters today, still sporting a massive fanbase.  A game that must be tried at least once by any shooting game neophyte.
324	1	a	Great FPS game, recommended! 
326	1	a	i forgat tha wold whan i palay et.
328	1	a	Still the best game ever made ... I don't think anybody can beat this engine ...
330	1	a	1,694 hours on CS 1.6.. No regrets.
332	1	a	Awesome Game Just Loved It....&lt;3
334	1	a	Great game, classic to play with your friends :D
336	1	a	Great game

346	1	a	Great game!  I've had lots of fun with this game. Graphics are outdated but community is still here to support it.
348	1	a	Just like the old good times  
350	1	a	&gt;'Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game.' &gt;'incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare' &gt;'incredibly realistic' Tell that to the people bhopping and surfing across the map at 300 miles an hour. I love this game

368	1	a	good game   visit my gorup and play on my cs server   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/yuugaming 
370	1	a	;]
372	1	a	This game is probably the best game ever. Even it is old, it is still the best shooter game.
374	1	a	Counter-Strike became a 16 yr old game so hbd.
376	1	a	Best shooter.
378	1	a	FANTASTIQUE!
380	1	a	the best :)
382	1	a	It's simple. Terrorist x CTs Few minutes to complete objectives. The more you play, the better you get. I used to be professional but now I suck at this,  And I dont think i can play as I used to, but it still worth playing this game. Counter Strike is about competition. I'll always like to shoot at my friends' faces.  Counter-Strike is the best game-mod(-game) ever.  Valve wins.
384	1	a	It's Counter-Strike you point gun and shoot terrorists (or counter-terrorists if you prefer the ak)  Just don't cross the streams
386	1	a	Good old 1.6 was and will always be the greatest counterstrike!
388	1	a	This Game Is Legend  There is no need of comment
390	1	a	Nice game.
392	1	a	it's great game
394	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldnâ€™t find the stupid cake.
396	1	a	cool 
398	1	a	10/10
400	1	a	Great Game!! Nice Graphics!! Online ServerÂ´s are good... Sometimes Non-steam Cheaters appears but if the server has admin, should be fine... Nice Game For People Who Got Low Graphics In The Computer
402	1	a	this game is old i still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on kids
404	1	a	is the best game in the world have fun ;)
406	1	a	i felt so bad that i heved the game pirated :(
408	1	a	This game is just legendary, 16 years old and still one of the most played games.
410	1	a	Bought this masterpiece in a TESCO. 10/10
412	1	a	The best shooter that was ever released
414	1	a	Full of haxors x]
416	1	a	The game that formed a generation. 2015 and still awsome.
418	1	a	If you search a good game which need skills and tactics this game is for you . Brilliant game I`m playing it from 2003 and still playin' because this game is really really good !!!
420	1	a	Classic FPS.
422	1	a	Played 3k+ hours, pretty bad game wouldn't recommend to others Kappa.
424	1	a	Old school badass timekiller,more than 3k hours of fun,rage,conversations and so on. 'Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you'
426	1	a	:)
428	1	a	The classic CS game, can't get better than this. 10/10
430	1	a	This game is good.Really Good!!
432	1	a	One of my first video games that I started to play. One of my favorite &lt;3 :D
434	1	a	CS:GO is good. CS is great.  I keep on playing, and school I will be late.
436	1	a	Recommended. Here is the pros/cons of this game in my humble opinion:    PROS
438	1	a	:$
440	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!
442	1	a	Its a good game :D
444	1	a	Well, here it is. Some call it 'the mother of shooters', some call it 'bullsh*t'. Well, I canÂ´t tell, whether you will like it, but the fact is, that it started one of the first big shooter franchises ever.   Pros:  -awesome gameplay -awesome gunplay -nostalgia -teambased -mechanics   Cons:  -a bit outdated though   I myself like the classic Counter Strike, but I think there should be big Skillbased MatchMaking Sites like FaceIt or ESEA (if possible even free ones), because the Competetive Mode from Global Offensive is pretty good (even though sometimes it sucks with its rank system).  I think, that it is a great game, but perhaps some players will be put off by the old graphics, but these are pretty good, if you imagine, that this game is about 16 years old.    Must Have for a shooter fan or anyone else who loves 'old' games  9.8/10
446	1	a	;)
448	1	a	Such game Much love Many sweat
450	1	a	the best game for ever
452	1	a	it's awesome!!!
454	1	a	Standard run and gun game that says it tries to stop cheaters and hackers out of the game, instead all it does is ban people who are having internet trouble trying to blame them for lag switching. It does not hitting those who you can obviously watch and see they are using aim bots by spectating after death and always aiming at people through walls at their heads ready to shoot the moment they turn corners.
456	1	a	Perfect game to play at school :D
458	1	a	So I just played the original Counter Strike, CS1.6 for about an hour and after over 100 hours of both CSS and CSGO, this game is AMAZING! But so different! I love this game and its game series! It taught me tactical gameplay and how much communication is key but this game lacks a bit of that but not much. I absolutely love this and highly recommend it!
460	1	a	Amazing game . Totaly adictive and loads of fun . Have been playing from quite long now. Never did i get bored of playing counter strike 1.6. :)
462	1	a	Absolutely outstanding game. beautifuly made and an absolute masterpeice to say none the least. If you don't have a good PC or want the old cs retro feel. Pick this up and enjoy yourself with some mates. Awesome game.
464	1	a	Everyone knows what this game is, i just wanna say it`s a big part of my childhood, like GTA VC. How can`t u love it?
466	1	a	The best game that I've played for last 10 years, however cs go took my heart forever. Buy this game if you wish to come back to old days sitting in large screens and playing cs 1.6 all day. :)
468	1	a	Look son, a legend. (y)
470	1	a	Few years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS - team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS: GO. It seems that now it is not so! If you pay attention to the broadcast with IEM 6 WC, we see that CS 1.6 By Views prevzashla SC 2, not only is this game broke all past their records. So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the 'Feedback', the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result. As for the keys to the CS: GO, something I'm working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys! I will write how I succeed!
472	1	a	This is the BEST FPS ever, Counter-Strike was the game, which made Esports evolve big time and is the reason for alot of great games today. Without Counter-Strike, i guess alot of good games wouldn't exist today.
474	1	a	take a chance with the dice mate
476	1	a	Good times ... :(
478	1	a	Wery cool games :p
480	1	a	Classic.

502	1	a	It's a classic!
504	1	a	The best Action game beginning of the 21th century
506	1	a	I can't stop playing CS 1.6.This is the game of our childhood , a game which would never die even there is CS:GO !
508	1	a	Very balanced game. Should have Steam Trading Cards and Achievements.
510	1	a	Seriously, one of my favorite games of all time.
512	1	a	Such a perfect game,
514	1	a	+1
516	1	a	I think that low graphics but old but gold game.. ALL DOWNLOAD IT!!
518	1	a	^^
520	1	a	Old is Gold
522	1	a	IF YOU LOVE WALKING ON INVISIBLE BLOCKS, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.
524	1	a	Old schooll
526	1	a	This game STILL continue to live on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CS:Source isn't that much like by the pros since 2004 as CS:S as quoted: 'Too easy' and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for CS:GO, but still, because of it's core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it.  Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since.  It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you don't have GNU/Linux (In which I have), then you can buy Counter Strike : Globle Offensive anyway, since it is newer and (I think) has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well.  Verdict: 9.5/10 - It still holds it place.
528	1	a	awsome game
530	1	a	:)
532	1	a	I don't think there is much to say about this game since it has been said already. I enjoy playing it even though I suck at it. A lot. It's much harder than CS:GO for me but it has proven one thing: a game with bad graphics can still be good in 2016 ;) I apologise for my English.
534	1	a	I Love This Game :*
536	1	a	I love this â™¥

554	1	a	the best multiplayer game of all time in my opinion
556	1	a	Best way to waste your fkin time! Love it!
558	1	a	This is not a game I bought. This is a piece of my childhood that I paid to have back.
560	1	a	I'll remind you: I've played CS 1.6 into oblivion on another account. 101 hours is not the full representation of my gameplay in this game.   CS 1.6 is a classic game everybody almost knows what is, at least if you are an FPS player. Of course today it is very outdated and not something you would otherwise play as your main game, but it certainly is something to take a walk through every once in a while - especially as a trip down memory lane or as a fun little LAN game to take your mind off modern games, which can get tiresome after a while (at least in my honest opinion.)   I can definitely recommend this. I played it a lot, and all the while, despite my review of it, CS:CZ had an end consensus that was a better smooth gameplay somewhat, this is one of the best games of all time. At least in terms of the FPS genre. No doubt. But if you were to play it today, you'd have to be patient as the only people still playing this online are either veterans, somewhat experienced people or cheaters (on VAC-insecure servers which there also is quite a lot of.) If you're lucky, you might still find that some of the best servers that kept the community going might still be up. Maybe.   Tread carefully, but definitely try it.
562	1	a	3k hours on it. Def worth it
564	1	a	played just a little. it's ok
566	1	a	Good game if you have friends      I dont
568	1	a	It's an oldschool game but the only one I play. There is no reason for me to play some newer version of CS. I like the simplicity of 1.6 version
570	1	a	About Counter-Strike Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Gameplay Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.  Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.  Thanks Valve Thanks !!! Old but Gold !!!  10/10 From Me Sweep Playing this game since 2004

604	1	a	)
606	1	a	the most addictive online game!
608	1	a	I'm not one to criticise a game but, this has to be a great title mostly for it's 'Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role,' system even if it had many problems. The gameplay is great with plenty of user created content to play. Vanilla gameplay is not advised as it gets repetitive fast. Overall gameplay is a 8.5 out of ten. The sound isn't very good with it's annoying tracks, the only way to fix this is to download custom gun sounds but thats a pain. The sound wasn't even good in 2000 when the game came out and thats telling you something. Overall 4.0 out of a possible ten. I know this is odd for me to review a game off of this but online community. The community if few and far between, there are BARELY any good servers up and sometimes the community is awful. (still not as bad as team fortress 2 IMO XD) Overall 6.0 out of ten. Graphics usually take the backseat in my reviews but, I do have to say the graphics are OK I mean in 2000 they still weren't as good as UNREAL 1 or IDTECH 3 but they get the job done. Overall 6.5 out of ten. My verdict is that this game is good and still is I have to say this is a damn fine game earning my score as an 80% out of 100% (BTW This is all criticism because, I AM A CRITIC.) (I go into detail about every problem a game has.) Therefore I recommend. Monstercat signing out.
610	1	a	Fav game of all time. CS:GO is fun but still doesn't feel the same!

674	1	a	it's cs:D!
676	1	a	The best mod ever made. Buy GO if you like matchmaking. Active community, millions playing. Buy Source if you like online 4fun gameplay. Dead, but it has a lot of servers. Buy 1.6 if you wanna a little of the two. Dead as Source.
678	1	a	Ultimate Classic Masterpiece that will Live Forever.  RECOMMENDED 
680	1	a	THE BEST GAME ON THE WORLD !!!
682	1	a	Cool
684	1	a	Well if you think â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iy weapons,you are a very crazy person.This game yes its an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Game but its fun so no give any crap.Don't buy it on 9.99 dolars buy it on when sales like 2.49 and 4.99 dolars.Great game for relax.Recommending!
686	1	a	never get tired of playing this game..
688	1	a	 Brings back those memories!
690	1	a	I know if this game is so old, but many memories if you played untill long time  how to make friends in the game? played counter-strike in comunities keep counter-strike for your histories  thanks. 
692	1	a	This is where history was written. the son of the big daddy Half-Life. Since the game was released, even with newer versions like Source and GO, it is still very popular. Example of a masterpiece.
694	1	a	Whether you are a hardcore PC gamer, or if you have just bought your first PC, Counter-strike 1.6 should be the first game you buy.  Graphics don't matter, this game can produce hours uopn hours of entertainment.  10/10 Highly recommended.
696	1	a	There can't be better than 1.6 throughout all these years playing it since I didn't even know what's steam. Buying the original game feels way better than non-steam no lag experience as some of you say. It's hella worth the time spent it's been almost 7 years for me playing this game since I was a kid. My childhood and maybe later would be my adulthood also being spent on it. The amount of mods/servers are unbelievable! all of them are amazing as I tried them all. I can't deny that I am addicted to it but, yet! It's hella worth to re-born and be played like the past times! Tournaments and more. I can't withstand the ignorance of valve to it's amazing old games! Just remember that before cs go came out, your success was not in CS:S or CS:CZ it was all in this game. &lt;3
698	1	a	Good Old Classic.
700	1	a	I was sitting in CT Spawn in de_dust2 after I found my entire team afk sitting right next to me. I decided to sneak up on cat when I heard 'Bomb has been planted' by the terrorist opposition. I proceeded to act like a Slick Ninja by avoiding all terrorists. Only to find out most of them went to look for our team and killed them in ct spawn. I went around on Cat Walk, Threw a smoke, and went to cut the wire of the bomb the Terrorists had planted. I almost cut the Blue wire, and it could have cost us the round. 5 Seconds goes by, and it says, 'Counter Terrorist wins'.   At that very moment, I just realized I had won the game.  That is my story.  Counter-Strike = Thumbs up!
702	1	a	NICE RIOT SHIELD
704	1	a	Although I'm keeping this a thumbs up. I never liked 1.6. Cool to see how the game evloved.. but I never liked the 1.6 update from 1.5.
706	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nice shooter game.One of the first FPS games I tryed in my life.
708	1	a	I'm just here to post the 6,666th review for this game... get it.
710	1	a	cs the best if u want to have a good game . :D
712	1	a	#1 GaM3, 0n3 of my favourite GaM3s.
714	1	a	Best game ever made &lt;33333333 HBD 15 years
716	1	a	.
718	1	a	Fire in the hole!
720	1	a	My first ever game was CS 1.5 , all i can say it has immortality , because this game is so awesome and nostalgic it will never be forgotten, shame that not as much player left, but still enough to play diffrent maps and modes :)
722	1	a	 www.fastcup.net 
724	1	a	+ Competetive. Easy to play. Can Include AI for training. Tons of servers/server plugins/custom maps/even custom guns. Fun to play, always. - Little repeating.  In overall, I recommend it to everyone, please do not judge this game for graphics and/or lack of military actions, GoldSrc engine is not Real Virtuality 3 ( Arma 2 engine ), and this game is old school, typical classic so graphics are what they are.
726	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6 Will Never Die ! Valve Created Counter-Strike , and it found an amazing success , many legends appeared , Spawn , Cyx , Heaton , Walle . were legends ! NAVI , SK GAMING , Fnatic , NIP ! were legendary cs 1.6 teams ! , Spawn Was Legend â™¥ But Took retirment in : 26-02-2010 ! Cs 1.6 lost a 'Legend' , Cyx was Legend too ! but died in a car accident 29-07-2010 ! cs 1.6 lost an other legend !

728	1	a	it is the best counter strike ever
730	1	a	Oh,I remember the good times when I played CS withouth even knowing what to do but still having fun. Now we got CS:GO and CS:S and CS isnt getting so much love. If i would play CS i would not play it alone,just with a friend. Anyways gets 9/10 for making my childhood beatiful &lt;3
732	1	a	Best of all times
734	1	a	A pure masterpiece of an FPS
736	1	a	the reason i started using steam :D
738	1	a	very good game
740	1	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  5/5  Must have.
742	1	a	.
744	1	a	I used to play this game with my friends when we had to do military service; it was a lot of fun pretending that we were fighting Russians while putting to use what we would learn during training. However, it seems that the only people who play now are Turkish children who hack and have bad ping so, I would not recommend this game any more.
746	1	a	Highly recommend this game to all..:D
748	1	a	i love cs 1.6 but in this one there is no bots  
750	1	a	2400 hours in 2 years, ruined my life.
752	1	a	This is a very fun game if you can find some friends to play with. There are a lot of servers with custom content such as models or even game modes that completely change the game. Even though it's old there are still active servers with plenty of players on them. It's very easy to make a custom map if you wish to play one. Only bad thing is that the graphics and models are not that great. Also most servers are in spanish
754	1	a	Very nice 1.6 i like this game
756	1	a	Over 6k Hrs of non-steam version...And i didnt got bored.. Still one of best competetive 5v5 game ever made...   LOVE IT &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
758	1	a	Bought this game a bit too late... wish I would've been around to play it back in it's prime.  This game is simply a classic. My first Counter-Strike was Source. I loved Source a lot, and that lead to me getting CS:GO. CS:GO is now my most played game. ANYWAYS, I bought this game pretty recently and I love playing it. Too bad the servers are bugged I think, otherwise, still has an alright community. great gameplay and requires a lot of skill.  I love the wallbanging and the style you have to shoot. Not so much run n gun like the other games in the series.  I definitely recommend this game. Even though I doubt many people are still buying this game!
760	1	a	Lyf is 1 but CS is 1.6
762	1	a	Old is Gold, if you dont have a superior machine, no worries you will still enjoy the classic
764	1	a	This game, is not a multiplayer game, is THE Multiplayer Game. This game is classic, is a monster! Counter-Strike... I love those words. This is my 2 favorite game of all time. To be good in this game you must be a strategist, to have a good team relationship, and takes dedication. This game has tons of weapons to choose. THe game modes are PERFECT, the other community gamemodes are even better! You like COD with zombies, well, this game haved zombies before COD, and better zombies. In what game are you gonna do a deathrun, where you must be alert to everything and to have skills to survive and kill a terrorist? In what game are you gonna kill zombies, while they run at full speed and all your teammates throw granades and shoot as if there was no tommorow? In what game are you gonna surf on wall? In what game are you gonna find this quantity of maps, and good maps!? In what game!? Battlefield and COD can have better graphics, destruction, campaing and more guns, but, they will never have the community that Counter-Strike have.    We made Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike made us.  (English is not my first language)
766	1	a	Started playing this game when I was 8 years old ( 2002 ). Bravo Counter-Strike! 
768	1	a	The Old Famous game in 2012

806	1	a	Always good as a trip down the memory lane!
808	1	a	Back when Counter-Strike was good. Of all games in this series, the other games aren't as complete as this one. Though this game maybe feels outdated, it does pack alot of fun for anyone who is a fan of FPS games. The FPS function in this game is superb and it feels great to get headshots and so on. If you're intrested in this game and if you're fully aware of what you are getting in to, then get it!
810	1	a	1999 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some B-Day cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too.   This isn't like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No it's much more different. Counter-Strike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You don't unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops &amp; Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops don't them too.  On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down. -Zombies Survival/Escape -Soccer (Or Football for the Europeans) -Surf -Bhop/KZ (Climbing Zone) -Pokemod -Gungame (Those new may have heard such from Call of Duty's spinoff) -And more, etc.  So now that I've explained the game I guess I can lay down some pro's yet con's to playing Counter-Strike 1.6  PROS -Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities -Booming community that has been alive for 15 years -Plethora of servers to choose from -Competetive and Casual at the same time -Fun to play with a group of friends -More skill based than many other games out there -Cheap price   CONS -Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting -Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better -May seem repetitive after a while  I came into CS late. But, I'm glad this was the first one I owned.
812	1	a	Ttesports | Classic Server-93.157.46.204:27015
814	1	a	I don't have to tell you what Counter Strike is right? The Steam version is better then a pirated one since the servers work perfectly and it got most bugs out since the days of Won. net
816	1	a	One of my favourate game.... :) 
818	1	a	buy this game
820	1	a	The best CS ever made, in the history of CS. World class game. Only skill, no skins, no betting, no random spraying, no luck factors involved unlike some games *cough CS:GO cough* :D
822	1	a	I remember back in the days when I was called cyberathlete. This game was so awesome with wallhacks, playing on unofficial VAC servers hosted by Online Game Cheat community. The player with best cheat was master of time. I wish I was that guy when I had a car in Jerusalem. You know three wheels and stuff with aimbot on the roof, freaky oh yeas.
824	1	a	One of the best FPS games of all time.
826	1	a	The best game ever
828	1	a	''Fire in the hole!''  10/10
830	1	a	best shooter
832	1	a	ISIS tried to recruit me.   10/10
834	1	a	One of the best games in the world, this game has been my childhood game for years. The community is active, making this one of the oldest and active games of the 3 decades.
836	1	a	Best online gungame...no words to describe how gud it is ....i wil simply say do play it once in a life time...:)
838	1	a	Best online gungame...no words to describe how gud it is ....i wil simply say do play it once in a life time...:)
840	1	a	If you didn't know this game is the reason Steam was invented and for that reason alone I believe everyone on Steam should own this game. Edit. Nominated this game for the Test Of Time award because no game deserves it as much as Counter Strike.
842	1	a	10/10
844	1	a	300+ games and still the best game I got on Steam. Classic.
846	1	a	This should definately win an award
848	1	a	THE BEST GAME EVER.... My first ever Multiplayer FPS game that got me hooked to the genre....  Games that do this are always special...  10/10
850	1	a	This is an excellent and classic game, every FPS player should play this game.
852	1	a	700h and still playing it &lt;3
854	1	a	Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with Ð¡S: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..  
856	1	a	Old School Rules B-)
858	1	a	700h and still playing it &lt;3
860	1	a	You have it already.
862	1	a	700h and still playing it &lt;3
864	1	a	it's very good and play again and again
866	1	a	I love this Game , 20 years this game was released and still people play it .  addicted game &lt;3
868	1	a	The original CS.  This is where it all started, 1.6. While many forget about 1.4, 1.5 and those versions, 1.6 is a great standalone title.  Graphics wise, you have to be able to run this. If you can't run CS at all, not sure why you have Steam. Simple, and basic is what a lot of people would describe the look and feel of CS to be.  If you haven't played HL original it make look a little stupid, but the game is still great inside. Original can't get more original here -- when talking about the base game idea(s).  Great for people with low end comps and internet like Link Freeman and his dial up. This game was made a while back so keep that in mind!  7/10
870	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 NEVER DIE ! The base of CS . Go play it is very fun !
872	1	a	CS1.6
874	1	a	very nice game
876	1	a	Best fps game and first person shooter!
878	1	a	If you didn't play Zombie Plague Mod then kys pls.
880	1	a	RECOMMENDED JUST FOR NOSTALGIA, besides that, NOT RECOMMENDED!  It's the father to the modern Counter Strikes and FPS in general. That's a fact, but that doesn't mean you should play this. We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause they've been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrive and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.  Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Don't recommend, unless you're here to get some nostalgia from the old days. (I still give it thumbs up cause it's still a GREAT game and we can't publish a analysis thinking on the time we are but on the time the game was made, to compare it to it's days instead of current days)
882	1	a	CS 1.6 is still better than CS:GO
884	1	a	best game of its generation!
886	1	a	Really Good Grapic XD More Than Csgo hahahaha -SWFX-
888	1	a	Old graphic good playa everything you need to lost your school average 
890	1	a	  :)
892	1	a	As a CS fan I do like tis game. But I don't have that madness to the game as many other do. That could be because I grew up with CS:S. So I feel like you guys do, just not to the same game. But I mean this game was the start of the cs history so this game needs love! :3
894	1	a	âœ°âœ°âœ°
896	1	a	Best multiplayer shooter ever ;)
898	1	a	Counter Stricke 1.6 is a great game.! Recommends all players! Counter Stricke is an action game. If you play for a clan you have a lot to think about stack areas. Enjoy these in it.! GG &amp; HL
900	1	a	Classics
902	1	a	This game ruined my life. It's an awesome title! I never knew a game 14 years old would be so good and still, it's active in the community! That's really nice! This game is a huge hit in the market and still there are lots of buyers.   It is a little thought for a guy like me who just plays non fps games.  But still, it is really interesting and amazing to play with friends and online too!
904	1	a	Nice Multiplayer game
906	1	a	The original, the best. Don't waste your money on that wannabe Counter-Strike game called 'Global offensive' it isn't worth it!
908	1	a	Nice and classic &gt;4
910	1	a	Probably the best game ever! Will be a great memory as long as I live!
912	1	a	BEST GAME !
914	1	a	This was my time (This is a legendary game of all time ...
916	1	a	This is a great game, I have no problems with this game and it is fun and addictive. Also this is my favourite game and even tho it may be hard at first it is still constanlty fun :D
918	1	a	Quite possibly the purest form of First Person Shooter, only rivaled by Quake. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly the best game out of the Counter-Strike series.  Only downside with this game, is that it has already had its primetime.
920	1	a	I remember being a younger kid, I had a brother take me out and walk for about 30 minutes to a gaming cafe where they have this game being played 90% of all computers. Playing this for the first time as a kid, I felt it was so realistic lol. It was like being in a new world, basically. We came back to gaming cafe every once a while whenever we can afford it. One time, my dad came home early and we were not home, lol. Somehow, he figured out where we were at! Good times good times! This is one of few games that made my childhood memories.
922	1	a	Best hours I spent in my life (arguably &lt;_&lt;), even after so many years I'm still learning... That's ok because that's what make Counter Srike trully special, the learning curve is so steep that you'll never get bored, if you're up for the challenge of course... This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly.  1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a 'thing', hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare.  Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bg's and emo's or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream.. :)  tl;dr: Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.
924	1	a	CS 1.6 NEVER DIE :)
926	1	a	Wow this game is amazing its addicting,oldschool,ragers and more! Well this game tough me something... Rage and play I mean I play oldschool games and i like them but this one is the best
928	1	a	))
930	1	a	REW VYUUWS ARE F0ER P33PL WHO L1KE D1SNEY AND W3NT TH3RE TO BUY A MICKEY MOUSE DILD0
932	1	a	Still better then COD.
934	1	a	When you play cs go always remember where you started! :)
936	1	a	Old but good :D :D
938	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldnâ€™t find the stupid cake.
940	1	a	No matter how many new versions of counter strike are yet to come, CS 1.6 is the best gameplay ever whatsoever it may be.
942	1	a	This game tell me, Graphic doesn't matter
944	1	a	This game is really old but it still have a lot of servers still standing , and there still alot of community still focused at this game, so you dont have to worry about servers because theres alot , so buy it and have fun
946	1	a	Classic game
948	1	a	Best game ever, been playing for 10 years. 10/10ðŸ’—ðŸ’—.
950	1	a	worth the price... during the sales... on the russian store... i guess...
952	1	a	Cool
954	1	a	CS:GO, CS:GO, everywhere CS:GO. Classic stuff dies out.
956	1	a	I played this game at school and the teacher game me an A
958	1	a	Go to your library ; right click in Counter Strike ; Properties - Launch options   -nomsaa -nofbo  
960	1	a	really weird game but its fun  its probably better to buy a different cs game. T.T!
962	1	a	Classic cs 1.6 still the best cs game out there
964	1	a	Best Shooter ever. Buy it or regret it.
966	1	a	An addition to the older generation of counter strike but a link in the game that we have today counter-Strike Global Offensive. Its physics are alright and I recommend it but advise you look at the newer versions of the game but itâ€™s nice to own some of the originals.
968	1	a	:)
970	1	a	What do I need to say...? its Counter-Strike!
972	1	a	Classic FPS, always entertaining !
974	1	a	i like this game very much because it sounds good to play  and helps us in making a duel in any other game which belongs to fighting/action
976	1	a	huehuehue 2006 all over again :D
978	1	a	The BeST oF The Best /D
980	1	a	this game will always be the best out of all the cs
982	1	a	Old, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, just how everyone likes it. It's perfect.

986	1	a	This game is a prime example of how a great game tends to pass the test of time. Although the graphics are very outdated (graphics aren't everything), the gameplay is good enough that the game is consistently on player number charts even after 15 years the original mod was released.  BE CAREFUL: There are a lot of FAKE servers out there. Be sure not to click on those.
988	1	a	It is a fantastic FPS game. I am just in love with this game, the graphics may be not the best but for my opinion is the best FPS game.
990	1	a	Cool game :)
992	1	a	After all these, years, always.
994	1	a	What to say ?  The game is amazing !  This game is my past !  :)
996	1	a	old but legendary
998	1	a	What can I say? My teenage years were in a large part defined by this game (pity about those hundreds of hours disappearing from record). This game is the reason I made a Steam account to begin with. This game made me love online gaming (even if it's a tough, one-way love). One of the first breakout e-sports (alongside Starcraft) and a significant influence on the FPS genre. A piece of gaming history. Play it if only for that, and see for yourself.

1168	1	a	I still think this is the best version of any of the Counter-Strikes out there, and it's been a decade since it came out.

1266	1	a	Half-Life: Counter-Strike contains all the elements of the popular online multiplayer game originally built as an add-on for Half-Life. The team-based gameplay divides you into terrorist or antiterrorist squads. Each team has access to different real-world ammunition and equipment, and all players have unique attributes plus the ability to upgrade their gear after completing missions. Can you do it?
1268	1	a	Good game, most popular!
1270	1	a	Best game in history!
1272	1	a	Best oldscool game =) So sad that 1.5 died...
1274	1	a	I don't even have this game lel
1276	1	a	11 years later, still in love with this game.
1278	1	a	MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE CS GAME!!!
1280	1	a	10/10, enjoyed my 17 hours of this compared to CS:GO and their kids screaming 'GIVE ME BACK MY SCAT-TRAK!!!!1!' 
1282	1	a	Awesome game !!!!!!!! i have many memories related to this game . No words for this game really.
1284	1	a	If you love the CSGO and want to see what CS is like you will love this game. The gameplay is good. The 2 things that suck about the game is the people that play in 5v5 servers don't speak english and I get kicked not knowing why. And the spray patterns dont have 1 specific pattern to each gun, after the first 5 bullets there are 12 different patterns the bullets can go
1286	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,

1344	1	a	THIS GAME RUINED MY LIFE!
1346	1	a	First online game ever that i loved!
1348	1	a	Good old times when i played this game for the first time. I had 5 years old when i tried this game for the first time. As you know, this game is a modification of Half-Life by developers and it's a multiplayer first-person shooter. You don't have iron sight how you have in CoD or other shooter games + you need to know the weapons because they don't shoot where is the aim. It's hard to explain, but this game has so many modes and is awesome because if you buy this game, you will receive Counter-Strike Condition Zero and Condition Zero Deleted Scenes for FREE. You can play a normal shooter games with instant respawn or without it, but you can also play deathrun, surf, bhop, gun game, zombies and so on.  Pros: +The multiplayer is great +The sound is good +The graphics are very good for that year +So many play styles +So many maps +The gameplay is hard but great  Cons: -Hackers -Players who will destroy your game -Kids -VIP Servers who will OBLIGATE you to enter on their servers  This game reminded me how was the life when i was younger, so many hours in the front of PC, how i played it with friends and at school, how i â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off for the first time in a game and so on. (10/10)

1460	1	a	The best of all time
1462	1	a	Totally the bestest game ever. Only been playing for like 120000 years or whatever. I don't exactly how long but I know it's definitely over 9000.
1464	1	a	Advantages: a good idea, an opportunity to play on a network Disadvantages: poor performance, graphics, textures, defects. Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous first-person shooter 'Counter-Strike'.  Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these 'shooters' were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word 'bots', 'contra', 'headshot of', 'ks'. And what is it, I managed to learn five or six years ago. Games then I was not 'tempted', but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? I'll explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name 'Valve'. About 'Valve's' I will say this: all of their games on the subject stopped 'fantasy' and 'half-real.' And this game belongs to the second category.  So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of 'Counter-Strike', ie 'counter-attack', but that's just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade (use 0). And you can take the shield (not a bad thing). We can play for the 'special forces' (which I did) and terror (very few people want). Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a 'bot' that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still 'stupid'.  I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the 'hare', climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.  So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIP-a, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we give money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor (a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter (in reality)). On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough. Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to give no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance. Beauty is not gaining.
1466	1	a	Best game in the world
1468	1	a	best shoot to legs for hs simulator 10/10

1474	1	a	  Very nice game !

1494	1	a	BEST GAME!
1496	1	a	Lemme teach you about the Counter-Strike family history: Counter-Strike 1.6 was the eldest son. As he grew up, people came to love him as a good-hearted, generous man that was perfect in every way. As he grew older and older, the public came to appreciate the work he put in for everybody else and he soon became a household name. Him and his followers became very eccentric and stuck to the old ways. Counter-Strike: Source was the middle child. Everybody expected him to follow in his brother's footsteps but somewhere he went wrong. CS:S was a damn sight nicer than 1.6 and he was still loved by many but never achieved as much as his elder brother did, always in his shadow. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the youngest child. CS:GO was the child that Gooseman and Cliffe became ashamed of. They tried to hide the fact that CS:GO was completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing autistic but eventually it seeped out and now masses have come to love him, even though 1.6 is the best.
1498	1	a	The best FPS game of all generations

1518	1	a	So good game, here, in CS 1.6 being a CS legend is so easy! You only have to play this game and have like 10h on record - that's all!
1520	1	a	Counter-strike 1.6 is one of the best competitive FPS game to this day (even after the release of CSGO) it maintains a good community which is quite well populated (still) bearing in mind this game came out in 1999.  10/10   P.S Alot of veteran players still play this game so you will get smashed, but bear with it.

1554	1	a	gud gaem) plei dis evriy day after shoul)) bud meni chets)
1556	1	a	One of the best FPS's of all time.  10/10 would play again.
1558	1	a	BEST GAME!
1560	1	a	Words cannot explain how great this game is. Upon the release of Half-Life, I was privileged enough to have this game (as well as Team Fortress Classic) come included with the game. I played both A LOT more then I did with Half-Life which I felt no need in playing again after beating it and the multiplayer left a lot to be desired. TFC brought me many great years of fun but like so many great games in the past, it just mysteriously died out and now I am anticipating the release of TFC2 next year. Counter-Strike, however, still has yet to die. Infact, it is a still ever growing community and easily the most popularly played FPS out today and still will be for quite some time, at least till CS 1.7 is released (if ever). I began playing this amazing game from the day the much anticipated Half-Life was released and haven't stopped since. I was what you would call a *pubmaster* for several years where I'd just walk into a pub and have fun pwning noobs but for pure enjoyment. The following years, a friend and I got into competitive play and joined CALeague. The rest, I guess you can say is history. I've played many seasons of CAL and yes, I've been out of CAL-O for several seasons (only played open for two seasons).  All in all, this game is still easily the best FPS out there even after 7 years. Pick it up, and you won't be disappointed. Do not be fooled about CS: Source, thinking it is better or that it is the future of Counter-Strike simply because it is newer. It's a really, really bad game.
1562	1	a	A Classic Counter Strike Game That You Will Have So So So Much Fun Playing It With Friends I Really Recommend Buying It If You Have A Weak PC And Looking For Real Fun .

1606	1	a	Counter-Strike but classic! I must Play for Counter-Strike fans!
1608	1	a	My Fovourite Game
1610	1	a	There's been a lot said about this game already, so...I'll say some more anyway, both about this entry and about the entire series.  Counter-Strike was created as a modification for  Half-Life  and quickly took on a life of its own, eventually meriting a standalone release by Valve. Its development process more or less invented the concept of the public beta. At one point around its public release, Internet traffic for the original surpassed the entire traffic output of Italy. The game itself across all its iterations can be described as easy to learn yet hard to master, like so many good games. Unlike chess and  go  however, CS primarily revolves around shooting people.  On the surface, it's simple. Counter-terrorists must stop terrorists from planting a bomb at a strategic location, or rescue hostages that the terrorists are holding. There's a handful of other modes included with the original, but they're almost never played. Players earn money over each round (more for winning and killing) to purchase more suitable guns and equipment.  In practice, rounds can sometimes end with one team being killed before any objectives can be seen to. Apart from a couple of series quirks that people have learned to love - or exploit, if they're Actual Pro Gamers(tm) - CS is pretty realistic. One shot, one kill and all of that. (No real story either, either explicit or in subtext.)   One thing CS has going for it that I haven't seen mentioned much is that you can play in bite-sized chunks if you want to. As far as I know, the reasons for it not being mentioned much are that the latest game ( Global Offensive ) has a competitive mode that encourages playing for entire matches, and that more dedicated players will often play for hours. Strictly speaking, I recommend playing in chunks: CS can get tense and difficult depending on your skill and the skill of your opposition.  However, the pacing is such that it's not exactly the hyperactive bulletfest most of today's shooters are: matches can end up as deadly games of cat and mouse as often as they erupt into firefights. Related is the fact that there is no prestige (apart from matchmaking rankings in Global Offensive) or killstreaks or what have you for players to literally level the playing field with. It can be frustrating to miss an opponent's head by a hair only for them to not miss in turn, or to be oneshotted out of the blue, but it's reassuring to know that skill is the primary factor here.  Another interesting thing is the individualism you usually see on display. Most players, especially Real Pro Gamers(tm), place a high emphasis on very skilled aiming, but a well-coordinated team that knows how to position themselves on a given map will generally have a big advantage against a team of lone wolf headshotters. CS doesn't exactly encourage team play or punish a lack of it like  Insurgency , but I will. (Encourage it, not punish the lack of it. (Much.))   This particular entry in the series still holds up; its aesthetic is more classic than dated, and you get the no-frills base gameplay that made the series what it is. If you're looking to get into the series I would still recommend  Source  or the cheaper, more modern (albeit probably more toxic) Global Offensive over this, but that's more a matter of preference and polish.  The main advantage this first entry has over the rest of its series is that you can play it on pretty much any computer these days, although Source is only a  little  more punishing on today's computers. There's a fair amount of mediocre (if somewhat classic) maps and no default bot support, but unlike the beautified expansion-slash-sequel  Condition Zero , you'll still find a lot of people in multiplayer; even more than in Source!  Please avoid Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies though. It may be based off this game, but it is bad.

1614	1	a	Best game I've ever played in my life.
1616	1	a	Albeit being over a decade old, it's still an amazing game. I have played it both non steam and on steam, making total number of hours played well over 1500 Counter Strike 1.6 does not come with built in game mode like deathmatch. Hence servers employ  amxmodx  [amxmodx.org]  to create new game modes and modify game experience of existing ones. Some of game modes that I came across are:  Â»   Deathmatch 
1618	1	a	The game of my life.. Playing it since its release.. :) &lt;3

1706	1	a	Counter strike game 1.6 is a great game played by the company when the valve had the idea of launching on Steam platform is one of my favorite games.   Note: The game deserves note 10, the structure and gameplay.   Features: A great game played in recent years by many players
1708	1	a	game from my childhood
1710	1	a	You can shoot people with guns and knifes and grenades and shields, but no flamethrowers.
1712	1	a	The best game
1714	1	a	It's counterstrike, what you think. 100% one of the best games ever!
1716	1	a	Awesome game before the update, it will remain one of the best games i've played. All the memories i've had with this game won't leave me that's for sure.
1718	1	a	ah good old times...1 of my favorite games of all time and definetely the best FPS I've played. this game is very diverse, i mean there are so much modes u can play, from normal team v team, to kz, to surf, to zombies, etc. and even in the modes itself there are 'submodes'. 96/100
1720	1	a	...
1722	1	a	I have owned Half-Life for well over 10 years now. While Half-Life itself was not very addicting, I did find Counter-Strike to be too addicting, I tried to go cold turkey.... turns out that I just couldn't quit. So here I am, once again, back on Steam in order to simply play my favorite game: Counter-Strike. Players on the servers tend to dislike de_dust map, I love it!
1724	1	a	A Great Game fps Which Puts You and your team try ati
1726	1	a	This is the best version of counterstrike....and alwayzz will be
1728	1	a	The greatest FPS of all time.
1730	1	a	Epic game playing Like 7 years &lt;3
1732	1	a	Its an Old game .... But its still fun ! Its cheap ... Fun ... And Almost any computer can run it ! What more can You Ask For?
1734	1	a	This Game is FOr Gamers who take this seriously. :D
1736	1	a	This game is a classic and will never die in my mind. I have not purchased the new Global Offensive yet because I am still stuck reliving my glory days on this wonderfully made FPS. Happy hunting!
1738	1	a	Best shooter of all times!! Been playing it since v. 1.4

1772	1	a	Play with me
1774	1	a	Best fps game :D
1776	1	a	Life is one .. CS is 1.6 only . I will not say it is the most fav game of mine . But it doesn't strive to be the most fav game of anyone . My fav game has to be GTA ! The thing why we all love this game and we all feel the urge to say this is the most fav game is that once this game starts , the human element takes over and we actually game with our friends ( and strangers) and that's what gives us the enjoyment; the feel of competitiveness and who is the best ; to be in awe of some good player and the list goes on . The game itself is not great but the way in which it just lets the human element takes over and be the silent spectator as we enjoy and have a good time , just speaks volumes of the greatness of this game ! The game is like a silent Guardian which governs us as we enjoy our life in the 1.6 way ! GG
1778	1	a	:)
1780	1	a	Great Shooter
1782	1	a	3 best years for me with this game

1790	1	a	Still the best counter strike ever
1792	1	a	Better than Source or even Global Offensive. Traditional old game that comes from another awesome game, Half-Life. You can not end your gamer's life without playing CS.

1850	1	a	Best childhood steam game, landed me a $1000 internet bill, mods up the â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing.. still one of the best counterstikes had fights with family just to play! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 10/10
1852	1	a	Incredible Action/Shooting Game, buy now on steam With amazing HD Quality!
1854	1	a	its a very good game andvery fun 
1856	1	a	Best FPS game you'll find. It's a must buy. You learn new skills, step up your game, meet new friends and have fun.
1858	1	a	It may be old but it still fits the word AWESOME!  It's not all about gaming, it's also about meeting new people. I've met new friends through this game and I hope the others too. Overall, it's still one of my favorite games!
1860	1	a	It's like a GOD!
1862	1	a	Must Buy,  if u havent played CS, den u have played nothing (Y)

1868	1	a	10/10
1870	1	a	Nice game
1872	1	a	If you didn't play that game, you don't know what is true meaning of FPS.
1874	1	a	Just a classic game
1876	1	a	this is a goooo0oooood game only expert man can plzy this 
1878	1	a	Recomand..
1880	1	a	all time best
1882	1	a	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1884	1	a	.
1886	1	a	Oldschool CS. Use it mainly for HNS gaming at bollnasteam.se servers.
1888	1	a	Realy Nice Game :) &lt;3 :D
1890	1	a	So many girlfriends lost 'cause of this (back in the good old days...) + Everything on this game is abso-f*cking-lutely great - Well maybe a bunch of players behave like 8-years old spoiled kids sometimes...but killing them (in game, don't get me wrong) is the purest satisfaction
1892	1	a	No doubt this is one of the best cyber games.. Come what may this game will never die, let the developers make revisions or better versions.. CS 1.6 stays forever!  
1894	1	a	Its a great game, best for good
1896	1	a	good action game :D
1898	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.
1900	1	a	The Best Game &lt;3 :$ 
1902	1	a	First Shoter game i ever played .. recommend it evrey time
1904	1	a	very popular shooting game online! i recommend thos who love to shoot :)
1906	1	a	Good game,but need more updates !
1908	1	a	Yo best!
1910	1	a	good blase morocco 
1912	1	a	i love this game &lt;3
1914	1	a	Old but gold :)
1916	1	a	FPS game.
1918	1	a	When it boils down to competitive long lasting First Person Shooters, Counterstrike 1.6 is king. The unique money system on a two team map design is what puts Counterstrike apart from other Run and Gun FPS's. Many custom maps and mods are available, while still boasting a steady player base even 15 years after release.
1920	1	a	Best competitive FPS ever. Still fun to play even now with multiple other versions of CS out.
1922	1	a	Awesome Game Lve It &lt;3
1924	1	a	Old but gold.
1926	1	a	The Best one
1928	1	a	Still one of the best FPS games
1930	1	a	thnx for this game i love it
1932	1	a	+1
1934	1	a	i love cs 1.6 Steam    and ~Mr.H And Norine
1936	1	a	BEST GAME!
1938	1	a	Old is Gold!
1940	1	a	Must have. Over and out
1942	1	a	That game is suck amazing. It's.. counter strike, thats all i gotta say :)
1944	1	a	My computer is real slow so this game is great for me. I'm recently no longer a n00b nor an ultra-blocking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I still suck tho. Gun Game or nothing!
1946	1	a	One of the best older Games.  Thumbs up for Valve!!!
1948	1	a	highly recommended
1950	1	a	THE BEST AS ALWAYS! :D
1952	1	a	A beacon of online gaming, that despite being a dated title, so many players come back to it because of the well defined game mechanic. There's no great depth of content, just a simple yet enjoyable platform for team deathmatch with map objectives thrown in. Years ago I spent atleast 1,000 enjoyable hours playing it.
1954	1	a	An old cs 1.6 game that almost every gamer played.
1956	1	a	Not the first fps i played, but one of the big ones. Anyone new to CS can go and play the orginal and see how much its changed. Don't forget to crouch when shooting on this one.
1958	1	a	.
1960	1	a	best of the best )))))))))))))))))
1962	1	a	10/10
1964	1	a	I've played over 2.000 hours of this game and I really gotta say I love it. Counter-Strike has always been one of my favorite games to play, and the only thing is that the graphics are outdated, but that comes with playing an old game. Competitive playing is the best here. You really get to build up some teamwork and make some strategies to win games.  I can totally recommend it 9/10
1966	1	a	the best game ever :$
1968	1	a	0.6 hrs lol
1970	1	a	A classic, totally recommend it to everyone who loves fps, multiplayer and have fun with other people
1972	1	a	best tactical multiplayer shooter ever
1974	1	a	Thank goodness this game came out before Steam did. The number of hours I spent playing this during high school would make me cringe. Great classic.
1976	1	a	the best game ever made
1978	1	a	No game in the world can beat this!!!!!
1980	1	a	I've played this game off and on for the last 15 years, and it is still easily one of my favorite games of all time.
1982	1	a	Counter-Strike modifies the multiplayer aspects of 'Half-Life' to bring to it a more team-oriented gameplay . Counter-Strike provides the player with an experience that a trained counter-terrorist unit or terrorist unit experiences .
1984	1	a	Not really know what to say...but still the best online FPS game :D
1986	1	a	Neverending story...
1988	1	a	Third best CS.
1990	1	a	Awsome game!!!
1992	1	a	s 
1994	1	a	Great Game one of the Best

2008	1	a	By far the best FPS game ever!
2010	1	a	I haven't played it that much but i can say that it's a really good game!
2012	1	a	This game would be good if iI could ever figure out how to play it. I got pretty good with the shotgun though! LOL!!!! : ) :) :)
2014	1	a	The best game ever !
2016	1	a	awesome (Y) .. its my life
2018	1	a	Really Nice game!  A must Buy! Its has to feature in your library surely!
2020	1	a	I spent 1200 hours on testing plugins I made. 10/10
2022	1	a	good game mother â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥er
2024	1	a	Best first person shooter to ever surface on to a PC or console. Counter Strike 1.6 is an old game but still very popular amongst PC gamers everywhere in the world. There are many clans and communities that still support this game, so its not hard to find a group of friends that enjoy playing. You can find various moded servers that include Warcarft 3, Call Of Duty Moder Warfare 3, Zombies, American Football, Prop Hunt, Paint Ball and many more!
2026	1	a	The game where walls are made of cardboard and are penetrable by everything except knives, and grenades are bigger than a seedless watermelon.  10/10 would recommend to play with FODDER and I and completely and utterly find the game unenjoyable after being constantly wallbanged.
2028	1	a	1.6 is the best game of all time.
2030	1	a	The best shooter game ever !
2032	1	a	Old game, new players. Enjoy all the time!
2034	1	a	CS 1,6. Great game.
2036	1	a	Very good for an old game. Reccomend to old school gamers.
2038	1	a	THE BEST VERSION OF CS EVER

2064	1	a	the BEST classic game !
2066	1	a	Counter-Strike, the father of all Counter-Strikes. 100/10

2070	1	a	The Best Game
2072	1	a	
2074	1	a	learn spanish before playing this game
2076	1	a	The best shooter ever created!
2078	1	a	:)
2080	1	a	One of the best and evergreen games which i would like to recommend to people, interested in FPS games
2082	1	a	Very addictive :)
2084	1	a	I've been playing this game for almost 9 years and i recommend this game to everyone. There is ALOT of differnt things you can do on this game. You can surf,climb,hide,dance or you can play regular for fun or even try to get extremely good at the game and their is tournaments you can join for huge prizes
2086	1	a	This game goes very smoothly, and very funly!
2088	1	a	^_^
2090	1	a	One of the best games
2092	1	a	Best game known to man-kind. No enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. Per. Head-shot boxes have NEVER been the same and since VAC I miss seeing the cheaters getting caught Red-Handed and added to the International blacklist. I still keep a black book of every IP at the scene of any crimes. If you want to experience the original AWP trying playing OP4. Shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! If you are still mad that 'they' Cliff and whoever took the silencer off the Colt I got the SOB back. Visit  ANTPLA.NET  to get skin pack II. Original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as General Sphinx Brothers of Steel BOS skin pack. I was there playing UK's Ganstawars Last Man Standing Gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get CS skins on Gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. Sort of like a prank. If you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a Luke Skywalker bad a$$. Skin pack II has the 'Starwars' lightsaber replacement for knife and the AK to plasma rifle from 1980's movie 'Alien'. The skins out compete CSGO any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. I got a duo-core up to 1200fps. Well I should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [AU] DeathWish settled it when it got to CS with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. My first game was CS Canyon_Siege and I was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. I am not the Prodigy Inc SPHINX. I have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. It was for Admin Mod then re-written for AMX. Lost. No need for it anymore anyway. People still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. Give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. Essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buZz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. Talking crap about admin was a slaying. Lag was a slap. It was based off Trinity and the server was the spirit. If trash talk is about the 'spirit', that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. That resolved major breach of security. Suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. Most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as STATSME.
2094	1	a	PLEASE HELP ME I FAILED WHEN I WAS MAKING MY GRAPHICS IN MY COUNTER STRIKE 1.6 I CANY SEE ANYTHING AND I CANT MAKE IT RIGHT I REINSTALLED IT AGAIN BUT IT DIDINT WORK SO PLEASE GOVE ME CHOISE I HAD SUCH FAIL AT PAST AND WHEN I CHANGED WINDOOWS AFTERWARDS THERE WASNT SUCH PROBLEM SO PLEASE GIVE ME CHOISE ABOUT IT :)

2152	1	a	I have so much memories of this game. FUN!
2154	1	a	iTs great shooting game ever seen.
2156	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME :D
2158	1	a	The father of FPS games; played all over the world, still on the top. I never get tired of play it. Touch this game and you will be... amazed! (I guess you have already done it, but.. :P).
2160	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played. Dont let the graphics fool you, this game is gold!
2162	1	a	Old good times :)
2164	1	a	Simply the best of the best.
2166	1	a	rising addiction :D
2168	1	a	I lost a lot of time in this game.... this game is legendary - to the end of times.
2170	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER PLAYED
2172	1	a	This is basically German Habbo Hotel.
2174	1	a	this is where everything has begun
2176	1	a	That's great game!
2178	1	a	A game in which you can always come back too. With CS GO and Source also being great games, Counter-Strike 1.6 is always a classic in my book
2180	1	a	This is the good game 
2182	1	a	Good for basic skills at CSGO.
2184	1	a	Graphics don't matter. Just play the game.
2186	1	a	Some classics... :)
2188	1	a	good game but its have a lot of cheaters

2192	1	a	Game lag spikes only when I have a headshot lined up. AWP or whatever it's called is one shot kill to the foot. Fire in the hole is yelled constantly. Grenades kill nothing. Everyone is Russian. I would probably love this game if It was still played by millions and I could figure out what the hell causes my frequent lag spikes. Pretty fun game though, great way to kill time. I'll be playing it more often as long as it stops lagging.  9.5/10 Would get killed by a AWP to the foot again.
2194	1	a	The only game i liked to play cool nice1 just disappoints me due to fps dropdown on flash light and smoke
2196	1	a	realy good
2198	1	a	:8
2200	1	a	Cool !
2202	1	a	Well,what can I say about this game,that hasn't been said before? It's a classic. If you've never played it,you don't know what a FPS is. It's just an amazing game,created by amazing people. When those slow years of learning how to properly play pay off,you just travel into an another world,filled of headshots,screaming people,who don't like to lose,russians screaming at you for being a ''â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ NUB''. It's just one of the greatest games ever made.
2204	1	a	Nice game !
2206	1	a	:)
2208	1	a	Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are great games but let's not forget about the original one, the one that made them, that without it, they probably wouldn't exist or would be different, this, this game is a gem I tell you. Now, you'll ask, why play this game when we have Source and Global Offensive? The answer is simple, either for nostalgia or to see how great this game was back in the time and where it all started, of course, the game version is 1.6 so it is not the oldest version but it does not matters, there could be many reasons to play this game, It got maps that aren't on Source and/or Global Offensive, It has a riot shield (even if I'm not too fan of this tactical item in Multiplayer games) and a different gameplay than CS:GO and Source, If you think Source is hard because of the recoil, of course, it's pretty similar to Source but it's a little different (or maybe It is just me) but anyway, you will get used to it quick, It's not like it was Arma... or real life.  I would suggest it to any Counter-Strike, semi-tactical, counter terrorists and FPS fans (except for those who are COD hardcore fanboys but who knows, you may change and prefer Counter-Strike to COD).  And remember this. This isn't the killing house anymore, this is real life!  9.5/10
2210	1	a	!!!
2212	1	a	I started playing this game in 2008 as a boy in Sweden, everything changed from then on. I always remember all the countless hours I spent playing this game. (Note i played this game on non steam and a seperate steam account. I think the total amount of hours i played was around 2000)
2214	1	a	the legendary game ever made
2216	1	a	Great game, too bad its not competitive anymore
2218	1	a	Best of the bEst
2220	1	a	This is one of the best game. The excitement to kill after getting killed is just awesome :'D
2222	1	a	Greatest FPS of all time.  Nothing else needs to be said.  5/5
2224	1	a	Best First Person Game with low graphics Love it &lt;3
2226	1	a	Excellent game. I have enjoyed this game for years.
2228	1	a	This is the best game i have ever played in steam :)
2230	1	a	Its not a game, Its a LEGEND!!
2232	1	a	Amazing game, was great in the early 2000's but sad to see it die down. At least the CS:GO community has grown.
2234	1	a	Seems that people know more about me then i do. (2k hours on other accounts)
2236	1	a	the best , classic shooter of all times :)
2238	1	a	!!!!!
2240	1	a	This game is &lt;3
2242	1	a	10/10
2244	1	a	321321123
2246	1	a	It's a fun game
2248	1	a	Nice game :D
2250	1	a	my 1 of the best game in steam account
2252	1	a	Dis is a raep off of Blackops 3
2254	1	a	Very Awesome Game. Sure you will be addicted to it... :)
2256	1	a	Yo game!
2258	1	a	Great Game :)))
2260	1	a	I like this very much,is a good game!
2262	1	a	I haven't really played this much compared to CSS and CS:GO as I, probably, wasn't old enough to actually start playing with the GoldSrc engine in a competitive way when CS was super popular. I mean, now it's still incredibly popular for its age, but since I am now smothered with the creations of CSS and CS:GO, I will probably never play it properly.  But from what I have experienced - skateboards you can drive! I simply recommend it due to this!  (lol jk I'll edit this review soon)
2264	1	a	no you want sorce its all people play anymore
2266	1	a	Nice game
2268	1	a	Seriously Luv This Game....
2270	1	a	Good ole' CS. A definite classic and first installment to the Counter Strike series. It's worth a buy if you want to play with some Mexicans, Brazilians or Russians cause thats all that play this game now a days.
2272	1	a	Very nice game. I play it since I was only 5 or 6 years old. :3
2274	1	a	Awesome game  Most fun fps game ever TRUST ME
2276	1	a	This is the worst star wars game I have ever played. There's no force powers, lightsabers, clones, droids, NOTHING. It's like they took out every element that would be in a star wars games. This would only be the best game if they later renamed it to counter strike or something along those lines.
2278	1	a	10/10
2280	1	a	The Best Game ILike it
2282	1	a	No recommendation required :D
2284	1	a	Love this game &lt;3
2286	1	a	10/10 would look at black screen again
2288	1	a	One of my favourites of all time.

2304	1	a	This game remembers me my childhood :) Best fps ever :)
2306	1	a	The game is so dead now, all the good servers have long since been shut down....
2308	1	a	Played Counter Strike 1.6 for the first time when i was six.. as much as i enjoyed it back in the days i do now   CS 1.6 &lt;3

2318	1	a	Very fun and addiciting. To those who are gonna buy this for the first time and haven't heard of Counter Strike before well you better play for a while because you will need a lot of skill to be a good player at this game.
2320	1	a	$$$$$$$$
2322	1	a	Step By Step Right :D
2324	1	a	awsome!! 
2326	1	a	People in this game are divided into parts :  The 10% : Complete noobs who can't aim and don't know how to plant  The 90%: Have at least 1k hours each (legit, I tested dozens of servers and almost all of the people with Steam here have more than 1k hours in the game), can ace with a knife     CS GO is a cakewalk after this 10/10 IGN
2328	1	a	Whatever, ever comes on steam, this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is always gonna be the most epic thing in the History Of Gaming!
2330	1	a	still alive best gameplay good stuff
2332	1	a	Always a good old nostalgia inducing classic to retreat to when CSGO gets annoying, very fun to play and satisfying.
2334	1	a	the best on that, cs1.6!
2336	1	a	No skins no updates good recoil control good servers less russians better servers old style :) I love it
2338	1	a	Play It Every One Knows It  It's A Good Game
2340	1	a	SUD.CS16.RO
2342	1	a	Life is 1, but Counter-Strike is 1.6 :)

2364	1	a	Childhood. 10/10
2366	1	a	It all starts here .
2368	1	a	I'm proudly to say that i played this classic since Beta 4 and followed it's history to unknow mod to a blockbuster online game and to it's downfall (CS:GO). It was one of a kind game at the time that featured detailed real weapons and real everyday maps. CS, i salute you!
2370	1	a	:3 
2372	1	a	  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awsome Game
2374	1	a	CS IS GOOD
2376	1	a	Best tactic and skill based FPS game of all time!!

2380	1	a	One of the best games of the history...
2382	1	a	the one and only FPS ever!
2384	1	a	Your reading reviews for a game like CS 1.6?  Buy it now, unless your waiting till it goes on sale.  Great valve game.
2386	1	a	:)
2388	1	a	10/10 Game, even If it's a little bit old. xD
2390	1	a	This Game Will Never Be Bested, Still fantastic after all these years. Growing Up Playing This Game Was Amazing. The game that molded a generation. Best. Game. Ever.
2392	1	a	Hard and very fun game!!
2394	1	a	Masterpeice in FPS. Old FPS game with fun gamemodes, maps and community. Unfortunately there are too many cheaters, even Steam players started to cheat. But still an all-time favorite.
2396	1	a	Nice game.
2398	1	a	  Nice game! buy i got vacced
2400	1	a	Yes or not
2402	1	a	A milestone in shooter history!!!!!!!!!!!11111111111
2404	1	a	Awsme Game .I played Daily .This Game Feels so greatfull :p
2406	1	a	Still better than csgo, Miss the old lan house days.
2408	1	a	Old but gold
2410	1	a	best classic games
2412	1	a	1.6!!! I have played WarZone version of it for 3-4 years... Steam version is totally better ;) You can join servers where your friends are at and even bots are good at this game :D
2414	1	a	.
2416	1	a	Nice game &lt;3
2418	1	a	EPICNESS! Ummm, You might get addicted xD This game is just awesome..  ~Falx
2420	1	a	The Best Addictive game i ever played.... cs cs cs ..1.6 1.6 1..6.....love it to the core.
2422	1	a	best game after cs:source and cs:go
2424	1	a	The game is a legend. You should totally buy it. It will suck you in and won`t let you go. But that`s what a game should do.
2426	1	a	Love this game. CS 1.6 &lt;3
2428	1	a	there is no better game ;)
2430	1	a	everyone says FIRE IN THE HOLE
2432	1	a	Forever the best counter strike
2434	1	a	Best Counter-Strike ever created 1/1
2436	1	a	This game is one of the best fps games ever. It's hard but it's definitely rewarding and for those who seek a casual experience in a shooter game, there is always custom gamemodes made by the community to play. Some of the best game modes is surf, bhop (bunny hop), minigames and jail too. There is even more. The guns is very balanced even though an AK-47 can oneshot if you hit the head, but that's hard to do.
2438	1	a	this game is better than csgo.....This game only skill no skin :D
2440	1	a	That is most successful game ever produced
2442	1	a	i would recommonend this game it is a very good game there is stratagy and teamwork
2444	1	a	thank u valve for this game
2446	1	a	Top
2448	1	a	Nice game!
2450	1	a	The classic. Although the graphics are an eyesore to some, they have a charm to them for me. Beyond that, I would say this about it:  Pros: Nice community Nice mods func_vehicle Excellent maps Great server variety Good gunplay Nostalgia Riot Shield Cons: Graphics may bother some No official servers No bots No source engine: This runs on goldsrc, resulting in some missing features compared to CS:S or GO, both graphics and gameplay wise.
2452	1	a	i love this game is my life
2454	1	a	:)
2456	1	a	Exciting, fun, addictive - Counter-Strike is an awesome game, but I'd recommend buying Half-Life Game of the Year Edition then simply downloading CS rather than purchasing this more limited release.
2458	1	a	I liked it and used to play it a long time ago but I don't know how many people still play this.
2460	1	a	++
2462	1	a	This game is still on Steam's popular list. That says it all.
2464	1	a	Noooooooooo Russians like in CS:GO no silver noobs, no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bizon ,no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing molotov the old classic game But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ movement.
2466	1	a	Had it`s price risen after 17 years. Gaben MUST get more money !!111one 10/10
2468	1	a	love this game
2470	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME 
2472	1	a	Great one
2474	1	a	Fun to play.
2476	1	a	I HATE IT
2478	1	a	Best game in existance
2480	1	a	  walcom cs 1.6 server cextra
2482	1	a	One of the best game since 8years, that i have been playing. No praises are enough, no time spent would be too much. One of the best game of all time. I have get tired, and if are playing it, you wont be bored of it too.
2484	1	a	it only but kinda good for its time but maybe then why on keep it the steem stoar Jessa Rhodes? 
2486	1	a	ðŸ‘
2488	1	a	I really love this game!
2490	1	a	Great Game
2492	1	a	My first true love of video games, provided countless hours of fun on Gamespy anytime I pick up a new FPS, even if it's a CS sequel, I compare it to Counter-Strike, as it was perfect in everyway.
2494	1	a	BEST GAME EVER... WHO NEVER PLAYED COUNTER STRIKE BEFORE
2496	1	a	Old but gold!
2498	1	a	i had it on a crcked version. i had over 2000 hrs on it. when i was 10-13 damn what a game.
2500	1	a	Best tactical fps shooter in the world and the best game valve has ever released i think most people will agree with me and if u dont agree that means you havnt played it yet :)   11/10
2502	1	a	This is game is good.
2504	1	a	Its freaking cs and 22000 people still play it.  Need more reasons?  Didnt have it on this 'new' account and I felt thÃ© need to replay it. Worth it
2506	1	a	I got banned from a server for using my flashlight  gg    All jokes aside, game is fun, but the community has been godawful now. Game also has a steep learning curve, so be prepared to die a lot as a beginner.
2508	1	a	The same as CS:GO but without the toxic community.
2510	1	a	spray .... run ..... duck .... jump ..... repeat !  its a classic ...never ending Game .   Final Verdict : The best competitive FPS till date ... might not be fun for casual gamers .
2512	1	a	I know that I bought it a little late but it fells nostalgic!!!
2514	1	a	Its counter-strike...... if you play'd 1.6 back in the day you'll love it because its as close as u can get to an updated 1.6 NOTHING like source (thank god)
2516	1	a	Been playing this game since it's birth. I have to say it's one of the best games I've ever played - still to this day.
2518	1	a	this game is awesome
2520	1	a	Brings back old memories
2522	1	a	there nothing but to say, ITS COUNTER STRIKE 1.6 best mlg game that ever lived! jk its not the most, but you know its really good! 8/8
2524	1	a	Good Game but is Hardcore to the core
2526	1	a	It is literally the granddaddy of online-FPS. Counter-Strike kick all other genre-mates in the but with exelent ballancing, skill on skill fights and multiplayer-action wich still captures many players. Iconic weapons, modding opportunities and a large community made the Couter-Strike francise popular for many players. A big contra is the many hacking and the fact that Valve forces you to use the Condition Zero-skins wich are not bad but don't fit in the game as well as he original skins do. It's old but that don't stop me playing the game exesive for many hours.
2528	1	a	Nice game &lt;3
2530	1	a	The Best Game In The World &lt;3
2532	1	a	sick game
2534	1	a	hey guyz miss me??? i m your nightmare
2536	1	a	love this game so much 3100 hours in game
2538	1	a	Nice game :)
2540	1	a	A Evergreen GAme. You can't expect more :D
2542	1	a	Counter-Strike.. my favorite action game :D..
2544	1	a	Ok, kinda old and rusty...but, from me it's (G)old =) recommended 100%
2546	1	a	..
2548	1	a	Nice game but RIP
2550	1	a	Awesome game and is the rawrest of FPS you will ever get!
2552	1	a	This I suggest you buy instead of Counter-Strike: Source if you have a slower computer and you want the game to work fine. Even though its age, it is still very fun. One of the best, if not the best multiplayer you will ever have on PC. If you have ever heard of rumors and what-not over hackers and and people who will kill you with an AK-47 from half the map away. I have yet to see a hacker in Couter-Strike and if your new, you will play on servers with less skilled people like yourself if you are new so don't worry about that. Great buy. Get it and enjoy 9.8/10
2554	1	a	The bomb has been planted.
2556	1	a	Life is 1 but cs is 1.6 .....
2558	1	a	if you want a first person shooter that takes skill. this is where major first person shooters started.
2560	1	a	One love from 2003 - Nowadays!
2562	1	a	Would love to see how much time I spent on this game 5-8 years ago when I was a big player of 1.6 back in the day. Easily in my top 3 games of all-time! 10/10
2564	1	a	This game has the graphics of Half-:ife but is an amazing shooter. It has years of expirienced gamers still playing in its servers and... Dang it random person! If you haven't bought this just scroll up and press the buy!
2566	1	a	Best shooting game forever
2568	1	a	Not Bad
2570	1	a	Haha, this game always reminds me of how many lessons I have missed in school.
2572	1	a	CS 1.6 RULLEZ  
2574	1	a	Now, what's funny is that I bought this game like 2 years ago, and sadly I have not been able to write a review about it, but I'll say, I remember like back in Elementary school like many years ago, I remember it was titled 'Half-Life: Counter-Strike', and during that time, I was always crazy about Military FPS PC games and had an obsession with them as a kid, and when I saw people playing this game, I had no clue but to think that this was some kind of an 'Army Game' like many other, but until I delved deeper watching people play it, I finally came to realize that this was not some kind of an 'Army Game' where you go on missions and do your thing, but turns out that it was some kind of an online shooter where you do the mission with other online players around the world, but when I began to finally get to play it back in my old elementary school years, I would still recognize it as an 'Online Army Game'.
2576	1	a	it's aweomse game!
2578	1	a	What is there left to say when a game which is over a decade old is in top 10 of Steam's most played games list? Timeless masterpiece.  'Graphics are temporary, gameplay is forever' (c)
2580	1	a	*-*
2582	1	a	This game is a very addictive First-Person shooter, which even by its age is still played by thousands of players and I personaly find it very relaxing to its multiplayer and singleplayer capabilities. I recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games which can be played alone or with friends, casualy or competitivly.    I r8 it 8/8 m8. 
2584	1	a	If you thought people dont play old games anymore, you're wrong. Counter-Strike is still a game with LOTS of players playing, despite the game being 15 years old so far. If you have a bad PC, dont worry, because Counter-Strike can run on almost any computer!  With excellent controls, skilled players, good graphics (for its time), a big variety of guns, the huge amount of servers, the anti-cheat system, good level design (official maps), Counter-Strike is one of the greatest FPS of all-time, and I think everyone should get this game as it is cheap.   If you are a retrogamer and you never played Counter-Strike yet, you gotta do it. You wont get disapointed. Not at all.  I dont have much to say about Counter-Strike... its just so good... everything about it has already been said by others... what should I say now?   if you think Counter-Strike would be a bad purchase, you're commiting a serious error. Just go play it. Go! Go! Go!
2586	1	a	Surprised there's still 5vs5 competitive servers. This game is still alive.
2588	1	a	My old hours were not counted but still is a great game to this day.
2590	1	a	One of the best games of all times.
2592	1	a	sick game
2594	1	a	very nice game ! much better than the new !
2596	1	a	Epic and old-school shooter , the best in my opinion.
2598	1	a	i tought wanna buy weapon. so press B what da f*ck doesnt work Buy key i check cfg file bind 'b' 'connect  cs.metin2gajik.com:27015'  it's like s*it
2600	1	a	nah u can rate this...surely cant...just awesome...the pioneer of fps gaming and still has its hold ..simply awesome 10/10
2602	1	a	This is a great game! Nostalgia! :D
2604	1	a	The best game ever made by man!
2606	1	a	I just love to play CS 1.6.. one of my favorites...
2608	1	a	CS1.6â™¥
2610	1	a	Decent game with low price!
2612	1	a	#1 Game that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Gamers off Back in 2000
2614	1	a	Classic FPS
2616	1	a	Really fun and cool you should buy it it's really fun
2618	1	a	Classic FPS! A must-have for every FPS player to explore the roots of FPS-Gaming!
2620	1	a	Everything from here onwards was downhill, but CS GO was like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cliff. It'll never get better than this. Best FSP game ever made.
2622	1	a	Endless fun i could end up with over 1000000 hours on this game XD. Everyone sucks at first because with this game its all about practice and trying things out, seeing what weapons you are good with etc etc. Anyone can be good at this game its all about how much time you put into it as long as you have some very basic FPS know-how you could master it for sure.
2624	1	a	Classical... online gaming started with this game =)
2626	1	a	You can't strike a counter, but you can strike other players with a knife. Or just constantly get one hit killed by enemies with deagles, ak's, and awps.
2628	1	a	  In the early 2000s college freshmen would go to each others house and set up split screen or system link Halo, while true devoted gamers played this.
2630	1	a	Was fun in the 2000's. Not playing anymore.
2632	1	a	People are like 'Bad Community' but its because they wernt here about 10+ years ago, when the community would help you with anything you needed. It's a good classic :^)
2634	1	a	Was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by Mexicans on the only servers that have players called hacker whenever I killed someone  Learning Spanish through this game is better than actually taking a language course in school 10/10 classic game
2636	1	a	Ahhh! Good old memories..
2638	1	a	Im a CSGO guy so i was skeptical when i played this, but its really fun and mirrors my favorite game in the series well 8.5/10 cuz u cant beat the GO (srry if im â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ppls off, i love this game too)
2640	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
2642	1	a	Have been playing this game whole my life (since 2009), played many other games including CSGO and still playing most of the time and will play in future. BEST GAME EVERRR..

2710	1	a	best game ive ever played
2712	1	a	&lt;3 it
2714	1	a	CS OLD SHCOOL!!
2716	1	a	Timeless classic! Counter-strike(1.6)is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does...
2718	1	a	The original was the best but this is a close next.
2720	1	a	So one day I was chillin' on de_office when terrorists came in and took over. Then counter-terrorists showed up. There was swearing, and people started spray painting on the walls and people were getting headshots by switching from one gun to a sniper rifle really fast. Then some idiot lobbed a grenade at me and blew me up. Now that I'm in Hostage Heaven I have plenty of time to slack off and not do my job.
2722	1	a	This game is a classic. I lost many hours of sleep and spent a lot of time playing this game from the 1.1-1.6 clients of this game. 1.3 will ALWAYS Have a place as my favorite time i played the game. Still love to pub with friends.
2724	1	a	Played.
2726	1	a	This is an old game. but its good and have some multimod servers and its funny game and i also play it , any 1 rich in steam can buy this game soo easly because its cheap
2728	1	a	The good old times, a classic upon classics. Looks horrible, still plays superb.
2730	1	a	Play this for 6-7 years and its still good 10/10
2732	1	a	2016!, And still half world is playng CS 1.6 &lt;3
2734	1	a	Well i played my first game got in a lobby FULL of cheaters every single server a cheater. Other then CHEATERS its a Fine- !! game
2736	1	a	Old classic - if you starting with Counter-Strike adventure, start with 1.6 - it's a good start 'From Zero to Hero!'
2738	1	a	Even though it happened to be made back in 2000, I enjoy the game even though it has bad graphics :D. (Played like 1k hours of it back in 2008.)
2740	1	a	Pure, hardcore Counter-Strike in its rawest form. The godfather of shooters. If you truly love competitve CS, you will love this.  I love this game and have a lot of respect for the fragmovies, but it requires skill so I'm unfortuantely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at it. Maybe one day.
2742	1	a	I do believe this was the first FPS game I ever played and I remembered I really enjoyed it. This was the game who started e-sport growing, with players as Heaton, get_right, etc, and you can really tell how it has embarked the industry and media. CS is the top e-sport game in the world. There is reasons for that!  Great gameplay, voice, maps, gamemodes, servers and many fun things to explore in this old FPS game.   If you want to play serious or just want to have a fun, this game has it. I'd recommend to buy it if you want to be apart and feel like you own something that has revolutionize the gaming industry and the e-sport genre.   Or you could just buy CS:GO, that'll work aswell.. ;)  
2744	1	a	Was even great in Early Access.
2746	1	a	What i can say ? Just lovely classic counter strike. :) You are not player if you haven't played too mutch hours on non-steam.
2748	1	a	Good game gave me a good giggle :)
2750	1	a	This is what todays FPS games are based on, in one way or another. If the community was as big today as back in 2004 than this would no doubt be ahead of alot of other skill based (reaction times, sound direction skill) FPS games. I would certainly suggest this game above others.  The only negative is ofc the age of this game. This game is about how good you are, not about how fancy it looks.
2752	1	a	The best classic FPS game !!! &lt;3
2754	1	a	The Best :D
2756	1	a	must-have if you're a FPS fan. This game has started it all.
2758	1	a	The Best GAME ever! &lt;3
2760	1	a	The first game I ever played... And I'm damn right GLAD it was the first game I ever played. Nostalgia...
2762	1	a	hate this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2764	1	a	One of the best games ever!
2766	1	a	Admin will ban players and support hackers.   Best game I've ever played.
2768	1	a	I have played this game for 10 years now since I was 6. It was not on my Steam until last year due to using nonsteam version which I regret. But hey I was little. I still play it even though I moved on to G.O this game is still fun to play with friends or in mixes/pugs. I believe this game was and is one of the best FPS games out there and there is no reason for you not to buy it. Enjoy.
2770	1	a	Ruined my life. IMHO best online FPS shooter game ever made. 10/10 would start playing again.
2772	1	a	if you are an fps gamer aged 25 and up, then chances are you played counterstrike 1.6 excelled at it and was able to relate to it with pride  this game paved the ground for so many shooters, crossfire, alliance of valiant arms, left 4 dead
2774	1	a	i think this version of CS need BOT update, so i can play offline bots
2776	1	a	Best of the best ;)

2794	1	a	Classic. Memories will stay.
2796	1	a	Old but Gold. Way better than Source and maybe better than cs go too...
2798	1	a	It's a great game, that's all I can say. But honestly, how much you actually enjoy this game depends on where you live. Good servers are very scarce on where I live..
2800	1	a	It's alright
2802	1	a	best shooter what i know
2804	1	a	Nice Game &lt;33333333  But i want cs go :(( :\

2846	1	a	Here was my childhood went.
2848	1	a	One of the addicted games.. like it :D
2850	1	a	An Old damn game, but you know, Old is Gold. It's a whole lot of fun when you play decently but sometimes irritating on pubs, Servers with limted slots, like 15, and everything unlocked, trust me, with some basic understanding of the game, it will be more enjoyable than masturbating.  **BEST THING ABOUT THE GAME** The netcode of this game is perfect, is very enjoyable and gives decent hitreg even with bad internet which gives you lag spikes upto 300ms. 
2852	1	a	What are you waiting for? BUY IT AND PLAY IT.
2854	1	a	//
2856	1	a	I highly recommend this game blablabla

2918	1	a	Fun game!Played the cracked version a lot!
2920	1	a	This is the original Counter-Strike that continued into a wonderul series of games. I played this every chance I could get while in high school before Steam was ever around. Check it out to see how it all started!
2922	1	a	if God hadn't a name and that name wasn't AWP I would give him 1.6 seconds to tryhard again yo.
2924	1	a	I love this game :D
2926	1	a	Being someone who played CS:GO before this game, I must say I was pleasently suprised. The gameplay was great, and the community was quite helpful and much less toxic. I love Half Life, and this is very similar. Really fun to just do some deathmatch, I find it to be much more enjoyable then CS:GO. The bullets go where you shoot them, and hit reg is not awful. There is a much greater spread of maps here then in GO, and they are all great. The visuals and core gameplay are so simple, while providing incredible room for skill, which is rare and something I very much enjoy. The only downside and negatives of this game is that servers are often empty, but the core mechanics and gameplay are stellar.  Great pick up even for us modern gamers. It will give you a little taste of history, and what fps use to be like while providing an excellent gaming experiance.
2928	1	a	First at 8 years, since in 2007, A friend comed at my house and installed me a cracked version of Counter - Strike 1.6 . Well I played it like one thousand hours , my friend moved in other country, and when I was playing someone destroyed my CS. I didn't know how to install it again, so i watched on youtube ,I reinstalled it again, That story with the destroy repeats like 2-3 times. I started to be an admin at 10 years, yes 10 years baby, I was doing requests to be an admin and i was telling them i was from 15 to 25 :D Well servers that i was an admin closed , get to the next one , when this closed , to the next one and like that. I always knew that servers close because there is a lot of money to pay to have one. At 12 years i discovered Steam. The first year I did't have any friend on steam because i Haved a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ laptop and i was not able to play call of duty 1 on 30 fps. I continued to be an admin on servers. 1 year ago I discovered an server that I love, I have some great owners that are very nice, and some day the owners decided that the admins need to buy Counter-Strike 1.6 . I don't planned to buy Cs 1.6 on steam because i already have it cracked , but i loved the server so much that i buyed it on steam! I think that i have like 5000 hours of play with cracked CS's :)  I totally recommend this game! 11/10  Love CS 1.6! &lt;3

3100	1	a	Bought this game (CS anthology bundle) back in 06 from a gaming store in Lamington road and it has been fun playing this every now and then whenever there are good public servers for this game. This game introduced me to STEAM platform as it was a very popular mod of Half-Life. It has been worth every penny to buy this game and I still play it more than I play CSGO.  I get reasonable pings (&lt;50) and I am on MTNL in Mumbai.  If you are newbie lookin to buy I'd recommend you buy the Valve's complete pack during a major sale.

3142	1	a	it's the best game in history .
3144	1	a	Since CS:S is practically a graphics overhaul of CS 1.6 all my good and bad points apply to this game.  Only unique problem is that is kinda poory optimized for systems with specs well above the recomended.  8/10
3146	1	a	tbh this game deserve to bee free on the store cuz it sucks af full of cheaters.
3148	1	a	I been playing Counter-Strike since 1999 and its 2013 and it still hasn't gone out of date. i dont think there ever will be another fps game like it.
3150	1	a	People really complain of hackers, i've never encountered one. it's a really good game, Get Condition Zero if you don't have access to constant internet, it's basically the same game, but it's singleplayer and better graphics
3152	1	a	Pretty cool game, old school
3154	1	a	I actually have 4200hrs of play time on this game and started to play it since the 'Cybercafe'-times to play it against friends on a very old version.  This past predicted me to choose just one option. This game is greatest game, which ever was developed. Thank you Valve for your product. It has been stolen my childhood (in a postive way).  I collected alot of great and horrible experience on that game.  Storytime: After learn of the systemmatic of the game. I learned how to shoot. Located the best spots. Choosed the best maps(dust/2, assault..) and rised up to landscape of custom mods as been known the 'heart of Counter-Strike' It begun with Only Knife maps and bringed me up to Surfing, Kreedz.. And after hours and hours of learning. I became extremly skilled. This was the best highlight on this game for me, to stand on a point where you reached the point and can finally say You unterstand this game and his shematics ( movements, angle, strafe, and much more..)  *Nostalg* I might be coming back to this title ... maybe not today or tommorow.. someday, it will happen...
3156	1	a	Russians everywhere.
3158	1	a	There are many things to say about this awesome game... -It's One of the best FPS games ever made... -It's An old school shooter game,made before 15 years :D  -It has Multiplayer,so you can meet new gaming friends and pro players :D -It has beautifull graphics for game that's made before long time ago :D -You dont need to have space shuttle of your computer :D -You just need to have some PC,Mouse,Keyboard and Headphones,and game can begin! -This game isn't for kids,it's for Old School players! -If you want to be good in this game you must have brain :P -You must think about where and when will someone,somewhere come  -It's Really cheap on steam,and it's worth any $ spent! -I love Steam CS Players because most of them playing really good and without cheat! -Hate cheaters (Non-Steamers) in this game -_- -Add me and Recommand my Review :P I really tried to say all good things about this game!
3160	1	a	This Game Was Sence 1999-2000 But it To Now So Famous and Lot Of Addons Are Made Everyday  Very Nice Game
3162	1	a	Its a good game
3164	1	a	I remember it when i was -1 year old
3166	1	a	It is the best game I've played ever :)
3168	1	a	the best game ever .
3170	1	a	Great to see the history of counter-strike!
3172	1	a	BEST GAME EVER  It's Half Life engine multiplayer (+online) base first person shooter - Coop team game.  Great mechanics and great playebility with basic idea creates a mix of perfect cooperative first person shooter (nothing more, nothing less).  It's the one of the most popular multiplayer games on the planet. Over 2milion active players. Before DOTA2 this was the most played online FPS game on steam.  + graphics + mechanics + coop team play + online servers + different types of playable maps (kz, he, de, cl, ...)  - not as much players as before  Graphics: 7/10 Sounds/Music : 7/10 Mechanics: 9/10 Idea: 8/10 Story : 0/10 Addicting: 10/10 ---------------------- Verdict: 9,5/10 (that -0,5 is for ... this game is not so popular as in 2000-2010 ... such a shame)

3176	1	a	This many much good.
3178	1	a	this is a amazing game but is adicted
3180	1	a	Best FPS game I have ever played. ^^
3182	1	a	Its NoT JusT a Game Its a way of living here \m/
3184	1	a	It's counterstrike, plain and simple. Great for LAN.
3186	1	a	Do you still remember this game xDD ?
3188	1	a	LOL...the worlds best game.......   LOVE THIS GAME THT TOO IN STEAM&gt;&gt;&gt;WAH WAH   &lt;3
3190	1	a	It's the year 2015. This game was made in 2000. 15 years is alot in terms of technological advnaces. You only need to look at the break throughs, inventions and so on to know this. So i'm bought back to my original question why do so many people,play thos game now, the graphocs look terroble as they would seeing as it was 15 years ago and so on. I would assume becaise it is because of how succesful amd popular the counter strike franchise is. But they mechanics, movement,graphocs and many more wouldn't be good in today's 2015 gaming standards. Do u just play it to try amd revive the good old times or to simply run away from children?
3192	1	a	Classic. Never gets old. Great mods, Good times. Much wow.
3194	1	a	This game has the best weapons with hard recoil and very hard to master them It's a team-base game so you have lots of fun with friends or random players on the servers Many game modes such: Deathmatch, gun game, zombie plague, bunnyhop, jailbreak, climb, etc. Also it has a great range of tactics and many more things that make it the best FPS and hardest    This game was released in 1999 and people still playing it       I'll probably say the same for CS:GO   
3196	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.
3198	1	a	Great Game

3276	1	a	Possibly the best ever, this is the first part of the world-known seriies: counter strike, graphics aside this game takes full consentration and skill to be good at, not the first time i've played this game, but i just got it for my account, brings back the memories, a must buy for every fps-fan
3278	1	a	Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $10 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.  Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.  There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!  In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!
3280	1	a	Played it for like a minute or so, it's ok.
3282	1	a	Best fps of all time
3284	1	a	MINIMUM: 500 mhz processor, 96mb ram, 16mb video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection i dont even have a video card what blasphemy is this 11/10 everyone is better than me
3286	1	a	One of the most played games ever!
3288	1	a	Possibly the best ever, this is the first part of the world-known seriies: counter strike, graphics aside this game takes full consentration and skill to be good at, not the first time i've played this game, but i just got it for my account, brings back the memories, a must buy for every fps-fan
3290	1	a	This is a best game for me :)
3292	1	a	;3
3294	1	a	One of the most played games ever!
3296	1	a	The game is fun, but unless you're trying to go pro, it gets boring after a while.
3298	1	a	This is a best game for me :)
3300	1	a	  Worst game Eva
3302	1	a	you shoot people
3304	1	a	  best game but csgo better
3306	1	a	best game in counter strike series
3308	1	a	Classic. One of the best and most competetive First Person Shooters ever made.
3310	1	a	Greatest Game of all time!
3312	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6. Not One of the Best, Nor One of the Worst.  â˜… Good Gameplay â˜… â˜… Bad Graphics, as it was Launched in 1999 â˜…  If you're going to buy this Game at this time, I Suggest buy Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.  (7/10)
3314	1	a	  Counter-Strike is one of those games you can just love, coming from a guy who got CS:GO first I think Source beat it by the longest shot in a lofe time.
3316	1	a	This game is very hard for beginners like me. However, I recently watched a guide that upped my skill by like triple:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS5tRoVYFtg   So if you plan on buying this game, I definately recommend watching this guide before doing anything.
3318	1	a	One of the best shooter games ever ! You must buy it !
3320	1	a	Old school fun. LOVE IT. Reminds me of my first childhood PC games.
3322	1	a	I like this Game :D
3324	1	a	epic game really , maps made by nipper are awesome u can drive a car also but the fandom of this western anime was really big in 2001 year
3326	1	a	You have this game to thank for modes like Call of Duty's 'Search and Destroy.' CS is arguably the most widely-played online shooter of all time, and it's still got a thriving community going on 12 years later. It's got simple, easy-to-pick-up gameplay that's spawned a massive competitive community. Unfortunately, it's extremely stale thanks to the fact that there are 3 game modes. Luckily, there are tons of customization options available online. Still, worth checking out for the sake of history.
3328	1	a	:)
0	0	a	You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..

3374	1	a	Counter-Strike is the best game in the world.. Full with teamwork, fun, emotions.. Just good moments :) WE GREW UP WITH THIS GAME &lt;3!
3376	1	a	Get flashed by teammate simulator 2016
3378	1	a	If you want a good time, you'll play 1.6. Game runs in 1080p with insanly amazing graphics. playing 16:9 1920 x 1080 allows for the best visual settings. Although many russians own the servers, there are a couple US servers which has limited russians. Good luck playing this game with your potato of a computer.
3380	1	a	It has FREE, unlimited custom sprays, unlike Global Offensive, lol
3382	1	a	This Counter-Strike 1.6 is really nice game but however it's dead right now because Counter-Strike Global Offensive is out. This game might still play little kids and russians because its cheap and good. In my opinion this game was really good, but try it out yourself.

3644	1	a	~8 years ago, a boy named Joe visited by his nephew, his nephew bring some flashdisk that included A game called CS, Joe Was so Hype to play that game.  ~2 years later he keep playing that game, but he never know that the game that he was played was Pirate Edition. The Community was Great untill someone asked him to create steam account, so he create it. but he never know who is the man that tell him to create steam account. poor him, he still dont know how to use it and abandoned his steam account.  ~Finally this Day Joe can buy a copy of Counter Strike Game that was launching at 2000.  My steam account reactivated at 2013/2014  Thanks Valve, Sorry back in that time i was 8 and dont have credit card to buy this game. . . . . Bad Grammar i know its suck~ Here is ur Potato &gt;&gt;&gt; 0
3646	1	a	The game of all times, you can easely go play it now, there is still a lot of servers with a lot of peoples playing in it)

3658	1	a	Must Play (Y)
3660	1	a	to old,to good
3662	1	a	counter strie is a good game ;)
3664	1	a	A wise man once told me 'Maybe you should load up some Counter-Strike 1.6 and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around on some pub servers for a bit.'. And that was what I did. And it was good.  Then I entered a server with a bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ plebs. Sometimes there would be a player or two that could challenge me and we'd have fun little fights. We'd make jokes back and forth with the radio but when I started asking for nude â™¥â™¥â™¥ pics (no homo), the dude didn't respond ;_; . Two hours later, I noticed a player wouldn't stop trying to jump on a single ledge. Failing, he would back up and then try again and again and again without end and never shot back. I just sat there are watched him. That was when I realized the entire server was just bots and my conversations were with the rare amount of human players. Didn't know what to think. 
3666	1	a	First a mod. Then a game. Then a series. Now, a legend.
3668	1	a	Classic, Buy this game.
3670	1	a	That game is only the best.... I can't say anything more...
3672	1	a	Very nice game, would recomend [ better than csgo ] 10 / 10
3674	1	a	a really good fps game that will never get old :)
3676	1	a	!
3678	1	a	1
3680	1	a	Addictive :)
3682	1	a	Probably my most favorite game ever. The original is still so amazing, great servers, mods and tons of activity still!  Edit: 2016 Update, still amazing. 1.6 FTW. Clutch. Dying community, classic original. 1200 hours easy.. I guess? Oh, em, gee.
3684	1	a	Very fun game from the old school times ;)
3686	1	a	he keep me alive. is the best game ever
3688	1	a	I Playing this game so long its best game in my opionion, but counter strike global offencive is our time counter strike is still nice :)
3690	1	a	 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqB1uoDTdKM 
3692	1	a	The best online game ever!!!! :D
3694	1	a	1.6 is fun but try out CS:GO.
3696	1	a	Unlike CS:GO, with getting expensive knives and later after you finally figure out how to use it you get shot by a noob. This game offer's true Russian Language Speaking Lessons, I have now learned fluent Russian and somehow learned German along the way. It works like a true Russian Language Speaking (and German) simulator should,   8/8 m8.
3698	1	a	The best online game ever!!!! :D
3700	1	a	I Playing this game so long its best game in my opionion, but counter strike global offencive is our time counter strike is still nice :)
3702	1	a	Counter-strike(1.0 - 1.6 not source) is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does

3708	1	a	I think it's fun. Haven't aged very well, but still runs on modern computers without any problem. Worth picking up if you find a good price for it.  Was also my first Steam game, so what can I say?  This game gets 7/10. Still better than CS:GO
3710	1	a	the best game :D
3712	1	a	  Love This Game &lt;3

3720	1	a	  Love This Game &lt;3
3722	1	a	The good old days.
1	0	a	Game full of cheaters nice valve.
3724	1	a	One tip to be a pro: 'Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.'  -Game's Description
3726	1	a	Best game you can get on Steam, but it was better on WON.
3728	1	a	HAHAHA, you guys think that CSGO is hard?   casual gamers
3730	1	a	Classic. 10/10
3732	1	a	
3734	1	a	This game costs real money
3736	1	a	&gt;Never used green text before.  &gt;Used to hate this game.  &gt;Went to a cyber-cafe to meet some friends, they were playing this game. Couldn't wait for them to finish playing, so I decided I would join them, even though I never really played it.  &gt;Died 100+ times with 4 kills.  &gt;My ego got injured. &gt;Got home, downloaded the game illegally then started playing. &gt;Got good. &gt;Bought good gaming hardware. &gt;Got even better. &gt;Got to my friends level (while they were getting better as well), then got better than them for a while. &gt;Nothing else really. &gt;Bought this and the other CS games, couldn't get into them, so I got back to this.   Now I hate my friends for stealing my social life.
3738	1	a	...
3740	1	a	for real!
3742	1	a	I feel like this is overrated. though it is fun csgo feels better to me. almost all the servers on 1.6 were spanish lol
3744	1	a	   I has a plan   
3746	1	a	Best FPS game ever since 1999
3748	1	a	its alright
3750	1	a	You need to have this game !! :) really enjoy it
3752	1	a	this game is the beginning of my gaming
3754	1	a	This game... Is great. No, seriously, this is an awesome game. However, It isn't quie worth 10 bucks, maybe 7.50, so either wait for a sale, or buy a retail copy and use the CD Key.  PROS: -Extremely fun -Balanced weapons (Except for the AWP) -Lots of servers &amp; players -It's classic -It's not that big, it's only about 400 MB.  CONS: -Learning curve is a cliff. That's on fire. -Not the best graphics (Can be fixed with a texture pack) -No bots  Overall, I give this game an 8/10. Now buy it, NOW!
3756	1	a	1.6
3758	1	a	  this game never loses its fun old is gold they say, and holy hell were they right.

3772	1	a	Legend from the good old days!
3774	1	a	Cool
3776	1	a	A great FPS from another era, that still lives up to it's name to this day. If you're looking for a game that plays well, this is the game.
3778	1	a	Counter Strike. The original. A classic! Thats about it. CSGO is better. Buy for nostalgia, and never play for more than a day.
3780	1	a	good game but graphic sux
3782	1	a	better than call of duty
3784	1	a	great game even to this day.
3786	1	a	Not nearly as good, in the ways of graphics, compared to source, but in other ways, it's better in maps! 10/10!

3904	1	a	Best half life mod !!! 10/10
3906	1	a	worlds best online shooter play play play!
3908	1	a	A great game of cat-and-mouse where you either play as a terrorist (plant bombs or hold hostages) or counter-terrorist (defend bombsites or rescue hostages). Either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round.  Counter-Strike is a fast-paced, realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend (it's also more fun). The graphics hasn't aged well but the guns still looks authentic. One thing I hate about Counter-Strike is when you die, you have to sit and wait until the round ends. Even if the rounds are usually short, it's frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive. Fortunately, Counter-Strike has tons of mods available so you're able to play the game in many different ways. This helps the game from becoming monotonous and keep the game fresh.  There's also not a lot of detail in the sound, other than the guns, but that's a minor complaint. The mods, dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and that's why millions of people still play this old-school game. Although there are many better shooters on the market now, Counter-Strike's unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time.  8/10 - GREAT GAME
3910	1	a	15 year old game @ $9.99 really how gready can you get valve.
3912	1	a	best game I have ever played (y)
3914	1	a	Old But Gold ;)

3920	1	a	The original COD before COD got everything from CS and made it into fire wood because COD suck this is supior
3922	1	a	Classic game
3924	1	a	Memories...  You can't call yourself a gamer if you didn't play this game.
3926	1	a	Old but Gold
3928	1	a	The best and most original FPS of all time. Bow down to what has overtaken over 10 years of my life. GG
3930	1	a	Decided to try it out to see how far along the CS series has come along and well it came from a rough beginning (based off of my experience). I couldn't find a lobby that wasn't full except for one lobby with only a single guy playing with bots in a TDM game. Now this guy was either really good at CS or hacking but i've never gone 15+ deaths 0 kills by the same guy. Another interesting thing to note is how the maps are vastly different from their counterparts in CSGO which isn't a bad thing just interesting. Secondly, there is a lot less spread in the guns than there is in CSGO a long with a different types of weapons...well for most the only difference was the name of the gun. Also there were more options for CT and T teams. Interesting to play probably won't play again but hey i need it for GMOD reasons.
3932	1	a	'like skyrim with low res terrorists' 10/10 -IGN

3950	1	a	Back when I was at the age of 4, this is the very first game I played. Counter-Strike 1.6 is still one of my favorite games. This is where I started tho'. From CS 1.6 to source and to CS:GO. But, I'm still a trash in CS:GO  Yes, I do really recommend this game :) 10/10

3960	1	a	I played this game for 909131 hours, steam is liying, and I must say COD Advanced warfare is infinitly better than this pile of crap. If u want to be a proper gamer dont touch this low skill ceiling pile of trash and play proper games (actually only COD) .GET GUD NUUBZ.

4066	1	a	Old school will remain cool!
4068	1	a	Cool game bro ! :)
4070	1	a	Great game, brings back the old memories. Loads of fun, though, still ahead. :)
4072	1	a	Made by Valve Software in 2000, originaly a mod for Half-Life in 1999. The most recently update is known as version 1.6. This game isn't balanced: the Desert Eagle is TO overpowered, USP too, rest of the pistols are mostly useless. The SMGs are quite good, but not as good as the Assault RIfles thoe. If you play this game right now, then expect little kids, russians, or just some wierd guys, who somehow see trough walls and always kill you with a one shot in the head... But renember: this game is amazing, alot of nostalgia for it. I would recomend to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, because it is more balanced, better movement, actual physics, and renember: you CAN earn money!! (when new cases come out, just play the hell out of it, there is a good chance that you'l get it in a drop)
4074	1	a	played couple of hours, pretty good game, still getting rekt tho Kappa
4076	1	a	(â˜žï¾Ÿâˆ€ï¾Ÿ)â˜ž
4078	1	a	Well I mean, it's strategic, first person and it get's the adrenaline going. The game itself is pretty neglected nowadays but I imagine it would have been insane back in the day :)  8/10  
4080	1	a	Great game !

4094	1	a	Nice game
4096	1	a	im have this game key, and awesome game for long time
4098	1	a	Instead of Russians you get Spanish people    but in all seriousness this is a really good game   
4100	1	a	Exciting, fun, addictive - Counter-Strike is an awesome game, but I'd recommend buying Half-Life Game of the Year Edition then simply downloading CS rather than purchasing this more limited release.Exciting, fun, addictive - Counter-Strike is an awesome game, but I'd recommend buying Half-Life Game of the Year Edition then simply downloading CS rather than purchasing this more limited release.

4142	1	a	You just can't hate this game &lt;3 nostalgic
4144	1	a	It's good to be back in Counter-Strike 1.6
4146	1	a	I've had lots of fun and I like the graphics as well, even though it's outdated, but there are people still playing and active just incase if you're wondering or thinking of buying it. I definitely recommend this.
4148	1	a	if it's the original it's the best
4150	1	a	The best old-school fps game in the world :D
4152	1	a	rob weeaboo 'IS' a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing homo

4166	1	a	its ok
4168	1	a	Great game for it's time,it's still fun to run it from time to time get nostalgic
4170	1	a	This game is like Masturbating.  You like it, you enjoy it but then you realise it's bad for you and you stop but then you start doing it again.  10/10
4172	1	a	it's alright i mean it was one of best games of it's time and it's good if you don't have css
4174	1	a	Old but still gold :D
4176	1	a	not addictive
4178	1	a	The best game I have ever played and will continue to play
4180	1	a	The game doesn't require much graphics, hence, runs on any machine. Although it's years old, the game still keeps you entertained.
4182	1	a	Who even plays this nowdays? hehe xd
4184	1	a	I'm getting too old for this.                       Oh come on, you had to at least smile.
4186	1	a	classic game still playable
4188	1	a	It`s really a good game i really enjoy playing with the community neondragon
4190	1	a	The best FPS game of all time! :)
4192	1	a	Pretty good.  CS:GO is better.
4194	1	a	The game is good, but not a lot of people play the original anymore. If you don't have any friends who play this one, stick to CS Source, because the few servers in the original that are populated are not exactly your standard modes usually. But a good competitive shooter none-the-less
4196	1	a	Nice game!
4198	1	a	My childhood in nutshells
4200	1	a	Yeahhhh, best FPS game.. :)
4202	1	a	dis gaem is run by romanians and hakkers and stolen copies of the game. lol pley a better gaem like kuntterstrik condishun ziro
4204	1	a	The best game forever.
4206	1	a	Good ol' 1.6, many memories, not really. I haven't played it that much.
4208	1	a	It's k for a gaem with low grphics. Lol 69 fps
4210	1	a	Graphics are kinda bad but overall its a great game if it were not for this game csgo would be nothing.
4212	1	a	NO Words to express !! Just download and enjoy each second of the game play. Highly Recommended !!
4214	1	a	It's a good game. If only I could stay alive for more than 5 seconds to play the game. 
4216	1	a	The best action game!
4218	1	a	Recommended.
4220	1	a	The best game in the world! Will be my favorite game for life! 100000000000/10
4222	1	a	.
4224	1	a	11/10 would play fy_snow for a 1v1
4226	1	a	Good games, most popular!
4228	1	a	!
4230	1	a	Nice game
4232	1	a	The real OG, compare to others, and they aint â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
4234	1	a	The Original that started it all. V1.6 is still the best counter strike around. CS GO might have is fancy new engine,but in my opinion still does not beat this classic.I will say though at least CS: GO is better then CS: S by a small amount. This game however rolls all over CS: S and CS: GO. Call me a puriest all you want but its still damn good and has lots of mods.
4236	1	a	My favorite game , alot of mods good game 10/10
4238	1	a	Cs 1.6 ftw!
4240	1	a	CRAZY
4242	1	a	Nice Game :D
4244	1	a	This is the best game ever made. Everything about the game is awesome. Too bad its dying.
4246	1	a	Really a GOLD game, we will mis u &lt;3 best game ever :)
4248	1	a	:)
4250	1	a	This insightful and damning critique of the military-industrial complex deserves to be highlighted for its trenchant social commentary as much as for its streamlined, highly polished gameplay. This is a multiplayer shooter with two teams, 'terrorists' and 'counter-terrorists,' but tellingly the player shuffles between the two with ease and there are basically no differences between being on one side or the other, save for their objective, which is often to plant a bomb on nothing of value or rescue 'hostages' who disappear immediately when rescued, as if they were created solely to sustain the conflict. Both teams purchase their weapons from the same supplier with money they earn from fighting each other: endless soldiers fighting an eternal war driven not by ideology but by the military industrial complex, where fighting simply leads to more money and more fighting rather than an eventual peaceful resolution. The graphics could use some work. 8/10!
4252	1	a	THE FIRST IS THE BEST! BUY IT!!
4254	1	a	A great classic deathmatch game that is very fun. Pick Counter Terroist or Terrorist. It's the most fun classic ever! 7/10
4256	1	a	Still an awesome game. 8/10.
4258	1	a	At first a third-party mod for Half-Life Deathmatch, Counter Strike became one of the most recognized and accoladed FPS's amongst the PC gaming community, and 1.6 is still going strong with hundreds of servers available free-to-play worldwide, even after the release of Source (the newer version of CS using the HL2 engine).   Nothing comes close to the intuitive physics and control provided by the old-school Half-Life 1 engine. Clever map design, in combination with a wide (but not overly-acclectic) collection of firearms and equipment at your disposal make for exciting deathmatch-style firefights as well as situtions requiring strategy and coordination with teamates.   The beauty of this game is it's simplicity, and diversity of action: There are no classes, no upgrades or bonuses, and nothing giving any player any sort of in-game advantage over another, save for skill and knowledge of the game. A large arsenal of uniquely-tuned weapons, CS's worldwide appeal and player base, and a plethora of every map type you could possibly imagine make for some very memorable gameplay experiences.

4376	1	a	Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I was just 4 years old .  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. 'Very Addictive Game :p

4488	1	a	counter-strike is a good game for the most part, adding characters and stuff to the half life franchise and universe... there are several canon discrepencies, but they can be ignored for the gameplay and overall storyline (and even how that fits into the orignal half life game :D)  overall its worth paying for and playing...

4512	1	a	Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.  The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories.

4516	1	a	play with friends and have fun
4518	1	a	Never have been a huge CS fan. Never used to be a legitamate player.  That's where Counter-Strike 1.5/1.6 comes into play. Among the other Counter-Strike games I have cheated within them, multiple accounts, and have been banned more than my 2 year old sister can count. By the way, she can count to 22. After been given the opportunity to try the very first, at least on Steam, Counter-Strike 1.5/1.6, I have come to realize that I have no need to cheat. I can play this game on a competitive skill and strive to be better.  Do I recommend it? Yes.  Much more to say besides it turned me to be a legitmate player? No.  That should say enough.  Buy it, it's cheap. Good for its price and it will make you play legitmate.

4522	1	a	Good old game. Addictive still to hard to quit it.
6	0	a	Yet another great game ruined by its community. 4/5 people got this non-steam. Almost every server is not English. 3/4 servers have some mods, which make the game unplayable if you have a low lvl on some class, because how much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s think theyre cool because they bought a premium class and camp in a corner.  Oh and did i mention the servers without mods have no players, or use mods without telling it.
7	0	a	Was it good then? Probably. Is it good now? Hell no.  It might just be me, but I really don't find the appeal behind this game in 2016 - whatever year it is now. Global Offensive and Source are the series' best for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love games from this era like Quake, HL1 and I still enjoy those more than newer entries, but I just can't see why you would buy this when CS:GO is miles better for a tiny increase in price. In this case, its a matter of whether the game holds up against it newer entries or (by itself) and I just don't feel that this fulfills those properties.

4530	1	a	Counter-Strike is a tactical first-person shooter video game which originated from a Half-Life modification and features real-world weapons.  Counter-Strike pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force. The game has both individual and multiplayer options. Bots can be added into the game. The online-multiplayer option is activated via Steam.  Other than similarities in basic gameplay, Counter-Strike is not in any way related to Half-Life. The original version was marketed as a commercial mod, but since then it has grown into a separate game in itself.
4532	1	a	Well Ruined My Life.
4534	1	a	I've spend bajilion hours on this one. Best game from the series IMO.  Remember it's not all about the graphics - gameplay is what matters. 8/10
4536	1	a	and we've got the biggest nades of them all!
4538	1	a	Most think CS was released in 2000. It actually was released on june 19, 1999 (before HL: opposing force) as a GoldSrc mod for free. Later when Gooseman joined valve it was released as a retail game for about 10 dollars. Overall you cannot deny the fact that CS was one of the best games of all time and in my opinion it is slightly better than GO but that's my opinion.

4570	1	a	This is the 'Rosemary's Baby' of video games, a video-offspring of demonic potential...the best multi-player game of 2000, bar none.
4572	1	a	Hello people, i would like to spread the world about this game. Graphics kinda bad, but its about the action, eh? So, it is mainly based as a game, terrorists vs counter-terrorists. Terrorists have to plant the bomb,(at de_maps) or secure the hostages (at cs_maps). Counter ones needs to do the opposite, defuse or deny the bomb (at de_maps) and get the hostages back (at cs_maps). There are a lot of mods, if you dont like the classic mode. But i really think that everyone knows about this game :).  P.s. Im doing this for a steam badge :D
4574	1	a	Wallbangs everywhere. 9/11 would buy again.
4576	1	a	This game is sooooooooooo fun special when u play the custom mods
4578	1	a	Would not really recomend because new players cant even get a single kill because everyones a pro but still can be fun at times.
4580	1	a	I Love this game &lt;3
4582	1	a	It's still a masterpiece today in the new generation.   Counter-Strike is easily one of the best military FPS games of all time. And when it comes with Condition Zero (also a fun game) for ten bucks, it is most certainly worth getting.  Take that COD!
4584	1	a	The origin of addiction... One of the most fun games I've had the pleasure of enjoying and the one who threw me to the vibrant world of FPS, my favorite genre 'til this day. Now, important information: do not be fooled by the amount of hours marked by Steam. There, when the beta versions were launched in 1999, when the game was free. Then 1.6 was launched until about 4 years ago, I had it in a different account, which I do not own anymore. Over a decade of gaming, several hours every day, which certainly have accumulated thousands of hours. By far the most played game throughout my life... You see, the first sentence that illustrates this review was not chosen at random. I had to stop playing completely, cold turkey, or I would fail high school. Just decided to buy it again and play for nostalgia sake. I'm not afraid, I'm much more self controlled now and the fact that I'm not even half as good as before, kinda takes away the compulsion to play. By far the longest relationship I have ever had and we are getting back together... this is a good day.
4586	1	a	an excellent game...but sometimes is laggy...
4588	1	a	I spent 2k hours playing this game Non-Steam since I bought it on steam I don't feel like playing it. :/ 10/10

4616	1	a	It got at least 10 times better love story than Twilight and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
4618	1	a	Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldn't play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, there's no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No 'double kill' or 'dominating' just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didn't FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and one-double tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.

4648	1	a	The first version of Counter-Strike... play it, you'll know later why it was the world's number 1 online action game.

It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City (although taped entirely in Los Angeles), the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being 'a show about nothing', as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life. 
4656	1	a	Love It &lt;3

4676	1	a	Many people in this game have been playing since 1999+, and certainly have the skill to prove it. This game changed the gaming industry greatly, and is of very high quality, though ages like anything but a fine wine. Only get it if you have someone you know that can teach you how to play it. Otherwise stick with CS:GO.
4678	1	a	injected speedhack.dll and ran cheat engine. still not vacced 10/10
40	0	a	Outdated but still fun. Nothing like I remember though.
4680	1	a	 I love Counter Strike, I should end it here. But I'll be honest and say I grew up with Source, wasn't old enough to experince 1.6 sadly. But giving it a try, it's very different, having to buy ammo, see what the original maps looked like before being changed in Source. And dealing with pros that somehow can deal with the game choppyness and inaccuracy. I'll stick with Source, but great game!  9/10

56	0	a	This is honestly one of the worst games I have ever played.
57	0	a	Horrible, just horrible. Everyone gives this good reviews based on nostalgia. I saw all the good reviews and thought I should try it out. Upon opening the game, was a cringy menu. I fiddle with the settings, and theres no damn graphics options! I put the crosshair on small.(Definitely not small) So, I go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps. Plus, closest servers had 0 players. I click on a Dust 2 server with 10 players. When it loads up, nobody speaks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing english. The buy menu controls were so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up I couldnt buy a gun. So, I stuck with the pistol. I go through the middle, and all the players look the same! You cant even tell who's who. Literally, the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing same. So I die instantly because i couldn't even tell it was an enemy. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. I finally managed to buy a gun in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up menu. I find someone, spray at em', and surprisingly it was enemy. My gun starts shooting in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sky, recoil over 9000, and I was burst firing! Absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Another HORRIBLE thing about this game, its graphics and audio! It just doesnt meet todays standards. I think I might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game. Its horrible. I only played the game for under 10 minutes and I already want to kill my self. Trust me, save your money. If you loved this game as a kid, I dont care get it. But if youre looking for a good FPS, to TODAYS standards, dont get this garbarge! Save your ten dollars and use it to get your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sucked by the girl down the street. So, simplest way possible.  Graphics 1  Audio 1  Community 2  Experience 1  Controls 2  Gameplay 2  Overall Game 1.6 (Haha, Counterstrike 1.6)

279	0	a	Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valveâ€™s top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few â€˜dropsâ€™ a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate â€“ the latter of which cost Â£1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.  I donâ€™t pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though itâ€™s interesting enough, but itâ€™s important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the gameâ€™s audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.    I give such context on CS: GOâ€™s economy because â€“ even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself â€“ it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around Â£3 for an access pass â€“ with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.  To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit â€“ naturally they donâ€™t disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, Â£3 a few times a year is chicken feed.  Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way itâ€™s sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an â€˜All-Access Passâ€™ for Â£2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an â€˜Access Passâ€™ for Â£2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strikeâ€™s home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.  OVâ€™s selling point is two â€˜campaigns,â€™ a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like â€˜Win 16 rounds on map Xâ€™ and â€˜Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,â€™ and completing one bags a pre-determined award â€“ either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost Â£1.79 to access â€“ which follow more or less the same pattern.    To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. Iâ€™m happy to pay for Operations, and OVâ€™s combined total of around Â£6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from â€˜All-Access Passâ€™ to â€˜Access Pass (with the right to buy more access)â€™, just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me right off.  First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way Iâ€™d bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised Iâ€™d been fooled by the removal of â€˜All.â€™ Secondly, what the two â€˜extraâ€™ purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OVâ€™s mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, youâ€™re encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard.  There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. Thatâ€™s right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers.  Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission.    You can slice this any way you want, but itâ€™s â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: youâ€™re Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that theyâ€™ll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never feltâ€¦ important. So Operation Vanguardâ€™s missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you canâ€™t.  Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now youâ€™re allowed to do more missions in a set period. Thatâ€™s right. Youâ€™re basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.  The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a â€˜campaignâ€™ in the same way that a pile of biscuits is â€˜lunch.â€™ The missions are basic objectives like â€˜Win 16 competitive rounds on Seasonâ€™ or â€˜Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.â€™ And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the secondâ€¦ I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now itâ€™s â€˜rewardingâ€™ me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.    There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesnâ€™t flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is â€“ who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because itâ€™s a great game, I donâ€™t play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game â€“ if indeed this explanation holds water â€“ then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.  The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah theyâ€™re all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguardâ€™s structure is to elongate this beyond a few days â€“ to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.  I want to emphasise that Iâ€™m an enormous fan and c
280	0	a	 Counter-Strike 1.6: Go play CSGO...
281	0	a	The game is outdated and I don't think anyone plays it. It's better to get the newer ones.
282	0	a	Worst game ever, bad graphics and only Mexicans play it.
283	0	a	i don't care if it's old, i can't play it because it looks like sÐit
284	0	a	wouldn't mind this game if the community wasn't full of wife beater enthusiasts and Nazi supporters...  just sayin'
285	0	a	FOR THOSE FROM CS:GO I'm sorry but it feels very strange, and doesn't make much sense. Given its differences in handling sensitivity, and just everything really, unless you're commited, you'll just got 40 to 160 on a DM like I did. Not the best experience, especially since there was nothing I knew to even improve.
286	0	a	was disappointed with the low graphics technology. i made the mistake of purchasing the whole CS game pack. only decent CS game is CS GO
287	0	a	the graphics are terrible and there's no aim assist why play game? why
288	0	a	If you enjoy stressful online multiplayer games in FPS format then you will like this game.   I just don't like this game because the rules are in a normal match is if you die you have to sit in spectator mode until the round is over. I know there is other gamemodes and mods available for this game but the core game itself isn't the best.

This game is really gay, even the title shows two dudes. WOW, THERE'S NO WOMEN IN THIS GAME, IT'S SEXIST AS WELL. I also hate the bugged aiming mechanic where you can't use your iron sights, it's like the gay soldier's jacked each others peepee's so hard that their arm muscles can't move their guns, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gay game, only turbonerds play this turd.
293	0	a	This game did a lot of neat things for its time. But don't get it now. There's no reason to buy something that isn't an M4 or an AK-47, and if you are a CT that just got a kill, you drop your M4 and take his AK, unless you memorize the recoil pattern on the gun you're firing you will lose every time, not that it helps because anyone still playing this game has been playing for 13 years and will know where you are at all times and be able to AWP you a new ventilation shaft in your forehead from 400 yards the same second your arm moves into visibility from behind a door. Just hold your horses, and let's hope they save Counter-Strike's from itself with CS:GO

308	0	a	I first played Counter-Strike back in 1999, when it was still just a mod. I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90% of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed. Counter-Strike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure. It has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy.  Counter-Strike is bad.

318	0	a	Addictive, dull, and repetitive, Counter-Strike will eat up hours that you'll want to have back. There are two newer iterations of this game now, both of which are similarly wasteful of time. While one might argue that any game is not a productive use of one's days, Counter-Strike ranks one step above almost anything out there: unless you're freakishly good or an inveterate camper, you'll spend the lion's share of your gameplay idly waiting to respawn. More, you'll inevitably (especially in 1.6) run into players so good that you'll be unsure whether they're superlative gamers or superlative cheaters. And in Counter-Strike, there's really no way of telling. Prepare yourself for frustration, either way.   Avoid.

Also my true life story has single handedly brought down the community around this mod, so you shouldn't buy it. Take that, Valve!

4688	1	a	Counter - Strike 1.6 is the most original first person shooter I played in my life. Counter - Strike is an absolute fun game with action - packed maps full of different varieties to choose from. There are tons of weapons from automatic to semi - automatic, shotguns, handguns, and etc. It will definitely give you a blast of fun memories and it's a good game to enjoy for a long time. Check it out !
4690	1	a	I'm awful at this game. 11/10.
4692	1	a	The game is good. :)
4694	1	a	Best FPS in my opinion :3  Old but gold
4696	1	a	Take yourself back to the good ol' days with Counterstrike 1.6. FPS Multiplayer over the net, simple and easy to play, though not complex. Choose to host or join servers on different maps in either Hostage Rescue or Plant the Bomb scenarios. There's no class distinction, how well you play is based on your skill level, choice of weapon/gear and a lot of being in the right place at the right time. Good, quick fun. ***

4782	1	a	LOve This
4784	1	a	One of the most important interactive medias to get yourself better than before in themes of thinking, hand-eye-coordination, reflexes, individuality and so on.  It is like a million little games in one game and you can play it with enough real humans to experience for yourself.
4786	1	a	One of the Best Games I ever played since teenage years, and I still loved it.
4788	1	a	thumbs up
4790	1	a	The Game for all gamer to play atleast once...
4792	1	a	Best game in the world.
4794	1	a	oL
4796	1	a	Best game ever, no need to talk too much.
4798	1	a	Part of my childhood right there!  Playded it on a old â™¥â™¥â™¥ computer for about well over 100 hours  10\10
4800	1	a	Great game.
4802	1	a	Mannn fantastic game, hopefully the game keeps getting better and helps younger generations to enjoy the gaming scene.
4804	1	a	Counter strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential. You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought. I have NEVER enjoyed a game as much as i do with cs.
4806	1	a	Spent so many hours on this game during high school! Now that 'GO' is out, I'm playig Counter Strike more.
4808	1	a	Classic, it is!
4810	1	a	Cool game
4812	1	a	Best oldschool FPS shooting game ever, we never forget you :)
4814	1	a	It's a classic, would recommend for life.
4816	1	a	Headshots, Monsterkills, Rampage! It is STILL after 10 years one of the best FPS defining games (mods :D) ever created. Due to its age is not very demanding on your PC so there is absolutely no reason for you NOT to have fun, addictive, balanced, competitive multiplayer shooter.
4818	1	a	One of the best counter strikes...old but gold.
4820	1	a	best multiplayer fps title of all time. nuff said.
4822	1	a	Father of FPS!
4824	1	a	COUNTER-STRIKE 1.6 and FIFA 15
4826	1	a	.
4828	1	a	Great Game... Enough said!
4830	1	a	Nice game.  10 of 10.
4832	1	a	No other game can match the simplicity of this game. Easy to play; hard to master. Just love it from the age of 8. Best game ever for me.
4834	1	a	,..,.,,,.,,,
4836	1	a	One of the best games ever &lt;3
4838	1	a	ill miss this game. it made my childhood :D
4840	1	a	what its a classic
4842	1	a	Like this :*
4844	1	a	Hello. I play this game for more than 14 years and still happy and would be grateful for your gift to me in the new year game Counter-Strike 1.6 thanks :)
4846	1	a	Although this game was made 100 years ago, it still retains its core value being a great FPS shooter that requires team work and not just 360 no scoping. This game wouldn't mean anything to a 13 year old because the graphics aren't great but to a person my age this game holds many hours in my heart. 8.5/10
4848	1	a	14 years at still playing. If they drop supporting this game, I am going to lose my mind! Best server ever (64.74.97.108:27015) friendly people NO cheaters located in the US join now
4850	1	a	Great shooting game, of course like any game it has its flaws but this is a personal favorite of mine. Much better graphich then counter-strike 1.6. Game from 2006. but with excelent graphich. 10/10.
4852	1	a	Old classic, fantastic game :) A lot of servers with mods
4854	1	a	Best classic game
4856	1	a	Don't..... :P
4858	1	a	Best multiplayer online FPS game ever? :)
4860	1	a	the bomb has been planted
4862	1	a	Best Game in The world â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥essssssss!
4864	1	a	Simply the best fps game.
4866	1	a	CLASSIC
4868	1	a	One of the best old games ever
4870	1	a	Good clasic game
4872	1	a	THIS WAS THE START TO ESPORTS
4874	1	a	This game is so fun. I have almost 150 hours in it. 10/10
4876	1	a	great game
4878	1	a	this game is AA VA SOME mast game hai
4880	1	a	Nice game :)
4882	1	a	I started playing this in 2002. This is completely addictive. Even at this age i like to play it when ever i have some free time.
4884	1	a	Welcome to the worldâ€™s most fun over rated pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured Iâ€™m new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that thatâ€™s stupid, I shouldnâ€™t be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesnâ€™t mean I wonâ€™t still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. It's for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But itâ€™s also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat. 
4886	1	a	&lt;3 this game
4888	1	a	You should know this... it is the game to change all games of its type. It will be a part of my gaming forever! 
4890	1	a	It's a very nice game. If you play with friends.
4892	1	a	We all now Why? xD
4894	1	a	  
4896	1	a	Do not hate the game becouse of graphics. When it was created it was HD but it's time has passed.
4898	1	a	yes nice game!!!
4900	1	a	Awsome.
4902	1	a	very classic game this is one of my memory from childhood
4904	1	a	-
4906	1	a	The best tactical fps of the century!! a must have!
4908	1	a	due to its special gameplay back in the time 10/10 .  now its just 2/10.
4910	1	a	I like this game so much
4912	1	a	Trying to be the best
4914	1	a	Best Game Ever Played. :)
4916	1	a	Old, but Gold
4918	1	a	Nice Game But Not As Good As CS:GO
4920	1	a	Top â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4922	1	a	This has been one of the best and most competitive FPS for the past 17 years. It's slowly dying, but still has an active community of 30,000 players daily.
4924	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6.... the game that set the standards of shooters and paved the way for new video games. On my old Steam Account, I racked at least 1000 hours on Counter Strike and Counter Strike Condition Zero, and all for a good reason, because it is probably one of the best team shooters in the world.  10/10
4926	1	a	Love this game
4928	1	a	CS was the very first FPS game I was introduced to (over 10 years ago OMG), and I've been in love with it ever since.  Makes me a lil giddy sometimes, and compared to the graphics and simulation of today's shooters the quality is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (I'm prepared for some flak), but really, it's like that bottle of wine that has aged and mellowed on the beloved alcohol shelf *hic*...NOTHING can beat the classics.  A bottle of the finest Chardonnay for this veritable *hic* shooter! And another just for me.  *Collapses in drunken stupor*
4930	1	a	i love headshots
337	0	a	What servers?
4932	1	a	Why does this game dont run normaly on my macbook 2008 Aluminium model? WTF. Frame rate is super low, i cant move the mouse, it's glitching as hell. This game should run perfeclty on my old tetris!
4934	1	a	Even if CS 1.6 is old, I will continue to play it until my hands won't help me anymore. Not 2015 graphics but its one of the best epic fps in the history of the gaming for both kind of players, pro's or for those who just play for fun.
4936	1	a	The only one game which could be named like sports event.
4938	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6 we love you !
4940	1	a	very cool game
4942	1	a	very cool game
4944	1	a	Nice &lt;3 It's so better then WarZoNe
4946	1	a	Awesome :D i love this game :D
4948	1	a	Great game
4950	1	a	â™¥
4952	1	a	CS FOREVER
4954	1	a	This game gave me swagger
4956	1	a	:)
4958	1	a	  The game is a godlike shooter!!! &lt;3   The graphic is bad but in this game the graphic is not important^^...   The fun that you have in the game is OVER 100% =)   MUST HAVE *^*
4960	1	a	nice game. runs without any problem on my laptop.
4962	1	a	.
4964	1	a	Best Game ever made :) HIghly recommended game if you are searching for a online game with so much popularity
4966	1	a	This game ruined my childhood pretty much
4968	1	a	I really liked this game because it's very good, Many Many servers and players you can play with I have some experience,but more memories when i first started to play this game. So i recommend it!!!!! to all it's not some strong game that you will be in lag or your computer is weak and you cant on this game,so this game is very small and everyone can play it!
4970	1	a	Classic CS doesn't get any better than that.
4972	1	a	the best Game EVER !
4974	1	a	`1
4976	1	a	my very first fps, been playing for 8 yrs now and i still love this game! imo this is one of the best games ever. Various mods make this game really addictive, so you just can't get bored.
4978	1	a	CS FOREVER
4980	1	a	  10/10
4982	1	a	OLD SCHOOL CLASSIC
4984	1	a	very cool game :D
4986	1	a	so many memories.
4988	1	a	This game is not only the best game of the fps gender ever made but it is also the best game ever PERIOD. It is literally hundreds of games in one. You can drive cars, fly helicopters, fly planes, fly tie fighters, shoot lasers, play volleyball, play soccer, play football, play hide and go seek, ride bicycles, play dodgeball, immerse yourself in the warcraft world, be a superhero, be a surfer, be a rock climber. Oh yeah, you could also be a terrorist or counter-terrorist and plant/defuse bombs on dust 1 or dust 2. There are other maps but you don't really discover them until 10,000 hours in. But once you do it opens you up to a whole new world of wonders. This game gets a 10/10. The only games that compete are other version of counter-strike, Team Fortress Classic, and Day of Defeat. I would give it an 11/10 but there are no killstreaks.
4990	1	a	;)
4992	1	a	012345647567489844113212654884656465484987988946564564894984894654648496496
4994	1	a	Cool game!
4996	1	a	awesome game u should give it for free to pro players :)
4998	1	a	Buy it! Best shooter game! -For Me-..
5000	1	a	this is a old classic and i love it and its all around funn
5002	1	a	This is such a great MMOPG. You can play it if you keep getting wiped out in Half Life &amp; Half Life 2. Though it would be better to get Counter Strike: Source because it has the same maps as the original and has completely better graphics based on the Half Life 2 Source Engine.
5004	1	a	fun to play with friends :D
5006	1	a	My Fav. game...i love it..i play daily.
5008	1	a	played 75 Hours  
5010	1	a	Classic awesomeness. Thats it. No need to say anymore
5012	1	a	Wery cool!!!
5014	1	a	this is a MUST if you want to get better at CS GO!  cs series has improved so much over the years now :)
5016	1	a	ABOUT --Counter Strike-- 1. Amazing Gaming Experience. 2. Your game play will surely change with Proper Original Steam version. 3. Its an ORIGINAL GAME. Don't even do a second guess before purchasing it.   Couldn't Have Expected more
5018	1	a	I have wasted my life on this game, They might as well call it cocaine-strike with how addictive it is. I would strongly recommend getting this game
5020	1	a	This was the most awesome game I played for the first time, and still badass!
5022	1	a	:)
5024	1	a	great game........
5026	1	a	played more than 300 hours since steam is counting. this is a must-play for everyone, an absolute classic.
5028	1	a	...
5030	1	a	Mexicans, more Mexicans, and even more Mexicans!
5032	1	a	An ncredibly fun, long-lasting game, with a decently large player-base with many friendly servers :D I would definitely recommend this game.
5034	1	a	The best ever
5036	1	a	 http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j8/guv_is/fullteam0lpju3.gif 
5038	1	a	Nice game :D
5040	1	a	Best of game!
5042	1	a	The Best of his kind.
5044	1	a	Nice Game.The Best First Person Shooter Game! &lt;3
5046	1	a	..
5048	1	a	C.S. has got to be one of the best FPS of all time. It really was the game that made gaming what it is today. I still remember at high school everyone going to the internet cafe and paying to book out the whole place to just play C.S with all our friends. A great game which will always be an epic part of FPS history.
5050	1	a	â™¥
5052	1	a	One of the first First-person shooter games I ever played, and I'm so glad it was. This game was amazing and I easily clocked 1000 hours over the years of playing. For it's price now, you should definitely buy it. Source is good and all, but the original of the series is the best, by far.
5054	1	a	Its awesome
5056	1	a	The best FPS game I have ever played. Many people are leaving this version of game saying that it is not upto the mark, but this is best base for all FPS games for which I respect this game and will play it forever.
5058	1	a	this game is simply great and skill based the problem though is that most people who still play it are super experts litterly shooting through walls and kiling you when you spawn also the population is not to high but still there for the price i think it's worth a buy
5060	1	a	im the best bro
5062	1	a	Best shooter game :) I love it ! :D
5064	1	a	The quentissential competitve FPS. Get it you won't regret it, unless you suck balls.
5066	1	a	BACK in the dayy!...
5068	1	a	Probably this game doesn't need any introduction, old and good, still played by a large number of gamers, on of the best online shooter that was created. Still remember my first days finding a good version of the game and playing with bots.
5070	1	a	Always a pleasure to kill you :)
5072	1	a	You have to own Counter-Strike if you even have the slightest interested in First Person Shooters.
5074	1	a	Very nice game. Most addicted multiplayer game of all time!!
5076	1	a	All-time classic game. Will always be my number one counter strike version.
5078	1	a	It's 1.6, nuff said.
5080	1	a	May be old but still worth it to get it.  
5082	1	a	The best :&gt;
5084	1	a	The Greatest Game of All Time
5086	1	a	It's very drake.
5088	1	a	The one that started it all.
5090	1	a	Oldie, but far more than goldie!
5092	1	a	Counter-Strike is a FPS/Tactical Shooter where two teams are fighting; Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists. Multiple game modes like: Save Hostage or Explode/Defuse the bomb. The action is very fast. It is one of the most played game from gaming championship.
5094	1	a	:)
5096	1	a	One of the legendary games which is still fun to play after 15 years of making .   Proves even without graphics and mechanincs what a game can achive. Those who love multiplayer and have not bought this game ( totally worth it !! ) I recomend you try it out :) ..   Gamplay centered game.  If you have friends to play along this game is totally worth spending time on . Extremely addictive ...
5098	1	a	Greatest game ever created.
5100	1	a	This game legend!
5102	1	a	Pew pew.  Grew up with this pew pew so I can't say anything bad about it. I do think it has aged a bit and that CS:S has preceded it but I also know there are people who think that there ain't no better CS than 1.6.. or 1.5... or 1.3... well to each his own.  Pew pew with a ROUGH difficulty curve. If you come from the casual CoD MP crowd you quite possibly will hit a wall straight away. But this game is far more rewarding to get into. The better you get at it, the more enjoyable it gets.
5104	1	a	I've spent over 5000hours on this game, how can I hate it? 10/10 best cs ever made hl1 :3
5106	1	a	cool 
5108	1	a	Very good game the mother of all FPS games !
5110	1	a	Nice to all who like a Classic online shooter in which u can play against good others. Allthough like all other online games there are some idiots. but if u dont care about them its really nice to play
5112	1	a	good graphics, great fun!
5114	1	a	First game I played. Only game I loved so much.
5116	1	a	It's a good game.
5118	1	a	In my opinion 1.6 has less hacker than Counter-Strike:Global Offensive. Then again 1.6 is made up of a few servers with small coumminty base and more than likely has an admin in game. Best physics in any Counter-Strike game. Probably not top notch graphics.. Just get your friends and have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5120	1	a	Beats Call Of Duty crap every day of the week.
5122	1	a	lot of hackers ....bt gg!!!
5124	1	a	great game!
5126	1	a	Just amAzing &lt;3.. most complete first person shooter game :D
5128	1	a	Best fps for life! Have been playing it since 2002. Never gets old!

5144	1	a	Fun classic game involiving alot of strategy and team tactics. Hard to get used to.
5146	1	a	Best online game :D......
5148	1	a	counter strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential. You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought. I have NEVER enjoyed a game as much as i do with cs
5150	1	a	nice game, great gameplay, graphics is poor as hell
5152	1	a	Check out the real one! Not the ones, where they increased movement speed. The Hardcore-game.
5154	1	a	CS :)
5156	1	a	Bored of CS:GO? Nothing beats the original!
5158	1	a	:)
5160	1	a	I think it`s the best of the Counter-Strike. Graphics aren`t good but it`s not most important part of this game.
5162	1	a	the best game
5164	1	a	
5166	1	a	-_-
5168	1	a	No doubt this is the best online game
5170	1	a	legendary game but the sad thing is there are so much cheaters.. =/
5172	1	a	Skill Teamwork Tacticas Fun
5174	1	a	Great game with an active community! Just dont expect to be playing any normal missions any time soon, i also enjoy the smoke in this installment, you can see through it if you walk right through it, also it is suprisingly difficult for the first installment, maybe im just bad, i dont know, so anyways get this game if you like team based FPS' if you dont like that genre, i reccomend you skip this one, 7/10
5176	1	a	Best version of CS made.
5178	1	a	Addictive! (y)
5180	1	a	..
5182	1	a	nice shooter
5184	1	a	i love this game &lt;3

5190	1	a	^^
5192	1	a	...
5194	1	a	1.6 will always be my fav. &lt;3
5196	1	a	Best FPS of all time
5198	1	a	Old but gold
5200	1	a	Old game, still played by many, still ok, but time to move on to CS:GO.
5202	1	a	..
5204	1	a	This game is really awesome. This made my childhood awesome!
5206	1	a	Just simply the best game ever &lt;3

5230	1	a	It's not a game... It's THE game. Simple as that!
5232	1	a	it's a very good game for relaxation and even for joy... the best part of it is defending others!
5234	1	a	Great Addictive Game. This is the ultimate 1st first person shooter! Did you get my pun :)
5236	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 is most popular game i think, i like community of players , simple game, definetly recommending to play it, more joy :)
5238	1	a	!
5240	1	a	One of the best online multiplayer games of all time.
5242	1	a	Potatoes have skin, I have skin, therefore i am a potato
5244	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5246	1	a	The mother of all.....
5248	1	a	I love this game it's such a classic that stands the test of time I highly recommend it
5250	1	a	Best fps game before csgo :)
5252	1	a	Must play game.
5254	1	a	I highly recommend this game if you are into FPS games. This is the legendary game that started it all. Trust me, if you buy this game you won't regret it. It's graphics for 17 or more year old game, are pretty good. It has good servers and alot fun mini-games to them. ;)
5256	1	a	One of the most groundbreaking and legendary Multiplayer games in the history of video games. All created by 1 guy in his college dorm, in this spare time. It doesn't get any more awesome than that.
5258	1	a	Best game in the history of ever &lt;3
5260	1	a	It's a fun game that used to be a top multiplayer game, but got overshadowed by it's source remake and CS:GO
5262	1	a	Much better then the new counter strike games.
5264	1	a	One Word. Amazing.
5266	1	a	Oh yes this is the best game to play with friends!!
5268	1	a	.
5270	1	a	The most popular FPS ever- (After UT/Q)
5272	1	a	:)
5274	1	a	This game is the game that started the Counter-Strike series. It started as a mod for the game that started it ALL, Half-Life. Like Team Fortress, Counter-Strike became a standalone game after its' popularity as a mod. If you enjoy the old Half-Life engine, GoldSrc, and want to play a shooter that doesn't have a complicated story and chapters, Counter-Strike is the game for you. Condition Zero is the same game but with a 'campaign mode' that allows you to play with bots and unlock maps as you go.
5276	1	a	The best game ! :)
5278	1	a	The best miltuplayer game ever. Love it always.
5280	1	a	A Classic shooter that everyone still play and enjoy, A game that almost any male person in my country has played.
5282	1	a	BEST MULTIPLAYER GAME...(csgo is the 2nd best multiplayer game)
5284	1	a	classic!

5294	1	a	the best game ever
5296	1	a	Although most of the servers are full of all-caps spamming people from foreign countries talking smack to one another, the game is still excellent. You should be learning how to play on this before making the switch to CSGO.

5318	1	a	The old Classic Counter-Strike. The best CS, and the game that got FPS Gaming on the map.

5400	1	a	THIS IS A NICE GAME
5402	1	a	(2005-2012)Legendary game, regular online. (2012-2014)Dying soldier. (Today)Oldschools' carousel. You can get some old feelings, but not much more. So, that's not a useless waste of money.
5404	1	a	like the other CS games but can run on any potato
5406	1	a	Hii , Why do not I see the publication of the counter I play .. and I see the table several killed up no picture .. Why ? Ndirr this game .. and someone could help me please?
5408	1	a	SImply a classic game, nothing will ever match the tension of being the last terrorist on your team and trying to detonate the bomb, has it aged well? Pfft no, but if you want to experience what got many people into online shooters then buy it. You honestly deserve it. Unless you have the new Counter-Strike.
5410	1	a	Its a really good game if you are good at it and got time to spend!
5412	1	a	The one and only yeah..
5414	1	a	Worth every penny! Great game!
5416	1	a	Is a'ight
5418	1	a	CS:GO NEXT GEN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5420	1	a	Having only played CSGO for the past year or so, it is really nice to see what that game was rooted off of. I now know playing 1.6 what all the hype about Counter Strike is and the history behind it. 1.6 for it's time period was such a benchmark game. Really awesome!
5422	1	a	This is the only PC Game which I play till to date from the time it was released. I am playing this game for past twelve or thirteen years and I am still very much addicted to it. The game play is phenomenal, highly challenging and had a very realistic feeling during then. The recoils are amazing and very realistic. This was the only game of its period to have gun recoil. The whole game playing skills revolved around the ability to control the gun's recoil which was its best feature.   Great game of all times !!!  Cheers!
5424	1	a	The most beautiful game i've ever seen!
5426	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WujdtsHUWVg 
5428	1	a	game,that madeâ€‹â€‹ history!
5430	1	a	Absolutely speechless, is what I am when I think of the Counter-Strike series. Look at this game, it was one of the most detailed FPS's for it's time and it still has it. No game series has been able to remake CS's addictiveness or its smooth gameplay. This game is one of the few titles that still requires skill, every weapon is earned and every weapon requires its own type of mastery. A truly great title that me and many others will return to play for a very long time.
5432	1	a	This game is good... ...But be owned by professionals who have been playing when it was on WON.
5434	1	a	this game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good damn son â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5436	1	a	The classic shooter upgraded with modern controls: Counter-Strike was something unseen, yet highly needed in the late 90's and early 00's. It carried with it the idea that you didn't need a single player 'story mode' to make ripples in the video game industry. As future competitors would attempt to reflect, all CS needed was an incredible skill-based gameplay with a start-of-the-art ability to play against players from around the world. Toss in some alternate gameplay styles to help break up the chance of monotonous moments and throw it all over a large assortment of levels for good measure; youâ€™ll end up with a dish that, for years, has been best served with a dedicated server and a good group of friends. It's no wonder that CS gave birth to some of the best online team play the world has ever seen and continues in that tradition to this day. If you haven't played the original Counter-Strike yet, you're missing a small part of your soul... hurry, go get it back by quick scoping with an AWP down Long A on de_dust2.
5438	1	a	Pfff.... Nothing much too say the game's old odseivly I don't reccomend it anymore but for the time this game was realised it truly shined.
5440	1	a	nice shooting game
5442	1	a	Nice OLD School Game ;)

5446	1	a	I don't dislike, like, love or hate this game,
5448	1	a	) 
5450	1	a	Best online FPS ever. The simplicity of this game makes it one of the most fun to play, with a match never the same to another. The Steam version has no changes or bonuses whatsoever.
5452	1	a	So, the original CS, where it all begun. Great game which made a great series!
5454	1	a	where there is cs der are gamers i would blindly buy this game withoput any hesitation
5456	1	a	It's nice

5466	1	a	I'M LOVE &lt;3 COUNTER-STREKE 1.6
5468	1	a	Best 1st person shooter of all time. Even all these years after its release, its still the game i end up playing. Ive been playing cs off and on since 2005 and i still love it just as much. The gameplay is perfect and flows perfectly.

5506	1	a	good game, one of the best made in its time 10/10
5508	1	a	This game is the most impressive game I've ever played since I was a child . I recommand this game to all of you .
5510	1	a	#SoEasyForMe

5518	1	a	Good Game for ever!!!!
5520	1	a	i really wish for this game to be mine , a very competitive and team-dependent game, with lots of action , really good to relax your nerves , i played it for hundreds of hours (not the original , of course) 10/10
5522	1	a	Very good classic shooter game.
5524	1	a	:D WOW. its so F***ing old game. I mean every body is just counter GO now. but i still love this game and love its bugs.
5526	1	a	Am ban pe eac xD
5528	1	a	First, and best game I ever had on steam. I dont like cs:go at all, I only play cs 1.6 4 life :))
5530	1	a	Easily the best FPS game ever made, ever.
5532	1	a	Back to basics!
5534	1	a	Nice game !
5536	1	a	The developers of the Half-Life Mod, Counter-Strike really knew what they were doing when they said they wanted to construct a mod like no other. It was, like Half-Life, something new for the public to lay their bored eyes on. There never before was a mod about Terrorism vs Counter Terrorism, and thanks to the two developers of the game, it happened. Why Terorrism vs Counter Terrorism though? It was only something new and that is it. It was something to literally 'wow' the public with intense competitive multiplayer gameplay. It was something people actually payed attention to and thought it off as a sport. So fourth, this mod has been recognized so much that more installments have appeared, and that is an amazing thing for a game that once started off as a mod. Just like Team Fortress and how that continued on into Team Fortress 2. I have yet to play Global Offensive but I will do that some time in the future.  Its games like these that always amaze me with their originality. And I believe Counter-Strike is one of those games that deserves to be noticed and introduced to FPS fans across the world.   This is a must buy/play.
5538	1	a	;
5540	1	a	Good game, most popular,
5542	1	a	Good old game.

5614	1	a	Best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game ever. This awesome.
5616	1	a	Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.  Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youâ€™re a Call of Duty player, youâ€™re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what itâ€™s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.  For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.  Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.  Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnâ€™t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.  Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.  If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.  Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas â€“ entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location â€“ but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.  Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.  If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game.

5680	1	a	Best FPS Game ever, but i can say it's already dead for 2 years now cause VAC cannot hunting the hackers anymore.. Visit My Server : 94.23.30.179:27020
5682	1	a	Better, more addictive, and easier than CS:GO Alot of people still play it, and its counterstrike. So buy it.
5684	1	a	:)
5686	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
5688	1	a	Old school fps game,
5690	1	a	The best CS of all. (excluding 1.5 - that was the actual best)
5692	1	a	This game is LIFE! &lt;3 CS 1.6 forever green !
5694	1	a	What is there really to be said about this game? It's Counter-Strike! It's where all games get their inspiration from. It's what all the best shooters aim to be. It's been out since 1999 and is still more popular than all of the current games out there. This game will never die, will never lose it's fan base and will always be the best. If you have to think about buying this game then chances are you are some Halo or COD fanboy who can't handle REAL gaming on PC.
5696	1	a	Love CS!
5698	1	a	Best of the best! ^_^
5700	1	a	Old but gold!
5702	1	a	go back in time and play this pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, yes please.
5704	1	a	;)
5706	1	a	:)

5710	1	a	The Chess of FPS
5712	1	a	If you love intense, enjoyable, and competitive FPS games then this is the game for you, Why you may ask? It is one of the most decorated Shooter games of the 20/21st centuries.
5714	1	a	Very fun game, I played it a lot when I was much younger.  child memories right here
5716	1	a	Great game! I never played it much because of other great counter-strikes but I wish I had, out of all of these I have enjoyed this the most, high fps, decent graphics and simplistic. Good game to enjoy with friends and is totally worth the money, if not it is worth more! Just because it came out in 2000 doesn't mean you have to stop caring. CS:GO is good but no game is ever better than this!
5718	1	a	this game is made by gods never take many hours to multyplayer mmorpg games exept but esteque fps truth is very good game
5720	1	a	The original that started it all, Counter-Strike paved the way for future competitive online-multiplayer shooters, as well as the modding community. It may not be as big as Global Offensive, but it sure is fun in the current year.
5722	1	a	Nice game!
5724	1	a	I liked this game
5726	1	a	Almost all the games that I have in the library - excellent. In a review on Counter-Strike GO I have already stated my opinion.

5778	1	a	lots of fun !!
5780	1	a	THIS GAME SHOULD BE REQUIRED ATLEAST 100HOURS LOGGED BEFORE ANYONE CAN PLAY CSGO.
5782	1	a	This game is 16 years old still has all it's glory as the old days still one of the best FPS's ever and second on my list of all time favorites, and even after 16 years the game is still being played at a large rate, Highly recommend this game, if you can master this work of art you can just about be a master at any other FPS
5784	1	a	Good old Counter-Strike... We won't forget!
5786	1	a	nice oldschool game :D
5788	1	a	World's Number 1 online action game.
5790	1	a	Wordless... 10/10
5792	1	a	Classic, simply beautifull. This is where it all began.
5794	1	a	You never heard about Counter-Strike? wah, lol.

5810	1	a	Lot's of Fun in this classic CS, brings back Nostalgic days when i played it back in a LAN room, EXPECT A CLASSIC FPS FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!

5814	1	a	BEST GAME OUT ! 
5816	1	a	Time to say goodbye to the grandpa! :) However, it is one of the most popular online games ever.
5818	1	a	Based off of the acclaimed Half-Life mod, Counter-Strike is one of the most beloved FPS is recent memory. A team based tactical shooter with a simple concept but complex way of using it. For any Counter-Strike collector, you have to get the original!
5820	1	a	counter strike is my life.
5822	1	a	Fells good to play the original. Still hard at times because CS:GO is many years after this game, but fells good to play!
5824	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !
5826	1	a	if you like team based strategy and some good ol' fps â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this b the game for u mon
5828	1	a	the most legendary game of all time it was released in 1999, but players do play in 2015 so the game itself tells alot about it. moreover it's version r updated about every 4 to 5 years latest is now i think is COUNTER STRIKE GLOBAL OFFENSE . some of the most famous players were markeloff,potty,get_right,guardian nd some famous teams were - NAVI, SK GAMING, etc. in india there r teams like NSD who won asian champoinship from 2006 to 2012 till cs go released . it was now suffering from DDOS attack in india nd because of that players r shifting to csgo.  THANKYOU

5846	1	a	classic and still fun to play
5848	1	a	Awesome game, luv it
5850	1	a	I spent a better part of my childhood playing this game, back before Steam became the ubiqitious gaming medium (read: Valve's money-making lovechild) for 'shut up and take my damn money'. How can I describe this game? What one phrase summarizes the ostensive thrust of epic time sink that is Counter-Strike?   Easy - 'just one more round!' And the whirlpool of regret washes over you as dusk turns to dawn and you realize that you didn't study for your freakin' biology exam. For shame. Too bad this box isn't large enough to contain my stories of grand LAN parties. Needless to say, this was an amazing game.  Though after years passing, the humor lies in sadness that the same 13 year olds that I left behind are still playing.. Worse yet, they're being domineered by server admins who are exactly 1 year older! (I figure a bedtime extension merits you the ability to ban &amp; kick players).  So yeah, before the new CS comes out, spend some time acquainting yourself with this FPS tour de force.
5852	1	a	I've been playing since the days before steam. I've spent hours upon hours playing and I still talk to some clan-mates from our 'CAL' days. Great times, great game.
5854	1	a	Legendary game!
5856	1	a	Amazing game for very fast FPS actions !
5858	1	a	250 hours of playing pixelated CS:GO.
5860	1	a	Russians:The game
5862	1	a	Fire in the hole!
5864	1	a	The best game of all times
5866	1	a	any one help me my cs is not installed any one suggetion me.................. :P :D 
5868	1	a	The CS 1.6 Community is 90% Mexican, 9% Russian, and 1% English
5870	1	a	Before there was a Call of duty. Before there was a Battlefield, Before there was a Halo. There was one multi player FPS that reigned supreme. Because all the new comers migrate to CS GO, the community is made up of mostly older, more mature people.
5872	1	a	Had over 9000+ hours on this game on an alternative account. A really GREAT FPS i totally recommend a game like this, any Counter-Strike actually is good.
5874	1	a	I have a lot of hours on non-steam version. COUNTER STRIKE FOREVER!
5876	1	a	AHA POLECAM TO GOWNo
5878	1	a	Wow.  This is a game I grew up with and it's one of the most popular online first-person-shooters out there, or atleast; it used to be. The game was everywhere, and it had its reasons to. This was the game that was seen on the computer screens of the LAN parties, tournaments and other major computer related events.  It's action-packed, skill-based and it had a huge following. Even today you may find lots of server filled with players. The gameplay surrounds around you and your team. If you play the 'DE maps' you're a terrorist, you must plant the bomb and make sure that the CT's won't defuse it and if you're in the CT team, you must defuse the bomb before it goes off. If you play the 'CS maps' you must rescue the hostages as a CT and if you're on the terrorist team you must keep the hostages held-up and eliminate any CT that tries to stop you. Any round can also be won by eliminating the opponents.  This game spawned a franchise and will always be remembered as one of the starting grounds of multiplayer, teambased first-person-shooters.  The game is from 2000 and is outdated by its succesor; Global Offensive. But if you're into old games, you should check this out but I highly doubt you haven't heard of this game before.
5880	1	a	Rabadabum. cs is still alive.
5882	1	a	fun for the 3 seconds of each round i'm alive for.
5884	1	a	After a long break i decided to download CS and see if it's still alive. It is... barely. All these years on and still the best game ever created. Good memories! Better than any CS games that followed. They just don't make games like this anymore. CS:GO is a joke next to this classic.
5886	1	a	BIG UP, stole 10 years of my life
5888	1	a	This game is one of my all time favorites. 10/10
5890	1	a	THIS GAME WILL REMAIN THE BEST FOREVER! Trust me :D
5892	1	a	i cant find the skins i bought valve why
5894	1	a	Great game for practicing FPS skills
5896	1	a	...
5898	1	a	ABSOLUTLY GOOD GAME! I can jump now 255 CountJump 3 Strafes 100 Sync!  Good game with bugs :F
5900	1	a	Cool game)
5902	1	a	I Love This Game :D Playing Since 2010
5904	1	a	
5906	1	a	Great classic created by good developers, the CS community is still strong today.
5908	1	a	Played with middle aged woman from Yorkshire, UK. Thought I was playing Second Life.
5910	1	a	Best shooting game ever &lt;3
5912	1	a	best Counter Strike out there screw CSS! even with CS:GO i still think Cs.16 is still the best
5914	1	a	Nice game!!!!!!!! 
5916	1	a	So, this game have poor graphics and it's really old, but it still awesome.  This game is based on strategy team work game, that's why i love Counter Strike games.  Yes ... almost all FPS are based on teamwork. But Counter Strike 1.6 is special, you play just for play (no rewards), here you can improve your teamwork to play other games, for example! Or you can simply kill players with no reason... The community have already sent some funny mods for this game and it's currently running in some servers you can join (Zombie Mode, Deathrun, Jailbreak,...). Repetitive? Well it depends on you, if you play all time in the same map in same gamemode, of course is repetitive, but if you make pcw(team/clan war) with your friends in alternated maps, the game will never be repetitive.
5918	1	a	may be old but still fun if ya want to play CS GO with out the items and just play then ya better get this or source its way more worth it . the graphics suck but the gameplay makes up for it
5920	1	a	Awesome GAME ! &lt;3 (y) I LUV THIS GAME &lt;3 THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR !
5922	1	a	I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing love these maps. SV_GRAVITY 0 *yayyyy* Brings back memories but I'm glad I got to play it when it was first released. Definitely unbeatable.
5924	1	a	before switching to CS:GO this was one of the best CS ever :)

5972	1	a	:)
5974	1	a	Quick action game for everyone :)
5976	1	a	I would put this game inside of my mouth, and then i would molest it and love it forever keeping it in my basement for 10 years until finally gaben finds it and returns it to the valve habitat in which i will be sent to prison. In prison i will be spending the majority of my time molesting my pillow dreaming that it is actually counter-strike.
5978	1	a	old,cheap,fun and purely a classic cant go wrong here!
5980	1	a	A real classic. One of the best first person shooters of all time and my favorite game of all time aswell. This game is so good that it will for sure never die! :D 10/10
5982	1	a	SEM IGUAL CS 1.6 !!!
5984	1	a	In my opinion the best of the three parts(i am excluding condition zero because it was not really well known at all.).
5986	1	a	:] 
5988	1	a	this is a very good game  reviewed for steam badge  but really its good
5990	1	a	It 's forever legendary game in my memory
5992	1	a	after a decade of CS CITY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ from beta release to 1.5 to 1.6 to source to CSGO there all AMAAZZZINNNGGGGGG. The 1deag evolves as do we!!!!! CS is what the foundation of steam was even built on... if you own steam and no cs city â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you dono what you got yourself into :D
5994	1	a	i dont know why this game so accdicting
5996	1	a	I put Counter Strike and Battlefield as my two favourite online fps games. Now those two are way too different to say who's better but this is definetly a very fun game that every fan of the franchise needs to try out. The fact that it still has a tone of competitive servers make it still a relevent game and as fun to play as it's ever been. I'd recommend CSGO for higher end machines, but if you're playing on a lower end pc like me this is a must have game
5998	1	a	Hey there! Remember all the good old gaming days? Searching for mix teams, joining up with some random dudes playing all night long? Totally missing some school days here and there? Then you probably, like me, played this game countless of hours.    You know all the default maps better than your first name and have surely tested out thousands of custom maps, hundreds of aim-maps, hundreds of KZ/jumping maps, Warcraft 3 mod (a mod to a game that was a mod, how ironic?), Zombie-mod, gungame mod, evenly and evilly slaughtered all your friends in deathmatch, met thousands of players from all around the world, even from Africa and pwned unimaginable amounts of hardcore and noob-players.    This game will absolutely never die, players will keep trying to find and therefor create new servers and the old PCW/mix-games are still going to be played in the silent even though the competetive gaming scene has gone over to CS:GO. And thank you scene for doing that. This game really needs the cult status in the shadow of newer and more refreshing games. Let it still be there, reminding newer generation of players how the good old times were. Let all the videos be there on youtube especially of the bigger contests. It makes me happy.   So, what is this game all about?  Well, it is simple. The main theme of the game is either 'bomb-planting terrorists vs bomb-defusing counter-terrorists', 'hostage-rescue-mode' or 'save the VIP-mode'. A competetive first person shooter game that has immersive action-packed gameplay all over your screen. You will most likely be flashed, smoked out, shot from far away by a sniper, spawnkilled by your sister, knifed by your brother, exploded by either a bomb or a thrown HE-granade or camped to death by a noob. Sounds good? Then join in the action! You are not just late, you are very late!
6000	1	a	pLay On DuReX
6002	1	a	This is the game that started it all for me. When it was a mod for Half Life and Steam didn't exist, those were the days. Since then the Counter-Strike franchise has only expanded and has only increased its esports realm. The original counter-strike may lack in graphics for today's standards however for its time it was awesome.  I enjoyed AS_ maps like oilrig, arctic, and various other maps that are no longer in the 'mainstream cs:go scene'.  10/10 - Sometimes I play this to remember the good times. I wouldn't pay more than $2.50 for this game, or buy the Valve Complete Bundle to get this great game and more great Valve exclusives.
6004	1	a	'old school' game. She is beautiful, but time has passed 
6006	1	a	I have been playing Counter-Strike for 10 years and never got bored, best game ever !
6008	1	a	One of the best FPS games in history. Its one of a kind. Easy to run and fun to play.
6010	1	a	4/5
6012	1	a	5/5
6014	1	a	Till date, the best shooting game ever made.
6016	1	a	.....cs is life.....cs is every thing.....
6018	1	a	Best FPS Game ever. I fart everytime i play it.
6020	1	a	This game is like male genitalia. It starts off soft, then as you progress through multiplayer experience. You soon realize that your soft genitalia becomes hard. Then there are the people who use AWPs, and Para. Those people have permanent small genitalia.   Don't have small genitalia.  By the way, you made have heard this game refered as 'Headshot Simulator'   1 Genitalia/0 Genitalia
6022	1	a	This games is an epic one ! It makes you either the perfect Terrorist for Osama Bin Laden , either the perfect Anti-Terrorist for missies Barack Obama !!   I played so much as a Terrorist , that I can kill both Bin Laden and Obama in the same day.   09.11.2001 / 10
6024	1	a	I'm really bad at this game but people seem to like it. I think I paid like $5 for it.
6026	1	a	started in 1999 still people love it and play it a must game for every FPS player
6028	1	a	Why are you here reading this review? There are bombs to defuse, hostages to rescue and noobs to headshot with an AWP through the double doors on de_dust2.  I don't care if it's old. I don't care if there's CS:S or CS:GO. Play a round of this and get your 'nads handed to you by angry Germans with an AK-47. Play 4564 more rounds and you *might* hand their 'nads to them instead. Intense multiplayer shooting at it's finest and crudest. Not for the faint of heart.
6030	1	a	I didn't even play this game when I first reviewed it what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ why did I review this  Counter-Strike. If you don't know what this game is, you should probably slap yourself and stop playing games because this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ literally founded multiplayer first-person shooters.  Okay, not 'founded', Quake did that first but it sure as hell helped them develop into what they are today.  While the graphics definitely haven't held up to standards today (kind of obvious since this game was released in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING 2000 AND STARTED DEVELOPMENT IN 1999), this game is still fun. Why? There's a lot more maps in the game, and as a result of low graphical quality, it's a LOT easier to run on old systems or just bad systems in general. And the gameplay is still just as fun as CS:S or even CS:GO.  This game used to still be the 3rd most played game on Steam next to Team Fortress 2 (  ) and Dota 2, but that changed when CS:GO actually started to become a good game back in 2013. Now there's really only the most dedicated CS players that play this game.  I don't recommend going into this game unless you're a dedicated CS veteran who wants to relive the history of CS and see what the first game got everyone hyped for. This game's great, I'm not going to lie, it's just the learning curve as of right now is STEEP. And that can be good or bad for some people.  I'm definitely going to be spending more time in this game in the future just so I can get hours in the game and act like I'm actually good at Counter-Strike for once. That's about it, though.

6054	1	a	You can not describe this game, simply the best FPS EVER! AMAZING !
6056	1	a	CS:S is better, this is MUCH more complicated (i.e. you have to buy ammo after you buy the gun)
6058	1	a	This game is probably the best game on steam. 10/10, Absolutely awesome.
6060	1	a	Let me just get my Windows 98 up and my dial up ready so we can play with the new 3DFX card better than software rendering
6062	1	a	Even though its a pretty old game, its still fun as hell!
6064	1	a	There's simply no game like cs1.6.
6066	1	a	Do i really have to review this game?
6068	1	a	Ahh CS...For many of us born in the 90s, this game took our FPS virginity...Writing a negative review about this game is like writing a negative review about sex...I'm sorry if you had such a tragic experience...
6070	1	a	a Good Game ... Best game 4ever

6094	1	a	.

6284	1	a	the game is the best thing out there with low graphics .

6290	1	a	Same opinion now that i've bought them all again. Counter Strike is legendary.
6292	1	a	Best classic game ever, for sure.
6294	1	a	Nice to play .
6296	1	a	I will own old hardware in 2040 to play this game. 11/10
6298	1	a	to valve  the game cs 1.6 have a glitch  the glitch is a network glitch  if i am come to server its fail to insert the server  fix it.
6300	1	a	CS 1.6 is my fav CS of all time CSGO is gaining in popularity everyday but i wish people would start playing 1.6 more
6302	1	a	First game where I was addicted as a kid. Great gameplay and a lot of mods give me Thousands hourse of gameplay. Since I was a kid and didnt know much about steam I played this non-steam and even now after I have newest games to play I just buy it cause of sympathy. If you ever play this game non-steam or just looking for very good shoter similar to CS: GO this game is for You.  I totally suggests you to buy this beauty game
6304	1	a	It reminds me the great old times when i used to play it with my friends.
6306	1	a	10/10 Would fire in the hole again.   Game on my friends!
6308	1	a	PLAYED THIS GAME ALL MY LIFE WHAT I GAVED TO IT: -my hart -passion -time -7.99$ WHAT CS GAVED TO ME: -broken keyboard -3 broken keyboards to be exact -2 broken mouses -1 broken monitor -my vegirnity -eye cancer -0.00$ AND IT GEAVED ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING: -respect of my friends for the best hacker in the world GG GABEN 420/Blazeit
6310	1	a	It's a classic. played it for hours back in the day when steam was born ^^ don't buy the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cs:go, this is the game form guys, cs:go is just for the kids.
6312	1	a	It's a very nice game, and it's one of the clasics, a pure gold mine.
6314	1	a	Best game ever in PC games history, love yo play !!!
6316	1	a	Old but gold! ;)
6318	1	a	.
6320	1	a	the first computer based fps game I ever played. Still one the best, if not the best fps of all time.
6322	1	a	Classic, though I'd reconmend one of its newer conterparts at this point in time.
6324	1	a	I like this game ;)
6326	1	a	Best FPS ever, no other fps comes close to the amazing movement and gunplay in cs1.6 high skill ceiling and very rewarding gameplay
344	0	a	Get every single cheater off of this game. Permanently. VAC isn't doing it's job well at all. Many cheaters roam in this game. It needs to stop. Cheaters, if you're reading this (which you proberably are), you are a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6328	1	a	This is my first game review, and I am glad it is a good one. Personally, my favorite feature about this game is you don't have to play online all the time. You can easily play a campaign mode game against CPUs, which is not all that bad. The gameplay is great along with the graphics and a good weapon selection. The only thing I would say that is bad about it is it can be hard to find a multiplayer server to play on.    9/10
6330	1	a	Great
6332	1	a	-Open game -Activate your cfg -Find a server -And 'b 4 3 b 1 4' if u r ct -If u t 'b 4 2 b 1 4' -GO! GO! GO!    After 3 seconds   Me : U hacker. Someone : hahaha noob Hacker : O Hockor hohoohoh noob Me : /admin Admin : He is not hacker Me : U know what ? u guys are S*ck. All of u. Did u hear me? N*gga ! Me : And i'm not racist.  And i'm banned.
6334	1	a	its good
6336	1	a	Still one of the best FPS.
6338	1	a	Counter r0x Âº-Âº
6340	1	a	great game
6342	1	a	Accidently discovered this game when I played half life in the early 2000's. A few years later started playing lan with my friends and I've never stopped playing since then. CSGO will never replace the beauty and classiness of 1.6.
6344	1	a	LIFE IS 1 BUT CS 1.6
6346	1	a	It's certainly a harder version of CS:GO and since it still does have servers/ESEA support, if you wanna try it, buy it. For the price, certainyl a good and enjoyable game
6348	1	a	This is a Good Game!! The Weapons- Good The players- Very Good 
6350	1	a	It's good game and always will be.
6352	1	a	This game is no working!!! And is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i need my money back !
6354	1	a	its cs
6356	1	a	!!!
6358	1	a	the best game
6360	1	a	awesome game which was which will be evergreen  #RESPECT for those who created this game
6362	1	a	Best cs game of history
6364	1	a	This game is very good despite it being so old, but hey, you know what they say...old is gold.
6366	1	a	NO IRL MONEY KNIVES 10/10
6368	1	a	Beast.  5/7
6370	1	a	Good history &lt;3
6372	1	a	Best game you will ever play.
6374	1	a	The Best Game On The World!!! :P
6376	1	a	10/10 Better than csgo
6378	1	a	I have not played cs 1.6 for many years. I realized that really missed it.I did not download it from steam at that years. But now , I downloaded it from here and I saw that there is no bot packs in the game. Is there anyone who knows how can I find a bot pack for cs 1.6 steam version?
6380	1	a	It's awesome :D
6382	1	a	What can i say about this game, works fine, a lot of players are still playing this game because its really addicting and enjoyable!
6384	1	a	ItÂ¨s one of the most played fps games ever,  With Gungame, kreedz, deathmatch, Jailbreak, hide n seek.. and much much more! If you consider buying it, i think you really should! :) Good luck, have fun, gamers :)
6386	1	a	Good ! Very Good ! Excellent !    OW JUST BUT IT ALRADY!
6388	1	a	good game ! action !
6390	1	a	+
6392	1	a	Second version of counter-strike i tried, and this is one of the best versions as far as I know. If you are reading this now, you should try out the new version of counter-strike instead, CSGO!  Counter-strike 1.6 was the best, now its old and outdated.
6394	1	a	its nice
6396	1	a	Fun and original, still played by proffesionals today
6398	1	a	222
6400	1	a	One of the best games!
6402	1	a	:)
6404	1	a	Hello ! I was banned on account of steam Counter Strike 1.6. I have absolutely no cheats used. What can I do ?
6406	1	a	Fun to play when CS:GO is full of hackers.
6408	1	a	Would still play 2016.
6410	1	a	Why I didnÂ´t buy this game earlier :( I played for 1500 hours non-steam :(  Fantastic Game 10/10 -
6412	1	a	+
6414	1	a	The best game in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ever
6416	1	a	!!!
6418	1	a	Very good game, but now outdated. Gamers good luck have fun Move on to CS GO

6448	1	a	hello this game is too good &lt;3 :D
6450	1	a	Best old shooter game ,)
6452	1	a	One Of the BEST Multi-Player game.Have every kind of MOD giving a special touch in it Strongly Recommended and Its CHEAP as well :P
6454	1	a	Ok, so i have been playing counter strike since i knew of my self, i would give strong recommendation for this version of the game if it wasn't so spoiled with cheaters, the game in 'the days' rocked!
6456	1	a	 A must. If you don't have it, buy it. Test it. Play it. Master it, and love it.
347	0	a	wtf happened to the fps? did they put a limit on it?
6458	1	a	Time to get off garrys mod or CS:GO and look at this sexy beast.  Play it and love it. CREATE BOSS SERVERS. NO NOOBS (WELL THERE I) JUST SWAGNESS IT COST MONEY BUT GOOD
6460	1	a	The best game in the world.
6462	1	a	I love this game I always have and always will
6464	1	a	best cs ever!!!!!!!!!
6466	1	a	One of the best FPS ever made, it's still so popular despite it's 12 years old now. What I love in CS is that your skill is much more important than in other games (such as Call of Money), which is even more rewarding when you kill a lot of people in a row , that means you're a good player (at least on the current server) ! I have to admit that its graphics are bad but hey, that's not what makes a great game ! Anyway, they can be improved by using nicer models or detailed textures.
6468	1	a	I rememeber first getting my Xbox. I was about like 5 and my brothers would be playing games and I would play with them. We would play Sonic Adevntures, House of the Dead, and Counter Strike. All classics. I have loved Counter Strike ever since this time. And playing this CSGO, CSS, and CSCZ is amazing. It reminds we of the greatest times of my early childhood. Counter Strike is an amazing game and expirience. Counter Strike is the one game that all humans should have the right to at least play. This is in my top 5 games of all time.
6470	1	a	So while I haven't played this game long. It taught me one things: Graphics don't mean â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6472	1	a	10/10 Best game in the world xD
6474	1	a	Good game for its time. Don't play it much anymore.
6476	1	a	this a vere good game
6478	1	a	Great classic
6480	1	a	Old but gold!
6482	1	a	I love this game! &lt;3
6484	1	a	I know I haven't played much of this game...  but that is because i have been playing too much cs:go  10/10, would waste my life again!
6486	1	a	One of if not the best game of all time for me ... Been playing since the release... awesome game, so much fun
350	0	a	can't play with bot :'(
6488	1	a	!!
6490	1	a	what makes cs good for me is the flexibility of the players, wallbangs
6492	1	a	good game, but dont buy it cuz csgo is better + there are lots of wallhackers on this game so just buy CS:GO
6494	1	a	On my old steam acconut over 2500+ Hours..memories,  Signed by  PGL/Oldheaven
6496	1	a	my favorit game ever! great teams, and weapons
6498	1	a	The one and only.
6500	1	a	Hello counter strike owners i played your game long time ago and one hacker cracked my player and used cheats on my account and made you ban vack me please what i need to do to you remove my ban vack its been a lot of time and i realy miss your cool game :(
6502	1	a	this game rulz
6504	1	a	My favorite FPS shooter, I think I will never stop zooming because aim is not for me at all =] p.s I'm awper...
6506	1	a	classic fps 10/10
6508	1	a	Joined Steam only For Counter Strike &lt;3
6510	1	a	4444
6512	1	a	Best of all time.
6514	1	a	Remind the old days..
6516	1	a	In this game I'm playing ''non-steam'' 5k hours, and I must say that the more experiences seriously at the rear oldschool games had. Imitation weapons super! At that it was still graphics for games and better graphics are great! Maps on other versions are better yes but punching through a wall on dust2 boring. Bhopâ™¥ BEST,surf was heavier than on other versions yes but I managed it just ... cool game! dont plz rate my english.  Peace, Onii
6518	1	a	its a very grate game but i cant add bots can somone send me a message on how to add bots i will be very happy if you can send ma a message over how to instal bots. overall its a good game and its the only game on my libary that runs on 60 fps
6520	1	a	Old, but awesome
6522	1	a	:)
6524	1	a	Where it all began &lt;3 !!!
6526	1	a	Propably mother of most tactic-FPS games, classic and perfect at the same time, includes alot of fun moments and makes players want to sharpen their skills.    The game that teaches us that you run faster with the knife .   For some reason scout sniper rifle appears to be the lighter than knife. Doh.
6528	1	a	Pretty Interesting game to say the least.
6530	1	a	Finnaly returning to the clasic, best game for 10 years, I would love to see the game returning in main scene, but seems it is not possible Anyways 2010 9/10 2016 10/10 Old but gold
6532	1	a	.
6534	1	a	Good old times :S

6540	1	a	kind game you need to teach your sons dope
351	0	a	In its day, CS 1.6 was the shining example of a multiplayer FPS experience. It was just one of those games that, if you didn't own it, you were just statistically worse than everyone else. Oh, how the might have fallen. Nowadays, the game is plagued with a general lack of interest, as most of its fans have moved on to its vastly superior brothers, CSS and CSGO, and for good reason.  I would recommend playersonly play on servers they trust. This is because apparently one server overwrote all of my unused keys to connect to 'xdd.ms-shadow.ro:27015', which is also a server i would recommend avoiding at all costs.  This game is a relic, a fossil from an age of gaming long past.
6542	1	a	It will never get old :D
352	0	a	the game removed on steam I would be happy if you can return it to me thanks
6544	1	a	Belongs in your library. Once in a while, take it out, dust it off, and remember how we got to where we are now.
6546	1	a	I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.
6548	1	a	plant the bomb and get to tha choppaaaah
6550	1	a	one of the best game i ever played, i hope csgo will ever be that fun as cs1.6 was ..
6552	1	a	I own a lot of games on steam now, but this was my first ever purchase. From 1.1, to bunny hop in 1.3, to the lovely 1.5 then 1.6, I have spent thousands of hours on this game. Worked my spray kills in Cal-O up-to hack-like headshots in Cal-P. I could have done so much more with my time in high school, but this game probably saved my life, virginity, and from weed.. (actually that last part is a lie)   I'm redownloading this as I speak so I can alt-f4 when I get killed and claim it was a hacker, only to restart the game seconds later cuz wtf else am I gonna play.
6554	1	a	Nice game for a pleyers is play fer....
6556	1	a	world's best game ever
6558	1	a	10/10
6560	1	a	10/10
6562	1	a	Nostalgic, Classic, The Best, Legend
6564	1	a	Good Old Game, When I play this game let me remember my little past.
6566	1	a	just buy the game.
6568	1	a	The game is perfectly designed and its graphics is incredible. The Counter Strike 1.6 game is specifically designed to offer shear fun and excitement for all young and old generation as well. The game tactics cannot be judged at ease as the targets and tasks change as per the assigned map location inside the game. In this game, the real challenges are like exploiting the opposition, diffusing the bomb, killing enemy with mere knife as a weapon and rescuing the hostages which are trapped at the weird locations. All in all, the tasks assigned in this game are never achievable in a time span of 5 minutes.  In some map of this game, the task is to win the round within 90 seconds which is quite impossible if you are playing the expert level. Also some of the team members don't follow your commands during the game which adds more delay in achieving the tasks. In such situations one has to have the accurate skills to win this game. So it is obvious that this game will take near about 2 months time to complete all the four modes like easy, normal, hard and expert. But if you love this game, and there is proper audio settings present at your machine, then there is no stopping and all modes of this game can be completed within few days or may be in few hours of time. Now in terms of speculation, it is seen that parents worry about their child playing offensive games and counter strike 1.6 is no excuse to this scenario. So children's should keep in mind that playing such games is for fun and they must themselves have control over the time which they devote towards this popular and addictive game.   The game is full of action and I feel that one who plays a counter strike game can perform the tasks like studying and other home related duties at a greater pace. But it is necessary that the gamers spend a lot of time on studying since balance between games and study has to be maintained at any cost. So the students who play this game should take care of home duties and study at first. At last if they find time, they have to invest it while playing this incredible game.
6570	1	a	The most important multiplayer game of the millenium!
6572	1	a	Its csgo but without skins and worse texures. At least it has the Mp5

6600	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6602	1	a	Counter-strike is more than a game, it's a culture in itself. Easily the best competitive FPS out there. You gotta aim bruh.
6604	1	a	this is still the best CS version.
6606	1	a	Its very good please play it its better then cs go!!
6608	1	a	The best FPS game in the history for a reason. The game is 15-16 years old, but still peoples playing it. I played really really lot with this game, when i was younger. Thousands of hours. 
6610	1	a	This game is old as dirt, yet I still like it.  10/10 better than Counter-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥: Global Trash
6612	1	a	Great Choice! This game is excellent when you install bots in your game. To me personally, I love the graphics more than the newer counter strike games.
6614	1	a	:)
6616	1	a	hourboosting this game so people think im not cheating in csgo

6632	1	a	best childhood game
6634	1	a	Just the legend
6636	1	a	i recommend this for those real hard core gamers of late 90's , if u think this game is bad , look at the mirror.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfZBaMKwCMk   dont get fooled, what u get is 5-15 ms delay compared to 500-3000ms on other games.
6638	1	a	Remains an old classic. The mechanics of the movement in this game is simply art. The way that you can gain boost by using a simple technique called 'bhoppin' aka 'bunnyhopping' is just overwhelming amazing. The graphics brings you straight back to the childhood, sitting there jumping around with your Desert-Eagle and AK-47. As said, an old classic, a must have game,  As the old 1.6 player I am, I am proud to say that if you havent played 1.6 you havent played cs. Simple as that.  Go play it until your fingers hurt of 'bhoppin' and spraying.
6640	1	a	NNNIce Game #!23
6642	1	a	Classic Game, where CS began!
6644	1	a	10/10 Because this game never gats old, its still interesting after 17 years... Audio 10/10 Graphics( at that time ) 10/10 Community 10/10 Matchmaking 8/10  It was created in 1999... Still best First person multiplayer shooters of all time!

6694	1	a	Long time player. fun game to play
6696	1	a	finally no more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s
6698	1	a	best game of the world â™¥ nunca serÃ£o
6700	1	a	Only the best game ever
6702	1	a	Sometimes I come back to this game just because it is too good to not forget :D
6704	1	a	counter-strike 1.6 is my favorite game i first on played shooter game wheen i start playing shooter game &lt;3
6706	1	a	The best Counter-Strike that has ever existed.
6708	1	a	really good game can be played for hours the nostalgia is real with this one
6710	1	a	My very first game on Steam. Never gets old, 10/10.
6712	1	a	10/10
6714	1	a	  One of my favorite game.
6716	1	a	Old but perfect ;)
6718	1	a	never gets old still on the first game to be played by any gamer in his life .
6720	1	a	I can speak spanish and portuguese fluently after playing on NA servers.
6722	1	a	A classic FPS which I spent more than my whole lifetime on non-steam version. Still the game can be played, the servers are full most of the time.  10/10 would make a rebirth of this game 
6724	1	a	Very good skilled based game!
6726	1	a	Where can I start...this is one of the most iconic games on Steam. Even though it came out a while ago and the graphics are horrible, the game is incredibly fun. Very old school and will take you back to when gaming was starting to flourish.
6728	1	a	Can't run CSGO? Get this! Unfortunately the FOV looks really low when on 16:9 resolutions, and a lot of the servers are spanish. Still fun though. And you can't waste your money on skins in this one!
6730	1	a	!
6732	1	a	Just one problem, every unmapped button makes you join another server for some reason,  
6734	1	a	The best game! = )
6736	1	a	The dead wish is come to cs 1.6 :p
6738	1	a	Without a doubt the best counter-strike tied with source.
6740	1	a	I buyed the game and i dont have lol
6742	1	a	It's ok.
6744	1	a	Best first person shooter game ever.
6746	1	a	My favourite game :D &lt;3
6748	1	a	Great game, so much history behind it.
6750	1	a	  Good game ! Nice work ! The best game
6752	1	a	Old but gold.
6754	1	a	The best Game forever
6756	1	a	I've player CS:GO for a while and also CSS for a couple of years and by far CS 1.6 is the best.
6758	1	a	Classic, only beaten by the new CS:GO, and still have a good player base, even after all these years.
6760	1	a	This game is legendary. This started back in 1999 and haven't got lost the pleasure of playing it. The graphics are not the best, it's an old game, but it's FUN! That was the point of the game! It's one of the best first person shooter in the world, it's not me saying that, all over the world people consider Counter Strike 1.6 one of the best shooter games. And it had lans and big event until CS:GO showed up in 2012. It's still played by LOTS of people. 17 years old and still rocks!!
6762	1	a	  I dont speak English but this game so awesome for me becouse I am hikka
6764	1	a	......
6766	1	a	  Nice Game And Famous
6768	1	a	timeless classic
6770	1	a	I could only connect to Spanish speaking servers. Lag is bad. Disconnect is often. But there are no Russians. No â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? 10/10
6772	1	a	Play every single game out there,  Eventually u will go back to CS 1.6
6774	1	a	even though steam says i only have 36 hours. It's more like I have spent 36months in game. This game is the reason I got a steam account back in 2006.
6776	1	a	Still the best game :)
6778	1	a	Probably the best oldschool game ever. I play it after 1 year pause again.
6780	1	a	My #1 favorite action game! I love how the game looks! The community is fun, and so many servers to join! I enjoy the experience! The games is just so amazing! I highly recommend playing Counter-Strike! Trust me, its fun!
6782	1	a	One of the best fps games made .

6822	1	a	Best game in the wolrd !
6824	1	a	counter strike 1.6 aka nostalgia strike 1.6  since this is a classic i would probably get ddosed, hacked and many other horrible things done to me if i were to talk badly upon this magical game  ------------- Le Good stuf -good old maps (dust2, vertigo etc.) -the riot shield (im probably the only person who likes the riot shield) -night vision (good for camping in dark spots with an awp while eating doritos you fat russian) -actual sprays (not the BS that you have to pay for in csgo) ------------- Le bad Stuf  -no bots  though this can be easily fixed through Zbots, just google it up and it shouldnt be too hard to get working  in the end i give this a 9/10 really good game, not too shabby graphics, and a fun waste of time if your bored 
6826	1	a	old but gold amirite?
6828	1	a	This my best game ever :)
6830	1	a	Although the community is dead and probably will never come back to its previous state,it is worth buying the game as buying cs 1.6 will allow you to try to master a harder version of cs(although deagle is easier to use).trust you will meet great people while playing this game i played on a server called pga although there are hackers they are usually banned by admins in a day or 2 and playing 1.6 is like a fresh experience.you may ask how i know this,it was how i felt when i bought go in 2012 in this account
6832	1	a	my life :D &lt;3
6834	1	a	10/10
6836	1	a	Regardless of the release date it's one of the best games I've played 10/10.
6838	1	a	The Holy Grail of all online shooters.
6840	1	a	The best version of CS. Thank you valve that your maked this game ;)
6842	1	a	This is my best game
6844	1	a	This game is way better than CS:GO.
6846	1	a	So many memories...

6938	1	a	You arent a gamer if you never played it.
6940	1	a	One of the best online shooters ever. Very few shooters did what cs pulled off. Cs managed to cater to pretty much every player whether you played comp, pub or were a casual player like me, cs did it all. Comp players had one of the best games to compete in, pub players had a great 24-32 player experience, and casual players like me had as_crazytank and mod servers.   Shout out to anyone who played on the daves custom funmaps server back in 04-05 :) 
6942	1	a	everyone should buy it, a fantastic game!
6944	1	a	Good and old game . :D
6946	1	a	  Still the best game i ever played.

6976	1	a	  The CS1.6 is the successor to Thiel's CS1.5, a denizen of this magazine's 'Recommended Components' listing ever since Sam Tellig enthused over it in August 1994. (He also wrote about it in May '96, while Muse Kastanovich's November '95 review included a full set of measurements.) Like the '1.5, the '1.6 is a floorstanding two-way design with a sloped-back front baffle. That's where the resemblance ends, however, as every other aspect of the 2002 speaker's design is new.  Whereas the CS1.5's baffle was flat, with step-backs for the hefty grille, the '1.6's is elegantly sculpted with a CNC machine to optimize dispersion, the minimal grille fitting into a shallow depression and held with concealed magnets. With the grille removed, the most obvious visible feature is a long vertical slot beneath the woofer, surrounded by a machined flare. This slot acts as the reflex port, but its geometry is claimed to minimize wind noise and any modification of its tuning by the grille.  The 6.5' woofer, designed and manufactured in-house, uses a 3' voice-coil to drive the metal cone closer to its perimeter than usual. This is said to increase the stiffness of the cone, pushing the inevitable breakup modes much higher in frequency than with a conventional cone and voice-coil. The large coil allows the neodymium magnet to be housed completely within the voice-coil former, inherently shielding the magnet. The 1' tweeter uses a metal dome and, like the woofer, features a short coil with a copper distortion-reducing ring, operating in a long gap. The tweeter dome is recessed slightly in a front plate with a short flare, which will increase its on-axis sensitivity to match the efficient woofer, at the expense of restricting the unit's dispersion in the top octave.  The crossover is, as is usual in Thiel's Coherent Source designs, a phase-optimal first-order type. This and the sloping back baffle allow the sounds from both drivers to arrive at the listener's ears at the same time. In a welcome departure from earlier Thiel speakers, the CS1.6's sturdy terminal posts are sited on the rear of its cabinet rather than the base.  Sound  Setting up the CS1.6s involved finding positions for them that gave the optimum balance among four nonrelated aspects of sound quality. The speaker's bass region is intrinsically shelved-down. However, moving the speakers close to the sidewalls to give some boundary reinforcement of the low frequencies also emphasized some residual hardness in the low treble, and resulted in a balance that was too bright with the speakers facing straight ahead. Moving the speakers well away from the sidewalls gave a sound that was clean and clear, but with insufficient bass. Keeping the speakers where they had the most extended bass but toeing them in so that they faced the listening seat reduced the hardness, added some useful top-octave air, and gave a soundstage that was superbly detailed and stable. On the downside, the overall sound was still a little bright for my tastes and system.  Ultimately, I moved each speaker forward along the line joining its acoustic center to the listening position, noting how the drop in bass weight was balanced by a corresponding drop in low-treble hardness. This sounds more straightforward than it was because the CS1.6's overall sound changed more during the break-in process than I am used to. Thiel recommends 50 hours 'at moderately loud levels,' but at the end of the month during which I used the Thiels for my everyday listening, I was still not sure that they'd reached equilibrium.  But what had begun as brightness had been transformed into superb resolution of detail. What had started out as a lightweight, not too well-defined low-frequency register ended up as a balance that worked well on such superb double-bass recordings as Edgar Meyer's new disc of concertos, by himself and Bottesini, with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra (Sony Classical SK 60956). Meyer's Concerto in D starts with some E-string grumbling and portamento slides, all rendered perfectly clearly on the CS1.6s, without any boom obscuring the instrument's pitch.

7184	1	a	10 years of playing this game, and I come here now to review it. Thank you Steam awards to show me my inconsiderate self. XXXO
7186	1	a	One of the best old-school games out there.
7188	1	a	Best shooter game of all time!
7190	1	a	The only thing Valve didnt destroyed
7192	1	a	This game is just a good game overall i like this game a little bit more than CSGO right now since its a classic, and it's really easy to pickup and play and practise for csgo since they are the same game basically
7194	1	a	15 plus years and this game still holds up as well as the day it came out.
7196	1	a	10/10
7198	1	a	bring me back to the 90s!
7200	1	a	Still better than Halo.
7202	1	a	CS is truly one of those rare games that defines a generation. As an FPS, its mechanics still hold pattern with modern technological marvels, and it is doubtful that a single game will ever have the same effect on the culture of gaming as a whole to the same extent as this masterpiece.
7204	1	a	Right in the childhood
7206	1	a	Best classical game ever.
7208	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6 was the very first CS game that I'v played. Me and my friends used to bring flash sticks to the computer room in our high school and started a mini tournament.
7210	1	a	This game is bae
7212	1	a	love it &lt;3
7214	1	a	all timegreat counter strike game...its been taken over by cs:go but still can play this to remind yourself of old times ;D
7216	1	a	the grandpa or go. 10/10 would not update this anymore.
7218	1	a	Old but gold
7220	1	a	  You're not a true gamer, unless you have this game.
7222	1	a	gg izi im golbal on minecraft this is ez

7230	1	a	responsible for making and destroying my life 10/10 would play again

7238	1	a	10/10
7240	1	a	Amazing. I love this game even more than CSGO at this point. It feels amazing to play and is pretty fun to wallbang.
7242	1	a	It is historical

7286	1	a	One of the best games in the world !
7288	1	a	100/10 *
7290	1	a	full of kiwi's
7292	1	a	Great :)
7294	1	a	Simply full of nostalgia xD
7296	1	a	this game is a classic! great normal multiplayer, and even better custom games with an almost unlimited number of different formats to customize it.
7298	1	a	Nice Game!
7300	1	a	GOTTA PLAY. May seem old, BUT CLASSIC. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
7302	1	a	I never played a better first person shooter.
7304	1	a	It's a good game
7306	1	a	Nice game , bra ! &lt;3
7308	1	a	The better version of CS compared to Source  Rating 8.5/10 
7310	1	a	Its is a lot better than non steam .. don't lag
7312	1	a	Simply the Best!
7314	1	a	For many, the original Counter-Strike remains the definitive online shooter. Tens of thousands hop onto servers every day to continue the eternal battle between terrorists and counter-terrorists. CS is an almost perfectly balanced mix of teamwork and individual skill with enough depth and nuance to inspire countless esports competitions. Valve have attempted to improve on the formula with Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but the original remains the go-to choice for online action gamers with top twitch skills.
7316	1	a	upgraded to mac os x 10.9 and it broke it.. the mouse dsnt work anymore. ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling :(
7318	1	a	Nice game! Addictive as hell and you never will be tired playing this awesome game!
7320	1	a	4th world graphics with a free spririted romp through illustrious landscapes makes this game a thumb that's shaking around and about to fall off after being shot with a glock so it's still there but it hurts so good
7322	1	a	I played this game back in 1.5 before shields and before VAC before steam had the GUI overlay. I'm a OG CS'er. Had alot of fun scriming using MirC, CAL Leagues, CEVO. Retired team aG and clan SKj. I blame this game for getting me into a computer profession. haha
7324	1	a	Cool game ;3
7326	1	a	Great gameplay. First played during Counter-Strike 1.4, was awesome then, still awesome now. Highly reccomended. The Counter-Strike series is fantastic.
7328	1	a	^^
7330	1	a	Greatest game ever
7332	1	a	:)
7334	1	a	No life ;)
7336	1	a	Classic FPS after Quake and Half-Life. This was the game that brought PC gaming to mainstream light (Behind Starcraft). Professional tournaments sponsored by large tech companies was the tip of the iceberg. Strong community-ran servers proved to be invaluable when considering how easy it was to find a place to play without hackers.  Purest First Person Shooter game I have ever played.
7338	1	a	best cs ever
7340	1	a	this game was unusual of its kind. Now its has its era gone, don't know why. Its an awsum game, i am quite unhappy for it as its been officially removed from e-sports gaming. Its a must play online game.
7342	1	a	Good ol' school CS 1.6
7344	1	a	A verry good and old game . Actually is verry populated , considering the age .
7346	1	a	Is a nice game !
7348	1	a	Best game on Steam Store!
7350	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 is a wicked fps Multiplayer game to play on. very much fun. played this when i was a young kid. and well still do at this day now :) very great game! one of the best pc games if i must say. :)
7352	1	a	Try Badges :P
7354	1	a	The good game,in my life!
7356	1	a	Nice Game nd Time spender game i loved also

7364	1	a	Best Multiplayer Game ever played!

7368	1	a	get it tons of fun
7370	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7372	1	a	CS 1.6 For Life :-)
7374	1	a	Best game ever, ever. Destroyed by hackers(cheaters).
7376	1	a	great game..
7378	1	a	This is my very first game that I played on Steam, Counter-Strike. This game brings back good memories. Very addicting. It's probably the only game that people are playing today on that isn't running off from a source engine. If you never played Counter-Strike 1.6 before, try it out. It's one of the best FPS game of all time. If you don't like it, well, you didn't paid alot of money for it.......or did you?
7380	1	a	The Best Multiplayer FPS Game Ever Made.
7382	1	a	Old but gold.
7384	1	a	This is game caused the revolution of FPS games so it gets 5 out of 5 but be warned if you are not MLG you will be mocked and called a noob.
7386	1	a	Nice game :D
7388	1	a	The best Game !
7390	1	a	Have Low RAM? Have No Graphic Card? Care Only For Gameplays? Want a First Person Shooter?? Well Sir This Is The Best Game You Can Run On Slow PCs
7392	1	a	game of the century
7394	1	a	Still Awesome!
7396	1	a	Oldschool, but still awesome, although there are some cheaters. I suggest to buy this game if you haven't, don't be a pirate :D
7398	1	a	I love counterstriker
7400	1	a	best game in the world
7402	1	a	ok game but not good HD GRapics
7404	1	a	Awesome game for a multiplayer experience where you are competing with several other skilled players. Really awesome.
7406	1	a	old but still a nice game... I miss the old days when you could wallbang :p
7408	1	a	A very goob game that lasts for years and years. Keep on the good work.
7410	1	a	:)
7412	1	a	:)
7414	1	a	I miss the countless nights we'd play this together, Chris.
7416	1	a	Cool Game
7418	1	a	awesome  play from long time but always seems new new new
7420	1	a	very nice game.. :) 
7422	1	a	On the correct server .. still the best raw FPS game Deathmatch !
7424	1	a	the original cs
7426	1	a	Best MP of all times!
7428	1	a	Very addictive game
7430	1	a	This game really proves that graphic does not matter but gameplay does...cs 1.6 &lt;3
7432	1	a	The classic. The original. The first and last of its kind. The beginning of a legacy. Or just hours upon hours of time wasted while your brain controversially shouts to you 'Just one more round!'  The excitement of a firefight is a standard of most First-Person Shooters but Counter-Strike is different. The game tries to focus on communication and teamwork coincided with skilled aim and complex maneuvers rather than just free-for-all deathmatch game. Failure to comply with the games train of thought winds you up in the lovely thing we gamers call 'Spectator Mode.' Gotta love that! Although becoming proficient at the game will take a lot longer than most games it is worth the time put into it!   Gamers that are looking for a game that requires teamwork, skill, time, practice, and communication will not be disappointed!  Presentation: 8/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 5/10  Sound: 6.5/10 Difficulty: 8/10 Lasting Appeal: 10/10  Overall Rating: 8.5/10
7434	1	a	better than the original!
7436	1	a	the best game ever ....
7438	1	a	The best fps game in the world.
7440	1	a	Wasted tons of my time. 10/10.
7442	1	a	Best FPS in history. Enough said.
7444	1	a	really fun competetive gameplay
7446	1	a	What's good it's good and it's the best !
7448	1	a	I am not a Pro But yea 10 years ago i bought it and I &lt;3 d it so much , I still do
7450	1	a	good game but old :-(
7452	1	a	Original game will always be number 1 !! before cod and after cod ! 100/100

7462	1	a	:)
7464	1	a	Hi, I have a problem with the game counter strike 1.6 st ofcourse, what happens is that when I'm playing I get problem connecting
7466	1	a	In past: 10/10 Now: 10/10 Future: 10/10
7468	1	a	What can you say? The best FPS game out there, even to this day.
7470	1	a	GG game, always love
7472	1	a	Was good while it lasted but CS GO is taking over!!!
7474	1	a	Best Game Ever And this Game Proves Graphics Doesn't Matter!&lt;3
7476	1	a	!
7478	1	a	i play dis game for about what? 6 years? well yes i do, and i absoltely love it. its amazing, it doenst have singleplayer but the multiplayer is what keeps me here. i can play the same map over and over again, but it will be still fun because ur playing with friends or playing with different guns or strategis, thats what makes it amazing
7480	1	a	Just nothing to say, than thank you.
7482	1	a	One Of The Favourite Games Of My Life .. :)
7484	1	a	Original game that has progressed over the years. Has diverse population that has grown outside the box. Now coders not affiliated with Steam/Valve coding new mods for Counter-Strike 1.6 After over 10+years, this game is still on strong. Come join us while you still can.
7486	1	a	;)
7488	1	a	Remember where all of us played this game in cybercafÃ©s?
7490	1	a	What can i say, game which will be always in my heart at numer 1 place.
7492	1	a	It's the best game i have 3000 hours on it!!!
7494	1	a	Great game! I started with source, and felt that this was going to be a downgrade. After playing for about four minutes, I learned how competitive the game was. I learned I wasn't good at the game, and trained for once. That was something I had never done on Counter-Strike: source.  Now it's time to talk about the bad things: First of all, although there are more servers than TFC has, there is still hardly any servers. You can find a server and join it, but most of the servers have custom maps and free guns. Obviously the graphics are a downgrade, but who plays games for graphics? I sure as hell don't. And for the year 2000 the graphics are great!  There is a misconception with this game where people think that Bunnyhopping is still in the game. It's not. They removed it in 1.4 and it is now 1.6.  Overall, BUY THIS GAME!
7496	1	a	If your computer is a toaster, this game is for you. While challenging, you can still pick up and play this game despite the assumption that you're 10 times worse than literally everyone else.
7498	1	a	why did u took my game from steam 
7500	1	a	the best multiplayer game of them all!
7502	1	a	Best fps team shooter . A lot of weapons to buy and very many gamemodes to play
7504	1	a	Good Game for lan/pub/automix/clan
7506	1	a	Cant aim. 10/10 Best game out there -IGN
7508	1	a	The biggest Competitive First Person Shooter there ever was and ever will be. Extremely Skillful and Team Based Tactic.  Amazing,  10/10  1.6 Forever  -Buy this over CS:GO
7510	1	a	Been Playing this game for 8 years , Cant Stop playing it , One of most Played games , Best FPS game and first person :D    Respect &lt;3
7512	1	a	Long time since I've played it ! Cs was/is the sh#t !!!

7516	1	a	
7518	1	a	One of the great competitive shooters that started electroic sports. High props to valve for making a legendery game
7520	1	a	BEST GAME OF ALL TIME
7522	1	a	Awesome, good fun
7524	1	a	only 11 hours listed on my account, I played hundreds if not thousands of hours before they started tracking game time.
7526	1	a	Good game 20 - 21 century and FIFA

7550	1	a	Who cares on graphics if you get the still most tactical action shooter available.
7552	1	a	 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBjd60TfTsA 
7554	1	a	Play this :p
7556	1	a	Possibly one of the greatest first person shooting games ever made. Try it out and see how you like it. Too bad that numerous number of hackers are around these days, but not a probem if server admins are present.   You can try maps like dust/dust2, assault, or even fy maps like snow and iceworld. Awp maps are also great if you like scoping and killing opponents with one shot.  Maybe even go for some of the fun surfing maps that are still around.   Lastly, fyi it does take some time to find the optimal sensitivity setting that you play the best with.
7558	1	a	This game is so good 
7560	1	a	i love this game
7562	1	a	Nice game!!!
7564	1	a	I left my Xbox 360, FB just because of this game.
7566	1	a	Playing all counter strike from the date it was released. Still one of the best games ever made.
7568	1	a	Classic never dies!
7570	1	a	Sick game, enjoy it alot
7572	1	a	old classic
7574	1	a	1.6 is still goin strong!

7578	1	a	can never go wrong with this. ever....
7580	1	a	Classic.
7582	1	a	simply the best game i've ever played (and possibly will ever)
7584	1	a	:) 
7586	1	a	I fully recommend this game to any FPS player who wants a challenge and a fast paced shooting experience.
7588	1	a	The best game :)
7590	1	a	What built to CSGO and made it into one of my favorite game
7592	1	a	
7594	1	a	Joined steam just for this game.  THE best multiplayer FPS experience you can get! UPDATE: shifted to CS GO :D ~#CS Fan
7596	1	a	Best FPS in human history. Source and GO is volvo â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ scam.
7598	1	a	Most classic game of all time?
7600	1	a	Almost 4000 hours spent in this game, never gets old, 10/10
7602	1	a	Great addictive game.
7604	1	a	Old but Best game ever ))
7606	1	a	i love this game
7608	1	a	in boats we love swag forever Jennifer Lopez
7610	1	a	one of the best fps games
7612	1	a	The original mod from half life 2, I grabbed this when it was free way back, been playing ever since, with tons of user made content, a large community to play with this game is still a great buy. Wheter your camping or lobbing nades, skill and teamwork are a must to succeed, mic's are even better, this game can be as serious as you want it to be, just don't get mad bro, lol.
7614	1	a	.
7616	1	a	I'd give this game a 65 because of the outstanding gameplay and because i am a great teacher who gives fair grades
7618	1	a	This game gave me a serious addiction until recently. It's like a drug. Don't play it :D!
7620	1	a	1337
7622	1	a	i am die hard fan of this game.. !!
7624	1	a	Best FPS of all times, nothing can beat this game.
7626	1	a	Very good game love it!
7628	1	a	Hackers everywhere,every server.Do I recommend this Game? Yes and No. If your going to play Competively your out of luck because of this games VAC. If your buying this game for offline play I recomend the Zbot and The Offical CS Bot mods.Fix this game Valve it was perfect in 2001
7630	1	a	best fps ever.the best counter strike game(following GO on 2nd place).the hardest tactical fps out there where the guns have actual recoil and you need real teamplay and cooperation to win
7632	1	a	probably the best game ever
7634	1	a	The game that started it all.  I have been playing the Counter-Strike series for as long as I have owned a PC. The name is even known to non-gamers around the world. If you haven't tried your skills in this peice of history you are missing out.
7636	1	a	Best and most played FPS of all time! What else do i need to say? Give it a try if you're not already addicted :-P
7638	1	a	This game is the best &lt;3
7640	1	a	. 
7642	1	a	Mesmerizing passion for real gamers!
7644	1	a	Very Nice!
7646	1	a	:)
7648	1	a	ofc i do the beest game ever !
7650	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6 : In order to be good at this game you will need to either do research on how the guns work or put plenty of time practicing. If you spam a lot, take note of exactly how the bullet spread goes.
7652	1	a	One of the best games that I have played in my life. Good-bye sweet 1.6.
7654	1	a	This is the best Counter-Strike ever, ruined my life. 5 stars &lt;3
7656	1	a	great game
7658	1	a	One of the best game EVER!
7660	1	a	BEST GAME EVER !!! from 2000 to 2014 ! 1.6 is still in the top 10 games in steam ! everyday we see more than 40K who play cs without forgetting the non-steam guys ! its just the best game ever ! i hope the same for csgo to be the best game ever like 1.6 used to
7662	1	a	CSSSS
7664	1	a	i guess its good but its a old game 14 years old but it has okay graphics
7666	1	a	!
7668	1	a	After many years of being out. By far one of my favorite games. I've purchased it many times for myself and friends. Even tho the graphics are shakey. With a decent modern computer and recent HD features this game looks remarkable. The physics in this game are remarkable, relastic and complicated. Its a hard game to get a grasp off, but now that you cannot just spray at ones head and get head shots. This game alongside dota, and starcraft. Were Pioneers in online competitive play and this game should recieve high acolades for its contribution to esports.
7670	1	a	Ehmm you know ;)
7672	1	a	An old timing classic. But gets quite bored in the end...
7674	1	a	One of the best games ever.
7676	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7678	1	a	Still the best.
7680	1	a	Legendary...
7682	1	a	Best gameplay, the biggest base of players and modders. Exlusively modes like Alien, Zombies, Jumps, Football or JailBreaks! Simple but legendary! Who didnt play this game, he can't call himself a 'gamer'!
7684	1	a	Toomates 4 U, enough for me ! :O
7686	1	a	The reason why Steam is alive. The reason why Valve is what it is today. Still CS 1.6 is the best our there.
7688	1	a	
7690	1	a	This was my very first PC-Game and also shooter. I started playing it in 2006, needless to say, this gem is for me one of the best games ever. It is a lot of fun playing it with friends but playing alone can also be very nice. It may be a little bit difficlut to learn, but when you know how to play you will sit there and play this game for hours and hours. I guarantee it.   10/10
7692	1	a	No matter how long I play this game, I never get bored :) #CsForever&lt;3
7694	1	a	One of my old favourites.
7696	1	a	Easy and fun. Check how good your reaction is.. ;)
7698	1	a	awsome game just loved the gameplay :)
7700	1	a	awsome game too old :D it have nice settings :D and more players who loved this game :D 10+
7702	1	a	Probably one of the best works of Valve Co.
7704	1	a	This is awesome!
7706	1	a	The best game.
7708	1	a	This was one of the first pvp first person shooters i played online back in the days of 56k modems, when a ping of 200 or lower was considered very good. I played this game for about 5 years, i even made some of my own levels for the community. Those were fun times.
7710	1	a	That's a very nice game and it's a pleasure to have it
7712	1	a	The quintessential modern combat FPS multiplayer. Often imitated, never duplicated. I spent the greater part of a decade enjoying this game. Much of the fun however came from the great friendships developed over years of online play.
7714	1	a	One of The Best multiplayer game ever.
7716	1	a	The most Amazing FPS EVAR!!!!
7718	1	a	counter strike me to mai sabki.....
7720	1	a	I actually never payed attention to this game due it's so old. But some days ago I installed it just to see if it's still active and it actually is! That's amazing. Nearly 20k still playing this game even though it's pretty old.   For the time I am playing this game I am in love with it. The community is so nice. You don't get matched-up against â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ loads of hackers like it is in CS:GO atm, it's a very fun game to play and I probably will play some hours too.
7722	1	a	Nice game. :)
7724	1	a	My first game in 2000.
7726	1	a	legendary shooter
7728	1	a	Classic, but still fantastic
7730	1	a	Spent many years playing this game and it was amazing. Console commands and the simplistic gameplay makes it a great game. Mods such as WC3, UWC3, SHERO make the game half fps half rpg which I loved :). However, like most fps', hackers ruin the game and is probably the main reason for the low population aside from the repetitiveness.
7732	1	a	Classic, functional FPS multiplayer shooter that everyone can enjoy. Although it's showing its age now that modern FPSes have the 'aim down sight' function.
7734	1	a	This is the best game I ever played
7736	1	a	great game
7738	1	a	Old but the best !
7740	1	a	What can you say about this game...
7742	1	a	Neverending story - CS 1.6 rules! Other newer versions don't even measure up to 1.6's ankles!
7744	1	a	Its ok
7746	1	a	doesnt need a recommendation, if youve played you know its the best FPS of decades
7748	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7750	1	a	It is so classic and so balanced that you just can't go wrong with Counter strike. 5/5
7752	1	a	great game 
7754	1	a	My First Loved Game and still is awesome
7756	1	a	The best shooter ever made &lt;3
7758	1	a	Counter-strike 1.6 is absolutely one of the best games ever made - ALL PLATFORMS. Soon to be 14 year old game, this game is still the most popular game in CS-franchise. I would recommend any new player to CS, to actually first buy CS 1.6/Anthology, because this game is golden.
7760	1	a	Life changing game; gives birth to a new, game changing life!
7762	1	a	
7764	1	a	Destroyed Gaming/Avadis
7766	1	a	shoot people in the face and not get arrested for it. brilliant game concept for people that struggle with anger issues.
7768	1	a	old school time... the best game ever made very simple and competitive
7770	1	a	I'll say one thing... it's a challenge and like that i'm sombody that isnt really good at this game but i can still mange to get that rewarding 3 kills or headshot.imo i think that this a good game challenging but rewarding in the for me that is. Im 13 years old and i just came from CZ and i like it. More severs than CZ so more fun.
7772	1	a	Simply the legendary mulitiplayer first person shooter.  It has now become reduced to thousands of servers full of tens of thousands of Counter-Terrorist and Terrorist bots in a perpetual endless war spamming their radio commands killing each other mainly on de_dust2  The only full servers are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing BR spamming the chats U GIB ME MONIES OR I REPOT U HUHUHUEHUE HUE HUE HUE JAJAJAJJAJAJAJAJJA JAJA JA JA
7774	1	a	Stress out
7776	1	a	tb
7778	1	a	Best game ever, too bad there many cheaters on it.. R.I.P.
7780	1	a	Old good classic!
7782	1	a	I recommend this game
7784	1	a	A Classical Game that Every Real Gamer should respect!
7786	1	a	5/5
7788	1	a	First game I ever played online and worked hard at becoming a pro at. &lt;3 CS. My last id was ari1911386. #oldmemories #loveforthegame #respectplayers #donotcheat #playhardgopro #rusher #onlyheadshots #nostalgic

7812	1	a	this game wa fiha lagg  
7814	1	a	Absolutely fabulous. Just buy it, if you like true FPS games, that require practice bur never get boring, here is one excellent for you.
7816	1	a	doesnt matter how old it is .. still a very good n entertaining game...
7818	1	a	Awesome game, but is dead. Every pro player migrated to CS:GO, which is a CS 1.6 with upgrades and nice graphics!
7820	1	a	This game is great, but you can not put the gun target. I think that is the only downside the game is well thought otherwise.
7822	1	a	GREAT OLD FASHIONED Classiscal Game from VALVE &lt;3
7824	1	a	Fun game, playing for blakecoins n such
7826	1	a	Epicness Redefined!
7828	1	a	the best
7830	1	a	Awesome Game.. love it
7832	1	a	yeah marvallous game..!!

7842	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yea! the counterstrike superhero mod is fun
7844	1	a	I recommend this game because the great gift pile asked me to. Also because it's still the best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing shooter out there. That's right, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Call of Duty, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Battlefied, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Halo. 1.6 peoples.
7846	1	a	Good old game.. Stil alive! Gathers, or other servers.. MIX'es, IRC chaneels... Good memories :)
7848	1	a	The first and possibly the best Counter Stirke. Over a decade later and still thousands play it a day? Other than Nintendo nobody has been able to master something like this as well as it is here. With a huge install base, small game but wonderful gameplay, this is worth your $10
7850	1	a	yes a good game if played in a good computers, awesome experience at 100 fps. Will suggest a gaming mouse and a pad for best aiming
7852	1	a	yes...i have done it...and at last i wana say this game is like a drug addiction.many ways to play in this game clan,pub,gungame,base bulding abd all kind of zombie games...simply i like clan play...its not enough to give your 100% in game..you have to do more better...this game is really awsm...i have no words to describe the game cs 1.6 specially

7868	1	a	This game is still going strong after 15 years. What more is there to say? It has never been done better than this. Easy to learn, but can take years to really master.
7870	1	a	Classic!
7872	1	a	Recommended 10/10. Everything , i really mean everything in this game is great. (except for the graphics , but if im not wrong this game is from 1999 ,sooooo... yeah , just buy it)

7936	1	a	Very nice game. That's it.
7938	1	a	I have played this long ago. It was good. 'Virtual reality, whoa!'
7940	1	a	its nice
7942	1	a	10/10
7944	1	a	Classic Oldschool Game!
7946	1	a	Classic, interesting and also a good way to make friends. LIKE IT!!!
7948	1	a	I grew up playing Cs 1.6, this is one of the best games late 90's !
7950	1	a	One of the best FPS out there!
7952	1	a	Check out those 2 hardcore â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s on the cover. That should tell you all you need to know about the game. And what kind of name is Counter Strike? Did they name it COunter Attack and realise that sounded too genreic and decided to name it something off? Or maybe this game is about the strike of counter-tops? We may never lnow. Like i said, look at those two hardcore GSG9 and GIGN operators and that should tell you all you need to know  Money and time sink, like the Philadelphia Experiment only with less GOvernment coverups. I should be studying SS what is this   0/10 struck too hard would not counter
7954	1	a	Best off
7956	1	a	Probably the game that kick-started the Steam success, Counter Strike still is a game of choice of the Top Worldwide Electronic Sports Leagues and Championships with a vibrant and huge community of players and tournaments. No one gets called a true gamer until it plays it.
7958	1	a	Classic Game. nuff said
7960	1	a	A classic from the heyday of Quake, Warcraft 3, and Brood Wars. The game that gave e-sports a face and a true legend in its own right. Still rocking 13 years later with one of the biggest communities on steam. The One, The Only, COUNNNNNNTERRR-STRIKKKKKKKEEEEEE!
7962	1	a	OH! The classic Counter-Strike... the first and best FPS I've played. It just brings sooo many memories playing with friends, so many laughs, etc.. If you've never played CS, please, just quit life!
7964	1	a	Mother off all first person shooters. You have to buy this game to show respect to valve and shooters. It`s ORDER!!!!! 
7966	1	a	The Best CS Game in my childhood
7968	1	a	The Best Game in My Life :D
7970	1	a	the best first person shooter game ever.
7972	1	a	epic first person shooter! Its the basic game for gamers who like first person shooter
7974	1	a	5415
7976	1	a	old but nice
7978	1	a	Recomendo Counter Strike 1.6
7980	1	a	It does not get better than this game... No matter how many more CS come out.
7982	1	a	For many, the original Counter-Strike remains the definitive online shooter. Tens of thousands hop onto servers every day to continue the eternal battle between terrorists and counter-terrorists. CS is an almost perfectly balanced mix of teamwork and individual skill with enough depth and nuance to inspire countless esports competitions. Valve have attempted to improve on the formula with Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but the original remains the go-to choice for online action gamers with top twitch skills.
7984	1	a	Cool game. ;)
7986	1	a	-.-
7988	1	a	One of my most favorite games. 10/10
7990	1	a	This game is the best shooter game and the game that i liked the most!  But There is nothing for non steam players that hack in the servers!
7992	1	a	Good, old Counter Strike! One of the 'must play' games.
7994	1	a	GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME!
7996	1	a	Very Good Game !
7998	1	a	i have played this since i was 10 years old, what a classic game !!, always enjoyed the Lans and clans involved, very enjoyable, shame its gone downhill so much though!
8000	1	a	
8002	1	a	^_^
8004	1	a	Literally inspired Sandy Hook.
8006	1	a	This game is a classic and it is highly competitive. It is recommended for all who are new to the FPS genre or just want to improve their skills. It even tops many FPS today. I rate it 9.5/10
8008	1	a	... just play the game! (Without cheats plz?...)
8010	1	a	Call of Duty is back again with another smashing hit, but it's not called Call Of Duty.  You can shoot guns in this one too, and that's swell.
8012	1	a	I have some problems with this cs I have added many servers to my favourites but none of them are coming in 'Find Servers' tab + my connection is working fine. My humble request please fix this issue.
8014	1	a	Umm been playing it for 10+ years i like it

8050	1	a	:]
8052	1	a	Nice game.:)
8054	1	a	...
8056	1	a	Well easy gameplay, hard online. It still continues to be one of the first cs.  Price: Good Gameplay: Easy Overall: 8/10
8058	1	a	The best FPS team based tact shooter on the market hands down. if you dont believe me just check its history.
8060	1	a	This is simply a legend. Who never played and enjoyed this game, cannot call himself a gamer.
8062	1	a	Nostalgia ftw
8064	1	a	my best game of all the time &lt;3
8066	1	a	Counter-Strike is defiantly dated, so I recommend getting the newer ones, but you are not going wrong with this one if you decide to pick it up.  7/10
8068	1	a	The wonderful classic that sparked a legendary FPS series. 10/10
8070	1	a	Okey,Good story.

8086	1	a	Nice game...AWESOME (y)
8088	1	a	This one here is a winner.
8090	1	a	A nice game which requires cooperative playing because of objective like placing/defusing the bomb or killing Terrorists/CTs
8092	1	a	Ah, Counter-Strike. What can I say about you that hasn't been said already by your millions of fans. As one of the most popular Half-Life mods to become into a full retail game by Valve, I surely can say this...  Counter-Strike 1.6 started it all.  As an original mod from Valve's game: Half-Life, Counter-Strike grew increasely popular til' this day, spawning updated verisons such as Source &amp; Global Offensive. Even the overly repetitive Call of Duty has been influenced by Counter-Strike, even thou Activision's changed it's view after Modern Warfare 1, but now I'm getting off topic...  In conclusion, there really is no explaination from me to describe this popular game. Counter-Strike's gameplay explains it's self to the community.  10/10.
8094	1	a	Awesome Game Play Thsi Game Friends
8096	1	a	Play Counter-Strike and be convinced that Counter-Strike is the best game ever.
8098	1	a	this is my favorit game. got best moments &lt;3
8100	1	a	.
8102	1	a	â™¥
8104	1	a	cs go player must have skills from this game! :)
8106	1	a	Just play it!
8108	1	a	The BEST game for ever ... &lt;3
8110	1	a	Best game on the PC, game 13 years ! the audience of players still be numbered in the millions. The perfect game engine provides unlimited possibilities, a large number of modes (Zombi, Biohazard, Surf, GunGame, Jump etc) make the game varied and exciting. Only here you can with one clip to put entire opposing team, then plays the role of your skills playing shooters. The only game in which you can play for years and still have fun.
8112	1	a	Is there really necessary to say something about CS? I dont think so. Legendary multiplayer action game that lives for decades!
8114	1	a	wtf, how is this game still $5?
8116	1	a	Still playing.. 
8118	1	a	Cool
8120	1	a	Public  BenNghe.net 
8122	1	a	Cool Game
8124	1	a	very good game
8126	1	a	I played this for 2 hours back when I was 15 or something. I sucked at it and people yelled at me. I think if I had spoke on the in-game vent thing they would have treated me differently, but I'm no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
8128	1	a	Without a doubt the best multiplayer game in the universe! Will probably stay that way for at least 10 more years!
8130	1	a	The best shooter of all time
8132	1	a	Amazing. Although many pro players play it, and nobody speaks english.
8134	1	a	What is there to say.. it's counter strike, the best shooter I've ever played, forged COD, CS forever.
8136	1	a	Great Game
8138	1	a	
8140	1	a	This is my latest account so i don't have many hours on this, but this game genuinely is one of the best games ever made and it's the source of many beautiful games.
8142	1	a	It combines the best of team based gaming with an authentic and therefore exciting approach to tactical ops.
8144	1	a	You can't describe CS. It's CS!
8146	1	a	GET ON MY LEVEL.... One of the best FPS Games, the 1.6 Version will stay always in our hearts. I recommend it for everyone who wants a tactical/action shooter Games!! :)
8148	1	a	Good old counter strike :) a lot of good memories
8150	1	a	!!
8152	1	a	Childhood.
8154	1	a	Highly addictive 3D oldschool FPS game. Everyone should know this game.
8156	1	a	  GOOD COUNTER-STRIKE. THIS IS CLASSIC.
8158	1	a	Buy the complete pack for $7.50, nuff said
8160	1	a	my counter strike 1.6 doesn t work why???
8162	1	a	^. ^
8164	1	a	:)
8166	1	a	One of the most fun and natural feeling military shooters ever made. There is a good reason people still play it nearly 8 years on...
8168	1	a	the BEST ONLINE FPS game. not as good as v1.5 though. but since 1.5 is no longer available, this will have to do. 
8170	1	a	Addiction :)
8172	1	a	THe best game ever played!
8174	1	a	For more than 10 years this game still has billions of players playing it including me. Possibility to create and customize your own game arena. The textures may not seem the best, but the gameplay and strategy really sucks you in. My first shooter game I've bought, only because of respect to developers.
8176	1	a	this is the online game that started it all for me, its slowly dying but always always I find myself going back to it. 
8178	1	a	:)
8180	1	a	#ftw......Its the best online, multiplayer, LAN and FPS game ever if u ask me, so I am not even going to rate it !! xD  For those of you who don't know, there are a lot of professional matches, competitions, tournaments and leagues held for this game and the prize money is also pretty handsome, so don't underestimate it ;)  #The million dollar question :- Counter-Strike, a sport or not ?  I say - A BIG yes !!
8182	1	a	Did anyone not play this game at some point or another. As elusive to me as football and stock car racing in it's ability to transfix the lives and minds of some shall we say, unenlightened 'gamers' out there.
8184	1	a	The simple fact that this 10+ years old game still shows up in the top played games on Steam clearly says something about its quality. I feel like I shouldn't even recommend it, as its name speaks for itself. Easy to pick up, difficult to master, Counter-Strike is one, if not the best multiplayer FPS out there, and it'll probably remain that way for many years to come. The fact that this game rivals it sequels in number of players worldwide only shows how great this game is.  So, do yourself a favour and get it.
8186	1	a	Good one
8188	1	a	This is Counter-Strike 1.6, the latest version of the original Counter-Strike. The graphics are far inferior to the source version but the gameplay is considered better by most Counter-Strike veterans. This has some maps not found in the source verison and has the riot shield which is not in the source version either. The riot shield allows you to avoid bullets but you cannot have a primary weapon if you have it equiped so you can only use your sidearm. This version also features a gamemode not available in the source version. The gamemode is where you must protect a player controlling a VIP while they make their way to the rescue vehicle. If you want to see how different this is from the source version then go right ahead, it's only $5.00 on steam so you have nothing to lose.
8190	1	a	This is just a classics.
8192	1	a	Game is great bro... too great
8194	1	a	i cant live without counter-strike ..
8196	1	a	361
8198	1	a	Classic !
8200	1	a	still want to play 24*7 ..
8202	1	a	classy!
8204	1	a	The classic. Nothing compares!
8206	1	a	Classic and never goes old
8208	1	a	CS 1.6
8210	1	a	:)
8212	1	a	I shot you;re head with awp, why u no die?!
8214	1	a	Cool old Game!
8216	1	a	the community is harsh. I suck at this game. supplies running low hope crumbling
8218	1	a	The best game on Steam store :3
8220	1	a	Grew up with CS. Highly recommended as a parental figure replacement.
8222	1	a	Just awsome !
8224	1	a	cs 1.6, gameplay is good, good fps shooter game, enjoy it. BUY IT
8226	1	a	I can't believe this game is not Free-To-Play yet. I mean, it's been like, what? 15 years? And people can simply just download the non-steam version. Should really be Free-To-Play to encourage non-steamers to play it on Steam.
8228	1	a	Back in high school I used to live and die by this game -- then got a girlfriend and my gaming time diminished to an almost non-existent level for a couple of years and I just fell away from CS. Still, it was great fun. Ran a clan, competed in OGL team matches, etc. Great game especially if you get a group of friends together to run with.
8230	1	a	Ilove this game
8232	1	a	Counter Strike rocks! its the only game I can hop on and jump right into action in 5 minutes.
8234	1	a	awsome game 
8236	1	a	It's a classic, some may not like it but definitely it's a must-play for everyone. It's just a regular multiplayer-only FPS, so its rating highly depends on people you play with. BTW, thanks to this game you have Steam. Well, maybe not, but... Ahh, nevermind.
8238	1	a	:)
8240	1	a	Still addictive to play and very fun! With lots of servers to still play in.
8242	1	a	this game is old
8244	1	a	Cool game ;]
8246	1	a	Well known fps shooter game Counter-strike will change your life! Don't be lazy to pay 9â‚¬ for such good game. I recommend you to try this game! Seeya ingame :)
8248	1	a	Old but gold
8250	1	a	Nothing like the good old days with the Classic of the Classics, Counter Strike has been such a huge game for me, and also for the world as one of the most played multiplayer games on the internet, I remember like if it was yesterday the old days when i was a children playing LAN games on the Computer Class with my classmates, and not forgetting when i learned to play it with the help of my older brother, it is such a nostalgic game and one of the best IÂ´ve owned in my life. Totally recommended to get back to the old days
8252	1	a	Original is always the best, none the less.....CZ was alright, but this is where the real fun started. Let the good times roll!
8254	1	a	Still the best imo :)
8256	1	a	still the best counter-strike out there to date.
8258	1	a	Fat Albert seal of approval
8260	1	a	Simple Adictive and Elegant !
8262	1	a	Addictive ;)
8264	1	a	The only one game that holding me for more then ten years.
8266	1	a	Great game! The BESt cs ever made!
8268	1	a	Pretty cool game if you're into killing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and being leet
8270	1	a	best there is, best there was, best there ever will be
8272	1	a	Its CS 'nough said
8274	1	a	No matter what, hands down my favorite PC game. All-time best shooter, in my opinion, and I'm always hoping for the comeback.
8276	1	a	very cool game.
8278	1	a	Very good game, but that russians people so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ :S
8280	1	a	Great game, would play again 10/10.
8282	1	a	Old but Gold! Simple mechanics, lots of mods, and a great game to blow off some steam.
8284	1	a	It's my favorite game and the best game
8286	1	a	Classic FPS
8288	1	a	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8290	1	a	superb Game must try !
8292	1	a	Play tomorrow, Play today! @_@
8294	1	a	A very good and classic game! I think it's the most played game since publish...Counter-Strike 1.6 is for those players, who love competition! It's not so easy to be the best in this game, so you must spend some time learning techniques, map-controlling, weapons and so on...it's a very nice game to spend your time on! I recommend it to all of my friends and for anybody else!
8296	1	a	Go 10 years back and this was the first FPS game I came across, and the first game I ever spent tons of hours on. I keep coming back to it even in my adult years. Perfect game for kids. Great at teaching essential values regarding life. Some of the best voice-acting and most memeroable quotes in any form of media. 'Fire hole' is a classic.
8298	1	a	:)
8300	1	a	love it. controls are so solid and the maps are good. new one coming out in 2011 i heard.
8302	1	a	^^
8304	1	a	Wait... you don't own this game already!? What's WRONG WITH YOU!? How have you not owned this since its' release!? For shame! You might as well just wait for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to come out, since you waited this long to even get Counter-Strike. I'm ashamed of you.
8306	1	a	HD Graphics, better than Battlefield 5
8308	1	a	Steam is what it is today because of this game! 10/10
8310	1	a	Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.
8312	1	a	Best Shooter
8314	1	a	Great game! Addicted to it! Gives you skills!
8316	1	a	a cult classic of culminating counter-terror camaraderie
8318	1	a	Cool game ;)
8320	1	a	A true classic multiplayer FPS. Difficult for beginners.
8322	1	a	the leggend.
8324	1	a	Never gets old.. Classic shooter with great gameplay.
8326	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 is much more difficult to get used to over CSS, but it is much more satisfying to succeed in. Recommended!
8328	1	a	The best game ever :)
8330	1	a	Great shooting game :) still one of my favorit shooting games
8332	1	a	Yeap. It's the game that covered all my life. I've it when i was 6 and it makes me much more relaxed than everything.
8334	1	a	It has 13 years since it came out and a lot of people still play it. As you can see, gameplay is more important than graphics.
8336	1	a	Superb Game ...... xD must have it :D 
8338	1	a	Well what to say about this game..legendary.. =)
8340	1	a	World's number 1 online action game. 
8342	1	a	You get kinda bored after a while..... it's interesting until you meet players with cheats and so on..... this game was a good RPS but his time has passed ;x
8344	1	a	Just CS 1.6
8346	1	a	Classic game that will never die!
8348	1	a	Remember, when you play CS the Terrorists have already won.
8350	1	a	Great game! 5*
8352	1	a	This game is amazing if you like any counter strike try this one out the recoil is diffrent but oh well
8354	1	a	Still the shooter ever.
8356	1	a	+nostalgic game +best game modes of multiplayer +best maps +so much fun  recommend for all peoples who like nostalgic video games - 9.8/10
8358	1	a	Ahhhh CS 1.6 it is kind of dead now, but I couldn't begin to tell you how much time I ahve spent just playing this game. It is fun and takes actual skill, unlike that easy-mode CS:Source.
8360	1	a	This is the best and always willbe the best cs ever i would never stop playing it till i die i love it so much.
8362	1	a	great way to spend some down time
8364	1	a	.
8366	1	a	Boom Head-shot! Fun back in the day... I would presonally go with CS:S
8368	1	a	Awsome game
8370	1	a	Amazing game, will never get old. Probably better than both CS:S and GO because of the price and they're all basically the exact same thing.
8372	1	a	Wasted
8374	1	a	This is the reason I made a steam-account.. a must-own ;)
8376	1	a	  Game is very good  i like this game and go buy it this game and go funny go play
8378	1	a	Spent ages with this game, its physics and all is a gem of computer gaming. With its price, everyone should have it (and play it! a lot!).
8380	1	a	This game... It takes ALOT of skills just to be good at it. I mean, I get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at this game, and I AM a seasoned FPS player. I guess 10 years ago I would play this game to death..
8382	1	a	Even though it is old, this game sure lives to today, and is still great!
8384	1	a	Valve has taken a large selection of the maps from Counter-Strike 1.6 - Office, Havana, Italy, Aztec, Chateau, Cobble, Piranesi and of course eternal favourites Dust and Dust 2, and recreated them...
8386	1	a	This game is massive time killer. It manages to be both simple and addictive, while having no customization, no unlocks, no achievements, nothing to distract you. This game will have tens of thousands of players from all over the world for all eternity.   Those players are generally silent, but trolling and griefing is not at all unknown. This game is also very well known for cheaters. Several admins have bizarre rules that only make sense to them on their servers, so expect to be banned from a few.   There are a few popular mods for this game, one being the Warcraft mod. You are generally required to read the notes on how to use these mods, but there are plenty of vanilla servers.
8388	1	a	In some cases a multiplayer game/component gets just about everything right. This is one of those cases.
8390	1	a	I must have put 200 hours in this game, oh man those were the days. I miss you 1.3, lmao.
8392	1	a	This is no1 FPS game in the world, King of Esport game.
8394	1	a	Best multiplayer FPS in the history, and today one of the best PC game. But good days of this game are permanently away. Valve destroying this game every day, but community is stronger, as they think. People played this game years ago and will play further. VIVA CS
8396	1	a	Grenades flies like piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but game still cool for tactical multiplayer shooter.
8398	1	a	One of the best FPS of all time.
8400	1	a	'The Best' for his time !! :)
8402	1	a	This game got me into FPS games. 'Nuff said.
8404	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s are cool, and so is this game.
8406	1	a	......
8408	1	a	best teamplay game
8410	1	a	the best FPS in the world forever!!!
8412	1	a	The most important FPS in competitive gaming history. Respect.
8414	1	a	Its a all time classics
8416	1	a	A great fps, if you dont own this, buy it.
8418	1	a	IT'S F***ING CS!!!
8420	1	a	
8422	1	a	Great game. A lot of people still playing, full/modded servers. Its easy to get into, and its cheap
8424	1	a	i would strike the counter hard if i could return this bad game
8426	1	a	This game is a legend !
8428	1	a	This is a classic. Much better since they added Widescreen and HD reslutions.
8430	1	a	I think i watched a high school friend play this once. Actually, it might have been the unreal tournament version. W/E!
8432	1	a	This will be your best friend when your awesome pc/laptop breaks down.
8434	1	a	Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.
8436	1	a	Awsome game getting outdated
8438	1	a	Classic, classic, classic. Will this game ever die? :)
8440	1	a	the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8442	1	a	The Best !!! &lt;3
8444	1	a	A friggen classic in shooters, play it and love it
8446	1	a	Ok, this is an internet classic; it's been the butt of many meme jokes, but you just can't help getting past the fact that it became an internet classic. With Terrorist versus CT matches, weapons that would make your head spin and a variety of game modes and community based maps, CS is just one of those games you can't pass up.
8448	1	a	Some would say this game started it all
8450	1	a	Counter-Strike is one of those games that I can play for only 2 minutes. Seriously, the graphics suck big chicken nuggets. The thumbnail for this game makes it seem like it's graphically in tents, but it is not. I'd say wait for sale then buy because this game sucks.
8452	1	a	great game !
8454	1	a	5*
8456	1	a	The best
8458	1	a	It`s a very nice game. Try it !
8460	1	a	Cant fight it, best game I ever played. No further information needed. &lt;3
8462	1	a	:)
8464	1	a	this game is so.....ESSY!
8466	1	a	.
8468	1	a	Nice Game (Y)
8470	1	a	One of the best game of all time :D
8472	1	a	I'm a player FPS Games i can't find anouther game fps like counter-strike 1.6 or globale offansive i think this is my best game i play it in my life i wish can find anouther game bcz the cheaters are stuped when he use that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Stop using cheat plz and thank you â™¥
8474	1	a	Best game of all time
8476	1	a	Oldschool, nice mechanic, pro game phisics. Forget about nice graphic, drop out cool free to play systems with donations for hats. This game is really for ninja maniacs.
8478	1	a	Nearly comes close to Call of Duty, oh wait it doesn't.
8480	1	a	This game passed the test of time
8482	1	a	Cs is awesome, its a game that only requieres skill and not ranks and that crap.
8484	1	a	There simply is nothing like this game. Whether its the nostalgia from years past, or the fact that i still have fun playing it 14 years after its release, it is one of a kind. They will keep releasing newer versions of the game (Condition Zero, Source, Global Offensive), and not that these are not good games, they just do not do for me what the original has always done. Even coming back to the game after not being able to play for years I still find the fun that i had in the very beginning. If you are into cutting edge high graphics and realism, it probably isnt for you. If you have a taste for the classics, however, then cs 1.6 is for you.
8486	1	a	The only thing I've spent time on cybercafes playing while others where watching porn.
8488	1	a	It's a quite good game. I play from time to time when I have nothing to do. Definetely the best FPS of the whole CS series. RECOMMEND!
8490	1	a	Oldschool FPS, Beats all the newer Counter-Strike's.... 10/10
8492	1	a	out dated i only weedhop in it. turbad game
8494	1	a	;;)
8496	1	a	POLECAM CS 1 ANTHOLOGY!
8498	1	a	This game is SUPER
8500	1	a	the best game
8502	1	a	Such 1.6 very wow such high FPS wow smooth
8504	1	a	Probably the best online FPS out there to date. Still a large playerbase after all these years should make it clear. The best part is probably how even if you have a crappy, very low budget computer you should be able to run this old game without any issues and have a load of fun. If this isn't in your steam library and you enjoy playing online FPS games then give this jem a go.
8506	1	a	AweSOmE gaME anD no dOUbT wHY iTS woRLdS nO.1 onLiNE mULtipLaYEr gAmE. :D
8508	1	a	Buy it, but get PODbot
8510	1	a	This is a good classic
8512	1	a	best game that i ever played , recommend to all
8514	1	a	The game is very fun and I recommend it to everyone
8516	1	a	Counter-Strike can join in with Golden Eye in taking credit for defining the comman FPS game as we know it today. It's servers are still active over a decade of entertainment. You customize your gear then choose to either use tactics to disarm the bomb, or you can JUST RUSH IN LIKE AN INSANE PERSON, GRIP THE HOSTAGES BY THE ARM AS YOU SAY 'FOLLOW ME NOW!!!', and get them to safety. It is pure greatness. And the system requirements are not demanding, so virtualy any computer nowadays can run it.
8518	1	a	Good game, no comment :) 10/10 
8520	1	a	I want to play But i cant play
8522	1	a	Didn't spend much time on this game,at all.

8528	1	a	the best games 
8530	1	a	Old is Gold.
8532	1	a	Its a great FPS game
8534	1	a	Counter Strike changed the landscape of multiplayer first person shooter. Ruthless gameplay, perfect balance contributed towards the creation of a very competitive scene. Years later it still stands as one the giants among games. Loved and still played by thousands, it has shaped lives and destinies.   
8536	1	a	:)

8598	1	a	;)
8600	1	a	CRAAAP dnt wast ur pennys on this lol
8602	1	a	Great game!
8604	1	a	The popularity of this game had suprised me  Yeasterday i were watching a finnish document, which shows a normal life of poor peoples, one episode told about Nenetsi tribes who lives in northen Siberia. There were also a episode that showed deleted scenes of this document show. This episode showed that there were a small power generator in one of the nenetsi tents and there were one nenetsi guy who had get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ laptop from someone. Even this guy played counter strike. and in norther siberia!!!!. if you have a computer whith internet connection you must have cs it is so populargame. and good game also
8606	1	a	!!
8608	1	a	Really good game, it brings back the feelings'
8610	1	a	Brilliant game. Excellent for team strategy, accuracy and reflexes.  
8612	1	a	5*
8614	1	a	better then all the other Counter Strike versions available on Steam. If you want to experience the classic CS, get it!
8616	1	a	Awesome OLD Schoooool Game :) I hop on to this when im sick on CS:GO
8618	1	a	;)
8620	1	a	little problem, there should be 3 options when u click new game, server server settings or server info and game, i have the first (server) and the second (game) i cant add bots and i cant change the settings, how do i fix this?
8622	1	a	Very Fun and Simple Killing
8624	1	a	;)
8626	1	a	too much skills n efforts needed to become a pro.
8628	1	a	Counter-Strike is very nice old school game! Ofcourse graphic side is very old and looks very primitive, but gameplay is not repeatable. Gamers which once played this game will play it over and over. Phisics in game is developed very nice, all objects can be shooted through. I rate this game 7 of 10. One of the best shooters game ever.
8630	1	a	Nice game
8632	1	a	CS1.6 in my top 10 all time favorite games including it's previous versions of which ive played 1.3-1.5 without a doubt the keystone in FPS gaming history and a must for all who claim to be hardcore gamer's 10/10
8634	1	a	part of me &lt;3
8636	1	a	1 of the best.
8638	1	a	whats life lol
8640	1	a	This games is Cool :p
8642	1	a	12465133
8644	1	a	Is very good game
8646	1	a	Addictive... Probably the best replay value of any game ever.
8648	1	a	Simple? Yes Outdated? Yes Fun? Yes  This is a classic FPS must-have. Although most of my enjoyment in this game comes from the nostalgia of playing this back in the mid to late 2000's, newcomers will also find enjoyment in this trigger-happy gem. This is the original Counter-Strike, and it is a 10/10 good time.
8650	1	a	I had an ight time playing this
8652	1	a	the best shooter with friends
8654	1	a	Old school love this game ;P
8656	1	a	This Game wat 2 say dis Is d bst game In d world for all the plyrs  from India  it Was a Hit game it will Be and it should nVr end dis Game
8658	1	a	Nice game. but some cheated.
8660	1	a	The game that started it all for me. Simple and to the point is how i would discribe it. Bad guys vs good guys, eliminate the team and take your place in the CS hall of fame. I ended up playing this game for a professional team in the CPL tournaments.
8662	1	a	very awsome game
8664	1	a	Too much better than CS GO ;)
8666	1	a	Simply the best
8668	1	a	Good Game But many Cheatrs
8670	1	a	Best game of all time ! Had my best years with this game
8672	1	a	:p love tis classic cs
8674	1	a	This game is a legend and everyone who has a computer knows it. Hours of playing and still lots of fun... The older it is... the better...
8676	1	a	1,6
8678	1	a	:o
8680	1	a	Best fps game ever played

8684	1	a	hardest game ever appeared
8686	1	a	well.. its a okay game,
8688	1	a	awesome game i love it &lt;3
8690	1	a	I always find myself coming back to play this game. A true classic
8692	1	a	
8694	1	a	top
8696	1	a	If you've never played the original Counter Strike you might as well give it a go. Originally a mod for Half-Life, Counter Strike quickly became an extremely popular fps game.
8698	1	a	COUNTER TERRORISTS WIN
8700	1	a	Fifty years later people will remember this game. It is timeless, just as super smash bros. melee is, dota1/2, and starcraft, etc.   At the competitive level no other game tops this as a team based esports fps. So many mechanics to learn, bhopping, ladders, russian walks, spamming crouch to short hop, grenades are 1 pixel width, floaty nade physics, flashes, smokes, all these raise the skill ceiling. Too much to say for what I have experienced, try it yourself, and goodluck finding the niche gametype you prefer.
8702	1	a	. 
8704	1	a	In my opinion this is the forefather of all fps games, it's been the most succesful and popular fps game of alltime.  I remember when Counter-Strike was just a mod, but later it was made into a standalone game.  This game is not about the graphics, it's about the gameplay, the unique feeling you get while playing it.  It's nothing like a Call of Duty game or even Battlefield, this game has something in it I just can't describe.  I would give this game 5 of 5 stars.
8706	1	a	like my source review, this is one of the most highly played FPS for a reason. the game that changed it all. if you don't have it, you do not know shooters.
8708	1	a	the best game
8710	1	a	it's funny games   now this game is not serious games like in 2006 since now CS:GO more better than other CS  but, this game is have one special for me
8712	1	a	Happy 15th birthday CS!
8714	1	a	You can COUNT on that STRIKE! *Badum Tch*
8716	1	a	yo this game rox 
8718	1	a	Tons of hours of tons of fun. I reccomend this to anyone
8720	1	a	A brilliant game.
8722	1	a	The best game Ever :)
8724	1	a	top (y)
8726	1	a	I played a lot of games.I tried games with advanced mechanics,fancy graphics.I tried mods and all guides.Still,I never catch the feeling I get with Counter Strike.It is plain and fair.I love the purity of it.It's also absolutely fair.No skillpoints,no classes,no glamour-only gloss.It is the ultimate first person shooter.Simply the best ever.
8728	1	a	Good old clasic game!!!! 
8730	1	a	THE BEST GAME EVER.CS 1.6 &lt;3
8732	1	a	Best cs ever.
8734	1	a	Great game 
8736	1	a	Come play then rage quit because of mexicans and hackers  
8738	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8740	1	a	Very best game :DDDDD
8742	1	a	great game
8744	1	a	1.6
8746	1	a	This is an interesting game. It is incredibly difficult to rate it either 'yes' or 'no.' There are far too many points to consider. Counter-Strike was released nearly fourteen years ago, yet it is still difficult to find an open server. It is incredibly fun and can make you laugh or tear your hair out. This game can be excellent for fans of strategy games and shooters, but it's very rare to be able to enjoy it fully. Unless you play on competitive servers, most everyone goes 'rogue' and does not work as a team. There are frequent cheaters using programs to increase movement speed, look through walls, or assist in aiming. If you look through the community page, many of the posts are pictures of cats or pornography. When joining a new game, you always feel paranoid about what the server is downloading. The community can be very scary; you must play on servers you trust with people you respect. If you can do this, you will have a blast. Counter-Strike is still played by a huge number of people; you can find great servers with great communities in nearly every language imaginable. There's a wide variety of weapons to choose from, and it is simple to get in on the action. There are no pay-to-win or customization featuresâ€”only action. Counter-Strike can be a fantastic game if you know how to use it properly.  Things to note: â€¢ There are no bots in CS. However, the Counter-Strike: Condition Zero package (probably the best way to purchase the game) includes Condition Zero, which has support for bots and can be played without an Internet connection. â€¢ This is not 1.6 (to my knowledge); there are no shields and a few things are different (the difference is negligible). However, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero still has these features. â€¢ This is considered a mod for Half-Life. However, it can be downloaded independently. Note that Counter-Strike will be saved inside the 'Half-Life' folder on your computer.
8748	1	a	Best of the best first person shooters
8750	1	a	Old legendary game :D
8752	1	a	Great Game
8754	1	a	love this game  
8756	1	a	I spent countless of hours on this game back in my youth. I had a late start and started 1.5 but I remember trying to play competitively by requesting scrimmages with clans in my PUG. My â™¥â™¥â™¥ got completed handed to me but it was fun times. Staying up late and playin awp_map.  I really hope that CS:GO is part of the steam sale this year. I missed the chances to pick it up in the past but I hope I can pick it up this time.

8846	1	a	This game is just 11/10
8848	1	a	+++
8850	1	a	The original Counter-Strike was one of the most played games of my life. I've spent countless hours playing this game from 1999 to the release of Counter-Strike Condition Zero. I can remember so many things about this game like the old PunkBuster anti-hacking program, the transfer from a standalone game to being forced to use Steam to play my Valve titles, the countless hackers using OGC and the amazing community created maps. There are more maps, weapon skins and character skins released for this game than probably any other game ever made. This is truly a classic and will be one of my favorites forever. Long Live Counter-Strike 1.6!
8852	1	a	the best
8854	1	a	I bought the whole CS 1 anthology.Great time-terrible decision.  Lets get to the point-When you start,you..well get blasted in the face.Honsetly when i started on the scoreboard it was 1:15 so yeah. Glock,usp,deagle,mp5,famas,galil,cv-47,m4 and Awp that is going to kill ye most of the time. Have fun buying and playing :)
8856	1	a	Classic.
8858	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
8860	1	a	Better then CS: GO
8862	1	a	i love thes game
8864	1	a	Recomand :D
8866	1	a	This game truly has changed and as much as i wish i still enjoyed it, all the changes have turned me away. I will always recommend this game but for myself, i will stick with GO.
8868	1	a	Still one of the best!!!
8870	1	a	
8872	1	a	Skeet shooting at its finest
8874	1	a	This game is horrible why aren't the graphics good like Call of Duty: Ghosts that game has very gud graphics wow Valve more like Bad oh snap
8876	1	a	Its a very cool game. Not old, just a good Classic!
8878	1	a	.

8894	1	a	The best fps of all time !
8896	1	a	Great FPS game.Yes, it has not the best graphics, but if you want to have a nice aim, nice game collection and etc. you should buy this game.  It doesn't have any achievements, but i gurantee that you will have fun there!
8898	1	a	since 2k8, lovely game.
8900	1	a	...
8902	1	a	IMMA BE L33T WHERE ARE THE PU$$Y AT?!?
8904	1	a	Probably the greatest team FPS that there ever was, Was way ahead of its time in all departments. Still to this day has full servers full of dedicated players 24-7. To think that it was originally just a half life mod shows that you don't need to spend a fortune to make a great game
8906	1	a	its a good game all should play it :)
8908	1	a	Bets In the world!
8910	1	a	I love this game. I think it's way better than the others CSS or GO.
8912	1	a	Very Very amazing game it wasent voted for most popular online shooter for no reason.

8944	1	a	Old school game !
8946	1	a	.
8948	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
8950	1	a	If u want to learn to play this game all over again after one week break.  Go ahead
8952	1	a	I played it for a while, died a lot and didn't kill anyone, but I had a damn good time doing it.
8954	1	a	Basically the best competitive FPS of all time  If you don't already have 10,000 hours invested then it's probably not worth playing
8956	1	a	such a nice game :D
8958	1	a	Dis is great nad there is still player online! and if you can play CS:GO! its great!
8960	1	a	screen problems.. it is sucking up.. can't put back the screen in original way after it gotten wider.. no opption at all.
8962	1	a	Best game of all times.  Hope it will have Match making system like CS:GO with a bit better graphics.
8964	1	a	Very good thx
8966	1	a	I really need help. Why do i have 4 fps?  Windows 8.1
8968	1	a	This game is a genuine classic. Grew up with it. Got over 600 hours on it. Loved almost every moment of it (except when I got killed by aim-bot and wallers) but oterwise a great buy. It has its perks and like a trillion mods of which I'd say 25% are running at any given time from servers worldwide. Definitely recommend it to players who like oldschool games.
8970	1	a	I guess it's okay, I haven't played it all that much tho
8972	1	a	...
8974	1	a	itÂ´s a good game for haters
8976	1	a	Truely The EVERGREEN game of all FPS games. Worth playing over and over again.
8978	1	a	We won't forget..
8980	1	a	Goes for like a $, Just buy it.
8982	1	a	:)))
8984	1	a	:)
8986	1	a	Toy for da black guys.
8988	1	a	Great and awesome game :)
8990	1	a	:)
8992	1	a	where it all started for counter strike
8994	1	a	This Is One Of The Best FPS Game`s I Have Ever Played.
8996	1	a	Sceneplayers ~
8998	1	a	its funny and u can play multiplayer and lan enjoy :)
9000	1	a	played this game for too long. it has a special place in my heart
9002	1	a	Simply legend
9004	1	a	old school game still has the fast paced
9006	1	a	Simply just one of the best Tactical fps games out there. Any one that want to buy it buy it. Well its old but its better then new games in 2015. Skill based playing and over all fun game to play i would say 7/10
9008	1	a	Taught me the Spanish Language Would gladly 'chingate!' Translate: (â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Off!) Again! 10/10 for this classic
9010	1	a	That game will never die. You might think it's old and unpopular but then you're wrong. Try this out if you're not do that before.
9012	1	a	Best multi play fps ever. ever... dont buy if you have kids or a wife/gf or a job or a life.
9014	1	a	very very nice game :v
9016	1	a	It's old but very good game!
9018	1	a	because they the best classics
9020	1	a	the one and only best game ever
9022	1	a	You see an enemy... pew...pew...pew...pew... you die with a headshoot... :D
9024	1	a	I played this game for a few years and it made me puke constantly and have bloody diarrhea every day. 10/10 A++++++ would play again
9026	1	a	Cs its one of the best games ever , simply! 10/10
9028	1	a	i did a mlg 420 noscop and 2 qiukscops and my gf br0k3 up wif me cux of this gam3 10/10 wont reccomend
9030	1	a	I don't know. There isn't much to say here. One of the biggest FPS games out there right now. Still popular and you can still find CW + PUGs in IRC for 1.6. Definitely a welcome alternative between CSGO games.
9032	1	a	Very cool game!
9034	1	a	ALL TIME BEST FPS SHOOTER !!! TILL NOW ^_^
9036	1	a	Still an epic
9038	1	a	:) :*
9040	1	a	BES GAYM EVAR mlgquickscopsmokeweederryday420doritosmountaindew2014m8
9042	1	a	This game has no skins it only 100/10 would bang :(
9044	1	a	I donâ€™t believe there is any gamer out there who doesnâ€™t know Counter-Strike. It took CS a long way of over 10 years to reach the point where it is right now. And certainly CS 1.6 played the leading part in this adventure. This game is the closest to be the father of all FPS games. It is not as old as Wolfenstein and does not have beastly graphics like Battlefield but CS 1.6 did not need those aspects to have a special place amongst all games. This is more than a game, this is the timeline where moments of joy, rage, cries and laughs of all players are stored.
9046	1	a	God, I am bad at Counter Strike...  But still this game is one of the most played games ever, and for a reason. It is simple and just works.  The graphics are no longer anywhere near modern graphics, but that doesn't matter.  
9048	1	a	Nice game
9050	1	a	Still the 5th best games evar and still better than Call Of Doody!
9052	1	a	Very good game and the community is huge and is very active for a game so old yet so fun.
9054	1	a	learning more spanish everyday 10/10 si si
9056	1	a	OK !~
9058	1	a	I shoot the guns.
9060	1	a	Can't go wrong with this classic.
9062	1	a	Very nice game
9064	1	a	Nice game !!!!
9066	1	a	The BEST FPS Game to get addicted with &lt;3
9068	1	a	Nice Voice of Fire in the hole Simulator
9070	1	a	BEST GAME!

9074	1	a	Where it all began!
9076	1	a	fire in the hole fire in the hole fire in the hole  
9078	1	a	Its counter strike ffs ;)
9080	1	a	It was fun. I like this. 
9082	1	a	I remember playing this game a LOT 10+ yrs ago and it is still being played today, not as much as the current CS GO and not as much as back then, but it has stood the test of time none the less.
9084	1	a	Best FPS of all time.
9086	1	a	Great game!
9088	1	a	My childhood's game .
9090	1	a	4 years .. one game -_-
9092	1	a	Forever Popular ^^
9094	1	a	Waste of Time
9096	1	a	Very fun. but make sure you got opengl or you're out of luck!
9098	1	a	actually this was a good game back in 2011 i played this a lot and i love this
9100	1	a	Convince yourself how much fun you're having through all of the frustration.  Be thankful that there are way better hitboxes here than in CS: GO, and less latency issues.  Join a random server that's modded to play...football?!...and play for 2 hours doing nothing but chasing and pouncing other players because you have no idea how to play the mod.   Classic CS.
9102	1	a	pretty awesome 
9104	1	a	No words to review to years i play this game tells everything about it. If wasnt worth it, for sure i wouldnt have played it for so long.
9106	1	a	My childhood is here  ALL of it &lt;3
9108	1	a	Classic game I still enjoy It
9110	1	a	BOOM HEADSHOT!
9112	1	a	Counter Strike one of the best series of games.This is the best part of the series.This isn't the game which has high graphics or is realistic but to be honest it is very addicting.  No negative reviews about the game...Just amazing.  'Recommended'.
9114	1	a	i think this game is one of the best games what ever coded in the written history
9116	1	a	its awesome game
361	0	a	The devs must be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, 2015 and take a look at the graphic... 2/10
9118	1	a	The best Counter Strike Version ever created!
9120	1	a	Simply, the best game ever.
9122	1	a	  I have played this game for about 4 years now and it never gets old, its the greatest online multiplayer ever in my opinion. This game is absolutely addicting and more original than anything I've ever played. Hell even the user created game modes and maps are great. The maps cs_assault and de_dust 1 and 2 are classics. Every video game developer should look to Counter-Strike as an example when making a multiplayer. The game has so much variety, it can be ridiculously difficult it just depends on who you're playing with..
9124	1	a	It's an incredible game, best first person shooter game ever. You have all the action you need everywhere, and you can have fun playing it with your friends. Try it!
9126	1	a	Best game ever made 4 sure addicted
9128	1	a	Best Game for all Time!!!

9156	1	a	Obvious clone of CSGO
9158	1	a	One cannot call themselves a true Counter-Strike fan without playing this at least once.  10/10 I recommend it to anyone who loves the later Counter-Strike games.
9160	1	a	Hi, I do not know why I recently went on CS 1.6 and gave me VAC banned from secure server when I connected to a server, what happened?
9162	1	a	Awesome Game I Ever Played! &lt;3 Counter-Strike Is life :* !
9164	1	a	Great game, this is an all time classic for pc gaming, the skill you need in this game is what what makes it great and unique...... but the community these days is not very supportive of new players, they downright hate them, oh and get ready for constant and annoying crashes.
9166	1	a	Best cs so far !
9168	1	a	it doesnt need mouse if you have laptop touchpad
9170	1	a	A great game. I recommend!

9180	1	a	Classic :)
9182	1	a	The good old classic. Counter-Strike 1.6. It is perhaps one of the most important FPS game in history when it comes to competitive FPS. Using the same recipe today in the newest installment of the Counter-Strike series.

9242	1	a	Best game. Period.
9244	1	a	Awesome, best 1st person shooter game ever.. This game proves gfx doesn't matter gameplay does :p
9246	1	a	the grandfather, the grandaddy, the big cheese of FPS games, this game in particular paved the way for modern FPS games.  this game created some of the most innovative players in FPS games of all time, some of the most fun custom maps ever made by man, the most popular maps made by NIPPER, there was nothing like driving jeeps off a death defying jump over a chasm only to crash and do flips while somone is playing music over the microphone with HLSS.  this was the game of generations, of people's childhoods, millions of hours spent end on end.  buy this game, play it online, play it at lan parties as much as you can, while you can, it's heyday has long passed, and everyone misses it, but there will always be someone wanting to, or actually playing the game.  just make sure you play NIPPER's maps as well.

9310	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 is game best for action.
9312	1	a	I want that badge
9314	1	a	I can have 14 years old, 30 years old, have even 90 years old, and it wont get bored play Counter - Strike, the best part, that every PC can run CS, and it is pretty good, even with the time that got created, i love CS, you basiclly, can play everything, CTF, Normal, Warzone, etc.  I highly recommend to buy Counter Strike.
9316	1	a	Do you ever feel that nostalgic feeling when you played the game and you remembered how it felt the first time you played it?
9318	1	a	iTS rEallY a fAntastic gAmE to PLay
9320	1	a	Best game ever, the graphics may not be the best, BUT WHO CARES, I still love it as hell!
9322	1	a	Best FPS game of all the time,the one that started it all aswell with the competitive scene.
9324	1	a	I have been playing this game since 4-5 years now... not bored even now... the mods present in the game . the different models that can be downloaded.. its competitiveness... make it a game worth buying eve now after this many years of its release... WARNING.. dont buy thios game u wont see sunlight again.. :p 
9326	1	a	i cannot play because this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 'The game waas actived with a product code that is vailid only in a specifig geographic region. since you are not currently in that region, counter strike is not avaible to play' :(    pls help meeee i already was disable beta updates but nothing :(
9328	1	a	Cool
9330	1	a	The one and only. Back when games had simple mechanics and very little nonsense. Remember when a bullet would go where you actually fired it? Remember when recoil patterns were easy to understand? Remember when it was possible to take a game seriously and become ridiculously good at it?  The Counter-Strike franchise is very much like Super Smash Bros -- they had Brawl, we had CS:Source and CS:GO. Let's hope VALVe decides to play a proper homage to this game in the future much like Nintendo did with the New Smash Bros.
9332	1	a	the best
9334	1	a	Is a good game....I love him !
9336	1	a	what can u say it is osm &lt;3
9338	1	a	Even though it came out over 10 years ago it is still a great game to play and the servers are filled with lots of players and the community lives on. I would recomend this game to anyone.
9340	1	a	Classic 1.6, the true Counter Strike.

9360	1	a	Nice game !!!!!!!!!!
9362	1	a	One of the best Counter-Strike games in my opinion. Dying out, but still worth playing.
9364	1	a	Where it all began.
9366	1	a	more then 5 years play this game
9368	1	a	..
9370	1	a	best FPS game of all time
9372	1	a	Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.  There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!  In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!
9374	1	a	Very good game if you like to be a non stop killing machine
9376	1	a	cool game it's very fantastic
9378	1	a	Probably the most played game in the old days.  Epic gameplay, not so epic graphics, but tons of fun and joy for hours. 10/10
9380	1	a	Best experience for a gaming start... enjoy it with care ;)
9382	1	a	good game even though it is an older game still has many players 10/10 would get quickscoped again
9384	1	a	
9386	1	a	Best old school game
9388	1	a	Even after 14 years this game is still going strong (and is full of hackers) I rate 8/8
9390	1	a	A classic in the genre. Still a lot of players playing it. Not the best looking multiplayer FPS out there, but very fun to play.
9392	1	a	It was fun for the little that I played it, is this game active anymore?
9394	1	a	Boom Headshot -5
9396	1	a	Best shooting game ever made. Period
9398	1	a	I grew up playing this game and I'm still playing it. This game will never die.   Things i like about this game.
9400	1	a	ah, the beauty of old gaming remains. this game is more than just 'alive and kicking', even though it's old by now. it's a nice game which focus more on skill and reflexes than cute graphics and advanced functions. if you like fast-paced shooter you'll probably like this one too.  there's lots of mods, addons and maps out there... since this is an older game which allow people to create their own through 3rd-party software. in my opinion, that alone make this game awesome.
9402	1	a	Classic game. It's great. What more can I say? 9/10. Everyone should own this.
9404	1	a	This is Realy Amazing CS
9406	1	a	I will miss...
9408	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing!  Even though the graphics are not one of the best but still the game gained popularity. If you will know how to play counter-strike it will be easy for you to play other games. And there is no game like Counter-strike ( in my opinion) that will give you pleasure when you are doing 5 kills and all are headshots And I'm 100 % sure that this game is a LEGEND!!! 
9410	1	a	Piece of Art
9412	1	a	cuz its cool :)
9414	1	a	Dont have words for that game.. best childhood memories there :)
9416	1	a	This Game is old, but Gold. A great example of FPS game. Really it is. Especially When you bring your Friends into this Game. *Recommended*
9418	1	a	Awsome game!
9420	1	a	In my opinion, should be like Â£2.99 not Â£6.99, and there is no achievments
9422	1	a	Though the tournaments may be over for this game, its still crazy fun to play... its really hard to explain it but youll know that this here is own of the greatests FPS games of all time. 
9424	1	a	maybe the graphics are not the best, BUT this is a great game!  
9426	1	a	
9428	1	a	No I don't recommend this game, I just bored when I wrote this recommandation.
9430	1	a	The game is great, if you can find a server that isnt Dust_2 where everyone rushes long A.
9432	1	a	I like this game
9434	1	a	
9436	1	a	Still a good game.
9438	1	a	a legendary game

9582	1	a	still the best fps thereÂ´s ever been
9584	1	a	One of the first FPS games I played and still do for fun. I have allot of memories with the game, made allot of friends and lost allot of friends. But in the end it was all worth it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
9586	1	a	deathmach
9588	1	a	When I was a kid I grew up as a console player playing ps2 and xbox, never having the chance to play the original Counter Strike. A few months ago I bought CSGO and I now have well over 200 hours. I decided to buy the original so I could see what it was like before csgo, although I could hardly find a server and I have hardly played it I really enjoy it.
9590	1	a	Pretty Nice Game ^^
9592	1	a	Great game, but doesn't let me open it 90% of the time
9594	1	a	The good one, without screaming scrubs like in CS-GO
9596	1	a	This game is AMAZZIINGG :D
9598	1	a	???
9600	1	a	Buy It.
9602	1	a	+++++++++
9604	1	a	Classic :)
9606	1	a	I recommend this old but still one of the best FPS Shooter ever made... Counter-Strike 1.6 is still played by Professional Teams like: SK Gaming, Fnatic, Lunatic Hai, mTw, Na'Vi and more... If you like Fun &amp; Action, Counter-Strike is the right game for you...
9608	1	a	So many good memories with this game. A LAN party classic. I'm old... get off my lawn
9610	1	a	+
9612	1	a	used to be great but waaaaayyyy too many cheaters now...............unfortunately
9614	1	a	Classic FPS that started steam.
9616	1	a	This goes without saying, if you care about anything in the past two decades PC gaming related, you're going to play CS.
9618	1	a	It's a classic. 
9620	1	a	Aaah, keep spending so much money on this game hahaha, love it though
9622	1	a	Clasic. Have been playing since i was 8 years old and will continue.
9624	1	a	Counter Strike is undoubtable one of the greatest first person shooters of all time. while good servers may be harder to find nowadays, it still remains great.
9626	1	a	.
9628	1	a	simply the best ever
9630	1	a	10/10
9632	1	a	Nice and n1
9634	1	a	Only one word..INSANE!
9636	1	a	For those new players that bought this game with a bundle of CSGO. All I have to say that this game was a mod of the original Valve IP Half life. So everything from that game was brought over. Just play this game with a grain of salt if you are used to actually good hit detection and decent graphics
9638	1	a	:)
9640	1	a	;)
9642	1	a	Back in the early days of steam, this was litrally the only game I owned.. I sunk my life into it.
9644	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldnâ€™t find the stupid cake.
9646	1	a	Water
9648	1	a	
9650	1	a	cool game!
9652	1	a	Spent way over a thousand hours in this game back in the day. 10/10
9654	1	a	This is a great FPS. I've spent many hours playing this game even before it was on Steam.   Recommended to anyone who has not played this classic.  10/10 Would have my mom bring me McDonald's while playing for freakin' days again.
9656	1	a	Harder Than Cs:Go !
9658	1	a	!
9660	1	a	This Game is GOOD
9662	1	a	Old but still Gold.
9664	1	a	This is a great game, made in 2000 and still has a reasonably high amount of players. definitely recommend buying.
9666	1	a	Good memories
9668	1	a	Old but gold
9670	1	a	THE REAL CLASSIC!!!
9672	1	a	Why did i got VAC ban for not having CS: GO ? U baned me for cheating in CS: GO + I dont haw CS:GO!!! that lame Steam ... Just taking money from kids, and thats all .
9674	1	a	:))
9676	1	a	Its classic
9678	1	a	I love this game is the best Game in the world
9680	1	a	cs and also a wild shootout
9682	1	a	COUNTER STRÄ°KE 1.6 SÃœPER BÄ°R OYUN TAVSÄ°YE EDERÄ°M
9684	1	a	best game ever even it's graphics are low as compared to now. &lt;3 1.6
9686	1	a	Best game ever, Never have I ever been so attached to this. I get nostalgia of this game back when I played on my Dad's Computer. 10/10 This game is life.
9688	1	a	something different.
9690	1	a	More people need to go back to 1.6!
9692	1	a	Even after all these years still sort of fun, when you look past all of the insta-killers and quickscopers and the large community of hackers.   
9694	1	a	FIRE IN THE HOLE
9696	1	a	who said it was dead, there may only be like 30 servers, but they're always teeming
9698	1	a	The classic, the legend, still a good game after far over a century.
9700	1	a	CS 1.6 will outlive CS:GO. Or any other game, for that matter :)
9702	1	a	!!!!!!
9704	1	a	When counter-strike was not about MONEY
9706	1	a	The undisputed king of multiplayer fps games, never gets old.
9708	1	a	+
9710	1	a	Best FPS ever created !
9712	1	a	Way more entertaining than counter strike global offensive.
9714	1	a	I love how fast the game works even with a low prosser the game looks so good for sure I recomend it.
9716	1	a	 Joins server. Joins Counter-Terrorists  'Oh finally a classic server I can play on'.  Group of Spanish talking players starts yelling at me. Gets banned permanently  'Amazing'  11/10 - Best game experience ever. If you don't speak Spanish, it's going to be a rough time.
9718	1	a	all started from here, everyone must try this before u play in latest versions :D
9720	1	a	I bought it a round Sept in about 2006 in a Box Platem Edtion Serrie Pud. I put it a way , I have sleves in my Orange Box.
9722	1	a	this was probably the best fps game on earth. But now there is COD fishes dominating the land, This is not COD fish land this is Counter strike! but there is alot of old nice people and they like you and be nice to you (nottrue) i might not have alot of hours or none on steam but i played alot when it first came out, Holy moly was there alot of COD fish there but atleast there is less COD fish, Right but there is alot of nostalgia inbeded in it, low res is bad for some but for me i love it because it was alot of hard work making that game at the time, Now it would take 3 weeks like CSNZ but this was the best fps in the history of mankind, and it will always be,
9724	1	a	The memories :)
9726	1	a	why I cant play cs on win10 ? wtf ????
9728	1	a	Best game ever! Been playing this game since 2007 and I am still in love with it, I'm in love with every CS game!
9730	1	a	An old game with a small but lively community, most of the servers that are populated are either filled with spanish speakers or russians. but there are some amarican servers *cough means slaugherhouse Cough*  if you dont wanna deal with that get the zbot mod for bots in offline servers.   otherwise a great skill bases shooter. lots of maps have been lost in this game that hasnt surfaced in later releases. but the main few still live on, for better or worse. (lookin at you cs_assault)  8/10
9732	1	a	i love the game but there is alot of people that dont speak english which sucks if you dont speak other languages but english dont talk :)
9734	1	a	This cost me my highschool :DDDDDDDDDDDDDD
9736	1	a	Ignore that my steam account only has 8.7 hours, I've played much longer than that, trust me.  Anyway... Counter-Strike. This game is awesome. I've seen a lot of reviews that say it's dead, but considering the fact that theres about 8,000 people playing at once each day, I can safely say they are wrong. 1.6 is a true competitive shooter, and this (and CZ because they are basically the same) is my favourite and will be known as the best of its series.  Keep this in mind though; this game is HARD. You can't just hop in and kill everyone. No matter if you're some professional CS:GO global elite, if you haven't played this game before, you WILL suck. Deal with it. This game is a lot different to its other titles (Apart from CZ) and when played feels like an almost different game. It's harder than the others and should stay that way.  Only downside is that nobody plays simple server PUGs anymore, so I may have to sign up to ESEA (not free), but it's probably worth it. Remember this game is harder, if you start on this and get good, then you will be even better on GO.   Trust me, if you play 1.6 then go onto CS:GO, it's a breeze.  BUY THIS GAME AND PLAY IT.
9738	1	a	Who doesn't like pixeled polygons from 1999?
9740	1	a	awsome game
9742	1	a	This game is awesome
9744	1	a	Classic games are the best, i am having a lot of fun on this game and i will continue to play this game. 1.6 is amazing!
9746	1	a	this game is a wonderful coop and multiplayer game  the best game that was played of most players in 2000 - 2007 
9748	1	a	If you havent played Counter Strike you're not a gamer!
9750	1	a	Greatest FPS of all time, need I say more?
9752	1	a	Best Game in The World :D
9754	1	a	i cant even aim at all for some reason the game wont let me look around or anything i cant turn my head what kind of counter strike is this (edit) i know this game led to what is now csgo which is really fun but if i cant even play the right way on the game that started the worlds number 1 online action game then theres a problem
9756	1	a	This is an amazing game, i am playing this game since i was 7 years old. Yup it's quite old but gameplay with friends make this game really special. !!!
9758	1	a	1.6 
9760	1	a	great game to play with friends
9762	1	a	The best of best GAMES!  ever!
9764	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ shield.

9782	1	a	best of the best :)
9784	1	a	No matter how good you become (CSGO), always remember where you started.
9786	1	a	Best Game cince the release
9788	1	a	The game.
9790	1	a	CLASSIC ! THE BEST PVP EVER
9792	1	a	Always come back for the nostalgia.
9794	1	a	I love the counter strike whole series it's very skill developing and entertaining game.  
9796	1	a	Two words for this game - F*cking awesome.   Been playing this game for almost 3 years and never got bored out of it. Every single day I learnt more &amp; more about the game, and still learning. This game way grips you with simple yet effective gameplay, which you will hardly or rarely find in any FPS games nowadays.  This game is the Father of all CS versions. If you are a CS:GO player and haven't played CS 1.6, then you are missing the most amazing thing.   TRY IT &amp; GET ADDICTED!
9798	1	a	Best Multiplayer Game I Hv Ever Played ^_-
9800	1	a	Old but gold, highly recommend it.
9802	1	a	This games takes me back to childhood. So nostalgic
9804	1	a	It's ok, I guess ..
9806	1	a	Oops, i wrote this review by accident, sorry!
9808	1	a	Nice games
9810	1	a	Classic game. Thanks for all the fun
9812	1	a	Hands down the best shooter ever made. Completely balanced and not tampered with.
9814	1	a	Just csgo with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ies graphics and less Russians
9816	1	a	Recommend............
9818	1	a	Great game
9820	1	a	who hate this game?!
9822	1	a	where do you find the servers to play mulitplayer?
9824	1	a	'CS 1.6' Old but Gold !
9826	1	a	Its like csgo but with no skins.
9828	1	a	It is Counter-Strike, of course it's good.
9830	1	a	Really nice game you can back to old school ;D
9832	1	a	My childhood game. It's one of the best games i've ever played !
9834	1	a	 Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. 
9836	1	a	When you play CS:GO and then you remember the GoldSrc engine and the sprays... I think a flashlight too.  Then you realize - Everyone on 1.6 will most likely kick your â™¥â™¥â™¥ no matter how good your rig is. Get it if you like getting your â™¥â™¥â™¥ beat by people you will assume are hackers (when they're usually not) or have a crappy computer and want to get good at FPS's.
9838	1	a	2012-2014:   awsome classic game changing shooter    2015: Unfortunately this game sucks now. I can not find a server that hasn't got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that kick you for trying to play the damn game! Also almost half! of the servers are filled with annoying germens or russians and the other half either have no one in the server or have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s as described above.  But i still recommend this game it is amazing and if the graphics aren't good enough for you go get counter strike source or counter strike global offensive.  but its best if you just get counter strike source if you want servers without jerks and a game without empty servers.
9840	1	a	Its alot smoothest with new update 10/10
9842	1	a	Awesome game! Lot's of fun, especially when playing with friends.
9844	1	a	A game that still exist after 15 years, what else do you need?
9846	1	a	ZAMBIES ! 2spooky4me zombie mod 2/10 Esport 2/10 Fun 2/10 Teamwork ??? THER IS NO TEAMWORK  
9848	1	a	Alright so I don't think I have enough hours as these guys out here but I have to say this game is fantastic. I came from playing Counter Strike Go so it was a drastic change of pase. I am having so much fun playing this game I have not been this ecstatic playing a game in a long time but this game gets me so hyped up. It just comes to show how amazing Counter Strike as a franchise is.
9850	1	a	the best of the best
9852	1	a	Just Awesome  
9854	1	a	The Best Of Games
9856	1	a	Its a classic game
9858	1	a	15 years too late tbh smh btw
9860	1	a	Best shooter game ever
9862	1	a	One of the best games left for old PC's. Doesn't lag, fun to play
9864	1	a	Eh, its not bad...
9866	1	a	5/5
9868	1	a	Game of the millenium &lt;3
9870	1	a	It's been 15 years since release and this is the only game I can come back to every day and never get bored. The best game. Forever.
9872	1	a	the only game that i love the most ! &lt;3 xoxo
9874	1	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing great
9876	1	a	Most played multiplayer game !
9878	1	a	Can't express enough how much this game has impacted the life and community of FPS gamers all around the world. Love it so much, and still enjoy playing it til this day. I feel bad I didn't play it online when I was younger, only played LAN at friends houses. lol
9880	1	a	So this game was LEGEN, wait for it, DARY. I miss the wallbangs so much in Counter-Strike Global Offensive and not only the that but all that Counter Strike 1.6 has provided to my childhood.
9882	1	a	There's nothing more to be said. It's a legend. After more than a decade this game is still favourite multiplayer FPS for millions of players.
9884	1	a	The Best Steam Game of all Time!
9886	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. The Beta version was released in 1999 and the full version released in 2000.  To tell you the truth i really love this game, it gave me a nice experience and always when i see this game in my inventory im gettin on the feel train.  Nice wars, pub matches, these are good memories, when we had a little group of kids, teenagers, adults, the age did not matter when we were in game.   Sadly that's the past, and a lot of players still playing this game nowadays, but the fact is this game got ruined, no, its not the time and the old graphics, and the new series of counter strike. This happened because the hackers, yes i hate them, i don't know why is it so funny or cool... it's sad.   I'm not going to say Pros and Cons, this game is a collector piece today.  Totally worth for the price if the graphics doesn't matter, and you want to play with an antique game.    -LK's Score 9/10 (postscript: -1 because of the hackers)
9888	1	a	10/10 Game. Would Fire in the Hole again.
9890	1	a	Amazing game. recommend it
9892	1	a	Well the best childhood game! Feels nostalgia when I play. Its been 5 years since last time I played this. From past six months I've been playing. But recently purchased! LOL

9904	1	a	Nice Game..  High Quallity Specs Will Lead to Memorable Gaming :)  Currently Status :  Losing Its Grip Due To DDOS :(
9906	1	a	game free =)
9908	1	a	It's like pleasuring a woman with your hand, your fingers get tired, your wrist starts to hurt but you just have to keep going.  11/10
9910	1	a	One of The best Lan based ,multiplayer ,First Person Shooter game.Highly Recommended by me if you wanna do a lan party at home make it your first choice. And if you have a high end spec pc then go with its next version CS:GO.
9912	1	a	I have played a lot of this game outside of steam and it is one of the best first person shooters out there, obviously you can go with CSGO now as it is much bigger and more supported (although valve are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥) but it is fun every now and then to go into a server on 1.6 and have fun with the better movement and gun control, although don't get used to it as CSGO will never adopt something similar.
9914	1	a	1337
9916	1	a	Recommended
9918	1	a	Everyone speaks spanish 10/10
9920	1	a	Classic but at this point you're better off getting source. Lets me take out terrorists in the comfort of my own home.
9922	1	a	cs4life ..
9924	1	a	it's really cool game! u can be one of ten pimps and have a big disco club!
9926	1	a	Old school games are the best^^
9928	1	a	miss this game
9930	1	a	Very good and nice game. Played it for 7 years:)
9932	1	a	Being a player only thing I can say is.. 'RESPECT' Go hell with Far Cry or GTA or Even any FPS . CS 1.6 RoxXxX.... \o/
9934	1	a	Simple and funy...
9936	1	a	It's still a classic.
9938	1	a	This game...so perfect!  My reason to love FPS.  :)
9940	1	a	the original is still the best. if you think your good at shooters. play with the veterans of this game and they will school you so hard you will want to put you fist through your screen. but like a martial arts master they will teach you the ways and you will eventually become more then you could have possibly imagine.
9942	1	a	20 hours in just 2 days? Yeah I need to stop...  10/10 what is life
9944	1	a	CSGO Is good game but for Kids, But CS1.6? CS1.6 is Legendary Game :) &lt;3
9946	1	a	didnt play this game on steam but only the cracked one, But its cool and i don't know why i can review this ?
9948	1	a	A Legendary FPS Game!!! &lt;3
9950	1	a	I used to love this game, now, outdated it still is pretty fun
9952	1	a	Some of the most fun i have had in a game in a while
9954	1	a	Classic. I like to play a round sometimes but I think CS:GO is better in almost all aspects. Would recommend to buy in a sale   You should like old graphics tho.
9956	1	a	Nothing can beat the original, except for being dead.  I want ye glorious days of olde to come back.
9958	1	a	God game allthough old!
9960	1	a	Old school but cool.
9962	1	a	:)
9964	1	a	I like this game
9966	1	a	good old classic 1.6 would love to see it make a come back
9968	1	a	Greatest game ever
9970	1	a	It's ok
9972	1	a	Great!
9974	1	a	Nothing beats the classic
9976	1	a	Ok Counter Strike. Where do I even begin?  This is where it all started. I have always been a 1.6 player. My old accoint that had over 7,500 hours on it was lost, due to me forgetting the password. I took a break for a couple of years, realizing that CS was slowly taking away my life. Well, I am back, and would of never thought to be in this position. I tried CS:GO, but... eh. The ranks and skins and little kids kind of ruined it for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but doesn't neccesarily give me the true feeling of Counter Strike. Went back into this game a few years later, and realize the community is filled with nudity, the game has people raging in different laguages, and... hackers. That was until I found servers that were english; servers with admins watching it. And I said to myself, 'Oh â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Here we go again'.
9978	1	a	:)
9980	1	a	Great game gg
9982	1	a	This is the greatest FPS in the world yeah!
9984	1	a	Nice game !
9986	1	a	This is the best game I played in my life!
9988	1	a	Really noob friendly. Great community. Swag.
9990	1	a	Where the CS veterans thrive and live on.
9992	1	a	:-)
9994	1	a	Grab your MP5, a smoke grenade, your K-bar and a flash bang. You've got work to do!
9996	1	a	A good shooter game. Can run with a 'bad' computer, and every russian server has no players.
9998	1	a	This Game , is The best you can get. Let's us to make friends , and makes brotherhood between us &lt;3 But the recent â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hackers which have joined has made it hard and annoying. But this game will live forever. &lt;3
364	0	a	randomly removed itself from my library
365	0	a	Not worthy 20 fps i know its made 2000 but if you want to play on good servers with good old felling play source!
366	0	a	The game is aged and very broken...
367	0	a	Too many cheaters.
368	0	a	Great game if you like old school shooters. If you dont (like me) you shouldnt buy it and should buy the global offensive. I personaly struggled to find servers, and when I did, I saw the admins flying everyvhere
369	0	a	Still better than CS:GO
370	0	a	Unfortunately the publisher destroyed the original game on purpose to finally be able to be successful with a sequel, the terrible CS:GO. I don't like CS:GO and now CS 1.6 on Steam is unplayable.
371	0	a	meh even though i have 1000 plus hours on csgo but not fun
372	0	a	This game runs like dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on my pc.  Specs: Toaster 2 toast holes dual burners crumb tray  easy lock system Heat controll for perfect toast
373	0	a	Ehh it's not bad at all, played a 'few' hours with it, the reason why I'm not recommending this game is actually because I've been receiving or am being kicked for..  Reason: Fake Client. etc blah blah blah  Don't have any ways to resolve this issue, and I might make a 'YES' recommendation once I get it fixed.   One more thing, when I mean I DON'T RECOMMEND this, I mean, you can buy this game and it's up to you, cuz I probs played this game since aged 7 or sumthin, But play it on yer own risk.
374	0	a	this game need â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in fix !!!! every time i click on a key it sends me to other server or reopen the server
375	0	a	Stopped working and cannot find help
376	0	a	There is a bug in the game. 8/10 times config file gets reset and I have to change all the settings and console commands back to my comfort again.Very disappointing :(
377	0	a	Only played by s p i c s
378	0	a	This game lies in ruins...  I remember when in the past I used to play this game it used to be a lot more fun. But now, on each and every server you will find atleast 2 cheater using aimbot and wallhack. Also on every server there are always people who are using the non-steam i.e. pirated version of this game. If that's not enough steam is VAC banning the innocents like me. I was playing this game on a deathrun server , barely 7 days from the day I had brought this game. My router went off for a second and when it was back on I saw that I had been VAC banned. Reason : Cheating inflaction. How the hell do you use cheat on a deathrun server ?! And one more thing : The steam guys say that VAC BAN is delayed and takes time , then how the hell did it BAN me in just 31 hours of gameplay ?  Hope this review has helped you in getting a better view of the game.  I have got many games for free from this group :  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Accidently  . It's an awesome group and I would recommend you to join it if you like to get games for free.
379	0	a	wow me vac banned not problems.. Buying play today.. Vacban too.. OMG
380	0	a	  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cheaters -_-
381	0	a	ban vac security for use auto bunny in a jailbreak ._. 
382	0	a	Its good I guess. But the community ruined it, just buy Asheron's Call instead.
383	0	a	this is my childhood game, but seeing it this way hurts me, most of the keys i am using during playing the game as everyone does, leads me to some servers and stuff, wtf is this? i can't spray, i cant chrouch and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. if anyone knows how to fix this pls tell me how
384	0	a	iM So Fuxkinqqq High Men
385	0	a	would be nicer if people actually â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing played vanilla cs and not this deathmatch â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, one of the prime reasons i bought this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
386	0	a	  it was my best game but now if full cheaters and they dont giving a vac ban cuz it will be a bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pfffff
387	0	a	  it was my best game but now if full cheaters and they dont giving a vac ban cuz it will be a bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pfffff
388	0	a	This game was the best one out there, but not anymore. (Because of the players online)  If you want to play Free For All or something like that, tough â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ nobody plays that anymore.  If you want to play Zombies, you won't get very far at all, people play it, but all of them are stubborn, picky, pieces of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, if you do not meet their expectations you will be instantly kicked, or the host will end the session. Same goes with if you host a lobby, the same stubborn picky pieces of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ will leave immediately.  A thing I noticed is that if no one hacks in the lobby, the lobby will end because the hosts just want hacks, little 10 year olds only play the game to 'hack'  So basically the game is so dead to the point where people no longer want to play the game how it is, they want to play a modded version of it, and that if you don't hack, you're too low and you'll be kicked.  So only buy this game if you plan to play solo or with your friends, because everybody else online is an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  If you already bought this game, instantly go request a refund like me.
389	0	a	I just played a few rounds of Team Deathmatch on multiplayer, and good god was I disappointed. I played the Xbox 360 version back in 2012 and either the game has aged worse than I thought possible, or the PC version's multiplayer has been stripped down to the bare minimum, especially when compared to the console version There's little-to-no HUD, the map keeps disappearing and reappearing, the controls are wonky and simplistic, and really, it felt like I was playing an online FPS from 2002 as opposed to 2008. I for one, am NOT a happy camper for sinking half of a steam card into this....
390	0	a	wont even open for me fix this bug or i want my money back!
391	0	a	Once a great game, now just appauling. 100% due to it's age and lack of a community, Hardly even worth a review as I'll be refunding it.  So instead I'll share my thoughts of the console version which I played for years upon release.  Great visuals and an awesome story (in terms of Call of Duty stories that is) Multiplayer is a huge success and brings hours and hours of enjoyment with the usual prestige system they've got going.  Overall this was one of my more favoured COD experienced.  I'd give this game a 8/10 I'll just urge you all not to bother buying it anymore as the playerbase is basically nothing.

393	0	a	this game is aids. i got this game for for 1 reason, to play CZ with my friends. but when i invite him it says 'the game in no longer avalible' i have spent days trying to fix this but theres nothing. i want my money back. haha but wait i have played it for more then 2 hrs. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. solo is good tho
394	0	a	Do not buy CoD. This is and extremely un-balanced game, is even more so old, AND is far to expensive for it's age.
395	0	a	I feel like the CoD games are like the black sheep on Steam. All the other better games are like 'hey guys 90% off', meanwhile this ancient game is still charging 10 dollars, and has been for years. -_-
396	0	a	Very upset with this game. It doesn't let me host private servers with my friends and it doesnt let me play nazi zombies with my friends. I expected more from it but i was let down smh....
397	0	a	im not sure if its the game or steam itself but when ever i try to launch the game is fails to open.i have spent money on a game that does not work please either help me or give me a refund.  
398	0	a	i love the game but it wont let me play it anymore because when i try to open it it says that its already open but its not
399	0	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥ and you cant start it because theres a glitch
400	0	a	Co-op does not work.  Here is a link to a discussion that show that this problem has been around for years and affected multiple people:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/10090/discussions/0/828925849447229962/ 
401	0	a	Unable to create multiplayer account, if activision really cared about fixing this back in 2013 this wouldnt be an issue.  Yes, ive tried every fix without any luck.
402	0	a	I would reccomend this game if it were possible to play multiplayer. But its not sadly.
403	0	a	Cant even create an online profile, you rock activishit.
404	0	a	Not for me. I liked some of the CoD games, especially for their mixture of some story and action, but this game has too much repetitive action, and the AI is just bad. Enemies screaming 'Banzai' and then charging at you from the other side of the map. wtf?   Not to mention the somewhat weird, almost elusive story. It's just random short episodes of random soldiers throughout the war. I fail to see the golden threat. And the heavy Allies bias is somewhat annoying. We get it, they 'won' the war. The game just seems to try to shove it into my face anytime it can (obviously, it's about WW2).  I guess I'll stick to the fictional shooters from now on :D
405	0	a	bad.  story mode is meh, and the game game will not read the mod folders that have been inserted into the game's files.
406	0	a	Ok this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off, so I installed the game and went in hoping to have some fun with some randoms, it then tells me to create an online profile, so I typed in the name and it went into an infinite loop, so I can't go online and actually play the game for what it is worth, until I get a fix, this is a bad game. Do not buy this game, you might as well pirate it.
407	0	a	I would recommend this game to anyone ... but ONLY if you can get the uncut version i bought it for the zombies but cant play Z-survival  definetly going to refund it ... damn german law system :/
408	0	a	story mode 10/10 zombies play it to much as a kid cant get into it any more 5/10 online dead no one plays it 0/10
409	0	a	Please, i need help guys. how can i play this game with my game controller? It wouldn't play with my gamepad except keyboard and mouse.
410	0	a	As we all know the real reason the Allies won the Pacific Campaign was due to Japanese soldiers inexplicably getting stuck on terrain. This was in despite of their magical powers to walk through mid air, and the fact that occasionally their soldiers simply wouldn't show up, forcing the Allies to load a previous save and try again hoping that the rest of the mission would trigger correctly.   (NSFW)  http://imgur.com/xIPY5gv   Truly, war is hell.
411	0	a	omg, waste of money, online can't connect!!! -.-
412	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
413	0	a	infinite prolie creation loop; cannot play online. Waste of money
414	0	a	Is a good game overall, but its always crashing and forcing me to restart computer along with a bunch of other problems.
415	0	a	call of duty world at war on PC is mostly known for Custom Zombies, its a shame that i cant play it, every map i download, i load up, and then TRY to play, but obviously, it crashes... every single time. but i can run normal zombies, campaign an multiplayer! very annoying
416	0	a	soo its 1000 ppl playing and i cant find a zombie match like what??? gotta question tho is there refunds????
417	0	a	it is riddled with hackers and modders don't buy this unless you have friends to play it with in a private match because it is a struggle finding a match in the first place
418	0	a	This game is just a prank, Online gave me cancer because IT DIDNT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING WORK. Thanks for the feedback.
419	0	a	  this ggame will not load anything dont download this
420	0	a	DONT BUY   severs suck and if u grt into 1 the guy with the shitest wifi will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ur â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ alll day long
421	0	a	The multiplayer does not work anymore you will have to resort to something like tungle in order to use it
422	0	a	Cant find a good lobby or anything. I thought this would bring back memories....... The only thingg good is zombies and campaign.
423	0	a	Awful...glass walls everywhere. Very limited options as far as how to approach any aspect of a mission. Do it wrong, and you'll be doing it over until you do it the way the devs wanted you to do it. You'll be so sick of hearing your sergeant scream at you to win the war all by yourself that you'll be tempted to frag him yourself. Which of course, you can't do.
424	0	a	Poorly done, can't even get into a multiplayer game without a crash.
425	0	a	Personally not a really good game it is quite buggy really good computer reccomended because my computer which is a good gaming one cant load it without crashing and bugged out my steam
426	0	a	You could torrent this game. Only reason i bought it was for multiplayer other than that no servers anymore ):
427	0	a	The game is fine, but if you want a good multiplayer expenrience forget. In multiplayer you die with 1 shoot of every weapon (pistols-2 shot), multiplayer is not balanced, and the knife sistem is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If someone pickup the tank is gg, because the veichles are to much op.  ðŸºBl4ck_WolfðŸº - 5/10 -
428	0	a	Buggy as hell for an old game. Reached a point where everybody was yelling at me to throw satchel chargers and it was literally impossible to do so, nothing I could do to proceed.
429	0	a	wont let me put it in full screen ITS BROKEN YOU SHOULD FIX IT
430	0	a	this one was hard to say no to but no achivements, dead severs, and poorley optiminzetd for not so good computers. rather play console version and hope i dont get into a hacker lobby.
431	0	a	dont buy this game it wont let you connect to anyone if tying to join a lobby or invited to one. also is you close the game it will not let you go back on the game without restarting the computer because 'app is still running' but when going into task manager it is clearly not.

433	0	a	Would be a great game, if only every time i play in multiplayer i get deranked and all my stats reset &gt;:(
434	0	a	This game was good only for zombies until the multiplayer wont let me or my friend join matches so now we cant even play together which was whole reason we got this game. We even tried many ways online on how to fix this cause this is apparently a growing problem.  Fix your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Cod.
435	0	a	Although I love this game I don't recommend buying this game on PC all the multiplayer lobbies are hacked and it honestly isn't worth it.  Now if its on sale only worth $5.99 get it XD
436	0	a	lj game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing useless game keep on not responsible guys pls dont buy this stupid game
437	0	a	Worst game I've ever played. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off Activision
438	0	a	The multiplayer is about dead to be honest. There are several servers that show almost full but they are all down for 'Maintenance' so it redirects you to a server that has like 6 people in it. If you play it for the single player now this is for you, Zombies are about dead too. This game was a classic but its sadly dead. I do not recommend buying it anymore.
439	0	a	u like hacking ? then this game is for u, best hacking community in games history
440	0	a	This game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It wont even open and i cant connect with my friends.
441	0	a	there are too many hackers on multiplayer and the game bugs out. 
442	0	a	its a cool game but theres no multiplayer and no one to play with

448	0	a	I thought this game would be fun, but instead I got a game that I can't invite friends and I can't play online.
449	0	a	For some reason this game now requires more than a quad core and gtx 650 to run because i can't get it to run above 15 fps on any settings
450	0	a	Great game that started the whole Zombie craze! If you buy it, than it better be for the zombies and the zombie mods and maps. However, for the price I would just, well..... not even try. Don't worry you aren't missing too much with this game but if you have the money and don't care about weather you like it or play it or not than its a great game. But don't let the zombies be the only factor on this game.
451	0	a	Looked promising but when actually playing it didnt feel good. Barely played it.
452	0	a	it dissapeard
453	0	a	Multiplayer bug Create online profile loop over and over and over again. Please fix!!!!!
454	0	a	Not recommended if you want to play multiplayer, as a good chunk of multiplayer servers is filled with 60~ bots and most servers has hardcore enabled which can be hit or miss.  You should get this game mainly for zombies/campaign mode instead.
455	0	a	Do not get this game, 50% chance that you will be able to go online. Otherwise, have fun playing solo.
456	0	a	If you're planning on getting this game for the multiplayer or zombies with friends, don't do it.   I bought this game quite some time ago so I can't refund mine, but I bought this for my friend during the steam summer sale so we can play zombies together, we couldn't connect in any way shape or form. We looked online to see if there were ways to fix it, but they all pointed to third party software without any further help. We shouldn't need to download software to play a game released on an online platform like Steam.   Don't buy this game, save your money for another game you know you know can connect without any kind of external assistance
457	0	a	Absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Horse â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Can't Create Online Profiles My â™¥â™¥â™¥. Someone shoot up the activision offices.
458	0	a	Good game, multiplayer is still decent would recommend but it is impossible to find a zombies game unless you have friends you can invite. If you do have friends that play it however you should pick it up
459	0	a	Help, when i opened the game for the first time it said creat profile (so i did) and then it says this no matter what name i type'you need a online profile to play cooperative and multiplayer modes. would you like to create online profile now?' and i click yes then i do the same process and it keeps going. what do i do?  
460	0	a	I have bought the game and I can't even play online becuase of that stupid glitch. It is a waste of money.
461	0	a	this game blows â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, doesnt allow to create a profile. Once u purchase the game, u think u can play it, but NO this game is so bad, and so buggy. u can not even create a damn profile.
462	0	a	No exo jump â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me this is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
463	0	a	it had too many hacked lobbies
464	0	a	you guys need to fix this it wont let me create a online user and i just paid for this game yesterday i demand you fix this because im getting upset that i spent $20 for it
465	0	a	The only reason I do not recommend this game is because of the lack of support and creation of online profiles, and only half of the people that bought this game can play online. Otherwise, great game, but not that fun without online multiplayer and co-op.
466	0	a	It's an alright game to play with friends but if none of your friends have the game and you try to go on a multiplayer match you'll find that almost every servers is an xp server which really takes the fun out of the game zombies almost makes up for this because it too is enjoyable if you have 2-4 friends willing to play if you don't good luck finding a zombies server to join.
467	0	a	The game is nice and fun, but there is one problem I keep having. I can't create an online profile. Everytime I try and put in my name it gives me a notice saying that you need an online profile to play CO-OP and multiplayer. Then I clicked 'ok' and it takes me back to the place where i had to put in my username. It really sucks because I can't play online with my friends. I even refunded the game and re-bought the game to see if it would work, but sadly did not. I just wish this problem could be fixed.
468	0	a	Maybe fix the online profile problem and ill edit this review?
469	0	a	Easy as hell to hack, please fix
470	0	a	This game is just a Scam becouse you are buying it for 20 bugs and almost 80% of the people who bought this game are having the same issue. THE PROFILE BUG/GLITCH and still sometimes it dose work for some people but for me or some friends of mine it dosen't and there is no propper explanation for that Bug to happen so im going ahead and say thet you schouldnt Pay 20 bugs for a game that isint working corectly, you just should buy something else or just save your monye.   Sry for some spelling im not the best in English hope you can understand that.
471	0	a	Fix your Garbage â™¥â™¥â™¥ black screen of death. Only reason i thumbs down this once amazing game is because of the 2016 community on this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do not buy the new Call Of Duty Infinite Warfare ITS CLAERLY A SCAM TO THIN YOUR WALLETS. THEY ARE USING STRAIGHT MIND CONTROL ON OUR SORRY ASSES. BUY BATTLEFIELD 1 PLEASE THEY DESERVE THE SUPPORT OVER THIS CRAP.
472	0	a	I would recomend this game years ago. Now the servers suck, you wont find a server without 3 or 5 hackers. Don't buy it. Spend your money in somethig that worth it.
473	0	a	Every time I go into multiplayer it deletes my progress and i get demoted all the way back to private
474	0	a	Thanks for giving me the censored version Steam! Paid 10 euros for basically nothing, since the single player campaign sucks 4ss. Bought the game for zombies, but got no zombies... Apparently the EU version doesn't have those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ nazi zombies. Cheers!
475	0	a	Played a couple of games and after attempting to open to play again, it would not launch. Self-help recommendations are useless. Just list about 40 programs that could interfere but no explanation as to which one or how to fix. To contact support you need a separate account. Absoulutely useless!
476	0	a	It doesnt working in windows 10 anymore
477	0	a	-Clunky controls. -Nautiating headbob.  (no fov slider) -Treyarch multiplayer.... -No standard playlist, only dedicated server browser.  (Most lobbies are bolt sniper only, or kick) -No (zombie) co-op servers !!! -Pricetag 20,- for a 8 yr. old, nearly dead, game.  No, No, No.....

481	0	a	dont buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game if you want to play multiplayer with anybody, activison needs to get their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together and fix stupid multiplayer connection problems so I don't have to do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t port forwarding and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with my game for 2 hours just to try and play a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing LAN zombies match with someone on MY OWN INTERNET but no.  just google can't create cod waw online profile and you'll see why this game is a waste of your money.

492	0	a	it is not working swear to god i spend money for nothing i played it once and now it is not working
493	0	a	Online servers are no longer supported.  Don't buy this unless it's on sale and you want the single player experience for nostalgia.
494	0	a	great game just wish there was a way to patch it. i downloaded and instailled the patches in order and  now its tells me dvd rom not found? considering its a steam game it would have to do with the patches so im stuck in a pickel
495	0	a	An older shooter that still has a cult following. It seems like everyone has their favorite COD game. This just isn't mine.  Theres issues getting this working on some pcs, everyone is high level at this point, thus you're almost required to use a leveling map before playing for real with most the better weapons unlocked at the very high teirs.   I personally would only buy this game if you have freinds that play it. and if you do have freinds to paly with it is a pretty good game, its just old.
496	0	a	No local co-op. Don't buy if that's what you're looking for.
497	0	a	i dislike that i cant use a controller 
498	0	a	piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
499	0	a	this game on pc sucks  
500	0	a	Terrible optimisation and it feels so unoriginal when it comes to ww2.Those japs spamming grenades at you will give you PTSD. Better try CoD2, thats cod.
501	0	a	Wow. Just... wow. Game is fun... when it works. When I tried to change the settings, it bugged out. When you try to navigate out of the page, you get the 'black screen of no return'. restart computer. repeat. GG, COD.
502	0	a	I bought this game expecting to be able to play custom zombies with friends but when I go into the mods to play one its completely empty. I bought this game to play custom zombies only and thats the ONLY thing I cant do. I dont know if its something with my pc or the game.
503	0	a	i cant get to zombies domt knqo why
504	0	a	The matchmaking is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this game can kill itself... Who?
505	0	a	its saysss is running but i am not even payn it hel me 
506	0	a	I like this game on console/ but I'm sick and tired of not being able to join friends on custom zombie maps on the PC. This is literally ridiculous i bought this game on PC just for that I wasted $21.99 for nothing. Thanks a lot Activision, great way to steal money and waste peoples time!
507	0	a	this sucks and wont even launch
508	0	a	Gets old really fast, not many things to do but at least theres no exos or supply drops. 2/10

510	0	a	Over taken by modders, not a good set up to get into games, no lobbys. Its horrible
511	0	a	First time bad review , I don't like doing this   I bought this game twice on Steam and both times they didn't work . Could hear the music of the game but black screen . me and my friend who also is a fellow Steam member has tried evry solution that people have suggested but none have worked :( . I love this game and have played it before on console but i want it for Steam but it won't work on my pc . So if your going to buy this game make sure you read all the fixes incase this happens to you
512	0	a	Do not buy it! for me it is on German and i can not change it. I am from and live in Sweden so i have no idÃ© what to do.
513	0	a	This Game wont work
514	0	a	Have fun trying to connect to their 'online services'. I've been getting stonewalled by Activision support for over a month now.
515	0	a	DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT MULTIPLAYER:  I bought this for multiplayer zombies. To unlock Zombies, I had to recomplete the campaign, which although is fun I have done a thousand times on my XBOX. The multiplayer did not work for me or my friends and I couldn't refund it because of the playtime I had accumilated unlocking the content that did not work. Waste of time, shame on Steam for not making this clear before purchase.  If you want a good shoot'em up campaign through the European and Pacific theatre's of WW2 and vanilla COD 5 zombies solo however, here's the game.
516	0	a	Nope, hmmmm wait ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... NOPE  Zombies? Wait ... ... ... ... ... ... ... in world full of zombies ... ... ... nope ... this is MAYBE last thing what save this game.   Campaign - short, nothing to say AI - hmmmmmm ... ... ... nope, DIE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DIE!!!!  So why a buy this game? Because i hope on happy world, legend CoD 2. But this game is next empty follower ....
517	0	a	this shouldn't be $20. maybe $10.
518	0	a	  this is gamei s super bugey..  campaign too hard.
519	0	a	If you are like me, Nostalgic towards then you like me will probably dislike this game.  Recently I bought COD WAW to revisit my memorise.  But the game is just not fun and its linear,  This bought me loads of joy when I first played but doesn't hold up well today,  However on the plus side the multiplayer still works and is poplular and the community is great.  If you have friends buy it....if not go die alone like me
520	0	a	my friend does not want to get this game, but this game is good
521	0	a	I played the game once and got off. It then got stuckand always said i was playing, even if i wasnt online. It still wont let me on, and it wont even let me uninstal it. After a while, its gotten better, and allowed me to play it. It still made my computer slow for some weeks, and now tells me i have played 200 hours, even though i have not.
522	0	a	i love this game but the only thing that i wanted was to play with my friend to kill zombies and complete campain but everytime i try to invite him in the game it doesn't allow him and for this i don't recommend it ;C
523	0	a	why cant i play zombies???
524	0	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥
525	0	a	The game does not support Donald J. Trump. It is the worst game of all time. Awful. Run by stupid, stupid people. We need to fix it. The game. It will be tremendous once I'm done with it. It will be a beautiful beautiful thing. Make world at war great again.
526	0	a	I hate this game i cant play with another computer in my house i have two different accounts and i have switched the ports yet it cant join ive done everything i could it just cant join screw this game
527	0	a	its dead Jim. noone realy plays any more.
528	0	a	uhhh No zombies and almost no multiplayer servers to play on, wtf
529	0	a	I live in Germany and I only wanted this game for the zombie mode... because I live in Germany I have no zombie mode but still have to pay the full price thats just unfair
530	0	a	The multiplayer is all modded and when you try to play a good server, hackers over take it
531	0	a	bought the game because of zombies . Can't download any zombie maps gg , and can't refund , fml.
532	0	a	I'm reviewing solely the campaign portion of World at War, since that's what I got the game for and all that I've played.  Years after enjoying World War II shooters like Medal of Honor: Frontline and Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, I wanted something of the same mold. After asking people and reading reviews, I believed that World at War would have the best campaign yet.  I would be disappointed.   From beginning to end, World at War lacks intensity, persuasiveness, and engagement. The game places you onto tracks upon which you complete missions by going through a series of checkpoints. The campaign rushes through the war to put most of its focus on the last months before the Third Reich surrendered, so the momentumâ€™s on your side from the start and nothing you and your squad do actually matters. You play a Russian and American soldier alternatively, who both get undue amounts of recognition by their squad leaders while remaining privates throughout their careers. Insufficient effort is made to make either character feel like your own; instead, youâ€™re seeing their experiences in first person. Treyarch apparently intended to portray common soldiers as unrecognized heroes, and the game developer did an admirable job at that. But besides engendering respect, nearly every other aspect of the game falls short of what even predecessors had.  Whereas in Frontline, many of your missions were done alone and getting to work with teammates was a treat, here, you are always fighting with comrades. There is no infiltrating a village or mansion alone, or completing a mission by modulating your pace and playing style. Instead, you go down hallways and courtyards with your squad, occasionally getting to choose whether to take the right, left, or center path to kill the enemies your allies may take out anyway if you let them. Unlike Big Red One, formerly intimidating trenches are just places to rush in and out as you proceed to your next objective, which will be no more interesting to complete than the last one.  During each mission, I hoped that the game would finally become fun, but by the time around ten hours had elapsed, the campaign was complete with few instances worth remembering, and those few were times when Iâ€™d all but ignored my squad to assault the enemies alone for brief action-packed moments before getting killed.  One the whole, the World at War formulaâ€™s something like this: Wait to get ambushed. Pick up that weapon. Kill those guys (if you can, before your too-ballsy-to-live squadmates rush out and get themselves killed, not that it matters). Move to the next point. Rinse and repeat. If World at Warâ€™s placed in a nutshell, it wonâ€™t want for room.

550	0	a	Absolutely no vanilla multiplayer! - Refund!
551	0	a	As has always been the case with CoD, its multiplayer side is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and rife with cheating, screaming kids and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s on the mic. So for the sake of this review I will focus entirely on the singleplayer aspect of the game. Keep in mind I am writing this from the perspective as someone who enjoys learning about history, and is a big fan of the previous two WW2 CoD games for PC (Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2).  Let's list the pros first.   Much better graphics and more detailed environments than CoD1 and CoD2.    In this one you finally get to fight in the Pacific as the US against the Japanese Empire, which is a new and fresh change from the previous two CoDs which focused entirely on the Allies VS the Nazis.    You are finally able to throw back live grenades to save yourself from death, but this really should've been a default feature of CoD2 anyway. At least they got it right this time.    A decent variety of different mission types and environments. It has much more to offer in terms of gameplay variety than CoD2 did, but still less variety than CoD1 offered.    New types of explosives and special grenades that can be used. Molotovs. Satchel Charges, and throwable Mortar bombs, for example.    Flamethrower weapons that actually burn the environment around you, and can destroy foliage and burn corpses.    Slightly more interactive environments than the previous CoD games.  Sadly those are the only positive things I can say about this game. There are unfortunately a lot more negatives.    Campaign is only 15 or so missions in length, and each mission is also very short in length, taking only 10 minutes or so to complete. On the previous two WW2 CoDs for PC, they both had AT LEAST 23 missions, each of which was decently long and had more historical atmosphere.    Fences, EVERYWHERE. Where the heck are all these warring people getting all these barb-wire and pikestick fences from, how do they have the time to place them all, and why are these fences specifically confining people into very well-defined and convenient areas for the player? CoD2 fixed this problem a lot on the majority of their maps by using minefields instead to kill the player if they tried to leave the map, but unfortunately this game has practically NO use of that mechanic and instead just has tons of fences spammed everywhere.    Game-breaking bugs that make some missions impossible to complete without totally restarting. For example, on the Eviction level, there's a 50% chance that your team leader (the old russian guy, I don't remember what his name was) will get stuck in the motioning-in animation by the grate-door opening to the subway, and you need him with you to complete the mission. All you can do to fix this is to restart the mission and HOPE he doesn't do it again.    Much of the game's atmosphere is just zombie-apocalyptic with death metal music for ambience, probably done by the developers to appeal to your average run-of-the-mill FPS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s who don't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about history and just want to shoot stuff.    The mounting feature for deployable weapons (such as the MG42) is practically useless because there are almost no points on any of the maps where you can actually mount it at. You should be able to mount it anywhere you are at, there's no reason not to be able to.    The Russians are depicted as murderous, merciless, brutal monsters, who kill everything in sight, terrorize and torture innocent people, and take no prisoners. In some ways with Communist USSR, this is accurate, but the developers pushed this attitude onto the Russian characters in the game to the point where it's arguably anti-russian propaganda.    Many of the Pacific Campaign maps are poorly designed, with it being impossible to see where you are going without literally walking alongside the map's [s]fluid and convenient fences[/s] walls just to find the path.    The GUI is cartoonish and poorly designed. Instead of a large number counter to show the bullets in your clip, you have a tiny little indicator in the bottom righthand corner of your screen, with the bullets in your clip shown by actual individual icons of bullets, which are so small you can barely even see them. This is something that the previous two WW2 CoDs were much better at in regard.    The main characters in the game are completely flat, boring and static; they have very little about them that's interesting and are just your average generic soldiers with guns. Even in the previous CoDs they managed to make their characters interesting and much more engaging.    Unlike the previous WW2 CoDs which each had about 2 tank levels, this one only has one tank battle level, and it sucks. The tank movement mechanics are unresponsive and poorly designed, and it's extremely easy to get your tank stuck, to where you have no choice but to restart the level. CoD1 did a great job of providing stable tank movement, with the ability to just hold the spacebar to have your tank orientate with the turret. Oh yeah, that reminds me: You can't drive independently with free turret movement. The tank only drives in the direction your turret faces.    The beautiful sound effects for guns that were in CoD2 have all been thrown out in favor of generic, much-quieter bullet sounds. Very disappointing from an aesthetic standpoint.    The melee knifing mechanic is extremely overpowered and oftentimes I have just resorted to flanking my enemies and knifing them all. It's incredibly unrealistic and historically inaccurate, and is one of the most unbalanced and tasteless video game mechanics ever invented.    The sprinting mechanic is likewise overpowered and lets you run super-fast for long distances, with a very short and very invisible recharge time.   All in all this game was clearly just made to appeal to mindless 'MLG 360 Noscope' FPS gamers, with little regard for appropriate treatment of historical atmosphere or character development. I must say I am considerably disappointed in this game, and I can't really recommend it to anyone with an IQ above 90.

553	0	a	I got this game for the co-op. I don't really care for the story, but this is why I am very displeased with this waste of ca$21.99. The nazi zombie coop is completely terrible for joining your friends, it simply does not work without a 3rd party program helping this game.
554	0	a	This game sucks for reason that you cannot run at all i got Banned from all of the servers for running to cover WWII Had running , thowing grenades while moving and aiming down the sites All of these things will get you banned from servers
555	0	a	this game is fooking terrible m8
556	0	a	10/10 Would have none working servers agaiN
557	0	a	I dont enjoy this game. 
558	0	a	Multiplayer dosen't work, Why would it say theres multiplayer when there isn't???
559	0	a	If you are considering downloading this game for the sole purpose of playing Nazi Zombies online, do not get this game. The process it takes for you to not only unlock the zombie game mode but to actually find a game and connect is not worth it. Not to mention 90% of lobbies are moded maps which you need to download beforehand.
560	0	a	Can't connect to online play It takes forever to download and the campaign is very similar to others and other cods are just better
561	0	a	It crashes at the end of the 2nd level everytime for me.
562	0	a	it great game
563	0	a	welcome to cod a game populated by lonely 40 year old men hoping to fufill their dreams of joining an army (you could join a militia at the age of 5 in my home land) the lonely 40 year olds playing this game can be very volatile because one time I was doing a joint co-op mission with these gay lords and suddenly they started screaming at me '2 IS DOWN' I was very confused because I have absolutely no clue who 2 is and why he is down so I decided that was enough and so I started screaming at them 'IS THERE A XBOX VERSION OF THIS?' whilst typing that I was guzzling a 4l bottle of mtn dew and also crunching on a 50kg bag of chilli heatwave doritos and came to the swift conclusion i'm not better than the people i'm offending.  So I decided to join the local army only to have my leg blown off by an IED and then die.  5/10 - halo is way better with grafixs and simulotion also THERE IS TOO MANY VEHICLES IN THIS GAME!!!!!!!!
564	0	a	Horrible game, Multiplayer is impossible with friends as everything gos wrong when creating a lobb or loading into a game. I highly do NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone.
565	0	a	cus I feel like it.
566	0	a	I got the german Version and its Boring.  No Zombie mode and I only buyed it because the Zombie mode -.- 
567	0	a	if you thought you would be able to play nazi zombies online; youd be wrong, this is a waste of money and a peice of garbage.

574	0	a	THIS GAME IS A PEICE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND SHOULD NOT BE FOR SALE!!!!!! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BLACK SCREEN OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ CUNT WHY THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!
575	0	a	This game is a steaming sack of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I got this game as a gift from a friend and I was excited to relive Nazi Zombies, this time, on PC. But the problem is that Activision doesnt know how to make a game becuase all I get is 'connect to online services'. I have no idea why, but it seems I'm not the only one with the problem. Seriously google 'why can't i connect to games on world at war for steam' and a load of people have this problem. Worst of all some of these are 2 years old, meaning those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bags of â™¥â™¥â™¥ havent done jack â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with it. Its truly a gamble with this game. Either you have it working or no. You are better off sticking to the console for this game.
576	0	a	how do you do the zombie mods?????????? or else a refund
577	0	a	Complete and utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  1/5 Stars
578	0	a	CALL OF DUTY HACKERS AT WAR!!!!   you are playing a fair game on a good server then suddenly 6 hackers jump in to that server and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your game and killstreaks then admins come online and says oh hello hackers how you doing then you say admin please kick the hackers and he says excuse me what hackers you mean the guy who is using wallhack or aimbot which one and you are like -.- then if u use a single F word u will be banned from the server   BEST GAME EVER BEST ANTI - CHEAT SYSTEM THANK YOU STEAM!

579	0	a	It's a good game but if you have have an old computer it will lag my pc is new hp laptop
580	0	a	This game is way to laggy 
581	0	a	I can see the appeal, but the PC port is too janky for my taste.
582	0	a	Servers are very limited, and the only ones I can find are 'Tactical' servers. Will someone tell me what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is so god damn tactical about only crouch walking every where. If you stand up you get yelled at and then kicked from the game. I hate is so much. These kids are stupid as hell. Sorry, but if you wanna relive the good days of CoD WaW, you are gonna have to try your luck on Xbox or PlayStation.
583	0	a	As soon as I got the game i had an error that a lot of other people got during the start of the game where they cant play multiplayer, and there is no solution
584	0	a	I dont know if its me or the game but i cant go online  A few days i got a $20 steam card and redeem it and bought WaW right after. So i waited then i got to play it and i made my profile for online. Then i played multiplayer then when i wanted to play csgo i left the application and saw my cousin playing WaW so i jumped back on then i cant join online and i was getting faustrated and mad so i did research and i still couldnt go online. I just wanted to play with my cousins and friends but i cant.   I just wasted 20 dollars that a game i cant have fun with
585	0	a	First of all im in germany and why can't i play zombies? please help
586	0	a	After playing 12 hours (and even days of playing on console and other accounts) of Call of Duty V: World at War, I can say this game is dead. Well the multiplayer version is due to the lack of good quality servers; most of the servers now are level boosting, bazooka and rifle grenade chaos. Despite the care for hackers, they have ruined it for the consoles but on here its somewhat tolerated. The only thing now is the zombies; the mini game that brought Treyarch its name today. This game mod origanally has 4 WaW maps and now has a plethora of Custom Zombies maps. The only real purpose of this game now the zombies. Unfortunatly, I do not recommend this game now. Rating: 6/10 okay.
587	0	a	Doesnt work on windows 10. Although I have tried different compability options, it wont work.
588	0	a	Single player wise, I thought COD 4 (Modern Warfare) was good and refreshing. But this... this is back to enemies (and comrades) showing up in endless streams and it's badly masked. There are attempts to tell some kind of story and make the player bond to characters, but they fail. Might be related to the situation always being 'OMG WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND KILL THE BAD GUYS'. While action is nice, a change in pace could have helped the 'story'.  The entire thing feels soulless and predictable from start to end. This has been done before.  Can't speak for multiplayer.
589	0	a	YOU'LL NEVER FIND A MULTIPLAYER GAME.....SO SAVE YOUR TWENTY BUCKS AND SPEND IT ELSEWHERE.
590	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing multiplayer dont work
591	0	a	Get it if you want, but there really isn't any reason to. Call of Duty games aren't bad games, but there are so many other better games that there is no point of getting them. Like the Nazi Zombies? Get Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 (this is actually a lot more fun than I thought it would be). Like the singleplayer? Get Wolfenstein 3D, they have about the same depth, or Metro if you're looking for a game with good combat and great singleplayer, or Red Orchestra 2 if you're looking for a WW2 style single player (but it's really not that good). Like the multiplayer? Get Verdun, Red Orchestra, or Rising Storm. They all do it better, and even if they are a little different, trust me, you'll have more fun with them.
592	0	a	If there was mulitplayer, it is no longer there.
593	0	a	Why does steam charge 25 dollars for a game thats 10 years old and only has 300 people playing it.. un beliveable
594	0	a	DO NOT BUY. I love this game but they shut down ALL of the servers so you can't play online zombies or multiplayer; I.E. TDM CTF SAD. all you can do is campagin and solo zombies
595	0	a	cmopter cannot run multiplayer in the game game is fun but multiplayer crashes my computer
596	0	a	I thought there would be zombies solo but you can not do that unlike xbox 360 i bought this game for solo zombies and its not on here only 2 or more players.
597	0	a	hated this game DO NOT GET IT already waiting for my refund!
598	0	a	Does not let me play coop with friends
599	0	a	Didnt Really like it to be honest i acctuly thought i would enjoy it but i really didnt for starters its glitchy and The Multiplayer setup is horrible i only really bought it to play Zombies cause i remember playing zombies with my cousin on console but i was really disapointed by evrey thing
600	0	a	is good game i learnt to to make toast
601	0	a	is good game i learnt to to make toast
602	0	a	OK just got this game on steam sale and was excited about playing it, well short into it i found its just loaded with hackers with aim bots so excitement died right there. but if you are buying it for the campagne, go ahead but if you want to play multiplayer do not. every match you play will be with someone hacking. honestly i have no idea how these hackers have fun putting 800 hrs into a game they just cheat in, all they do is press one button and thats the left mouse clicker.
603	0	a	one thing that i didnt like is the fact that i had to complete the story mode to get zombies when you can just get started into multiplayer, its a stupid system.
604	0	a	You REALLY need to be a fan of CoD's mechanical horse hockey if you're gonna lay 20 bucks down on this.  Respawning enemies that kill you in 2 hits.  Turtle's pace movement speed and the sticky, doesnt-stop-when-you-need-it sprinting.  The guns are nice and historically boring, even if a little too close to the screen.   Controller support is lousy, surprising for a console port. If it had straight up no-hassle 360 controller support I would'nt be complaining, and I'd still have this installed. You can force it to read your input via a console command but there's no vibration, rendering it pointless, if you ask me.  The russian campaign and zombie mode are the best this thing has to offer.  For everything else? You need a high tolerance for bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and your own time going in a hole.  The multiplayer CAN be fun. wasn't for me. you might even enjoy the pacific theatre levels of the campaign.  If you like call of duty, and you liked finest hour and all the other old ones, you'd love this. Treyarch is still better than infinity ward.  OH. no achievements. This doesn't matter in the big scheme of things but this is a console port. Ya think they'd have put the effort of patching some cheevsters in here for the steam version.
605	0	a	Sound quality is very low and the game is very buggy. Only a few minutes in and I saw a bunch of T-poses along with a nice crash.
606	0	a	did not work playing with friends 
607	0	a	Good game when playing alone. but the real frustration is trying to play co-op. IT DOES NOT WORK!!! GET ON THIS GUYS COME ON!!!!!
608	0	a	why cant u just play zombies
609	0	a	- Horrible console FOV that feels terrible playing on a monitor three feet away rather than a big TV ten feet away. For the peanut gallery: FOV has nothing to do with the quality of your screen, it's about how much you can see, and has a big effect on whether you get motion sickness playing a game. Most modern 1st person games have adjustable FOV sliders in the options. This doesn't, and the FOV is way too narrow.  - Stupid 'portraits' of a developer in Nazi uniiform hanging up in buildings. This isn't an Easter Egg. It might be if there was *one* in a difficult-to-find room: these are all over bombed-out Berlin, where in the Third Reich pretty much every building would have had a picture of Adolf Hitler. It doesn't feel like a cheeky hidden secret, it feels like smirking, masturbatory game developer BS. It also doesn't help that the person in question is a pudgy neckbeard who doesn't in the slightest resemble the average Nazi officer ubermensch type. Maybe Reinhard Heydrich had a shelf full of panty-flashing anime statuettes above his desk, but he sure didn't look that way: this guy does, and it's a huge immersion breaker.  - Keeps calling Soviets 'Russians'. No, this isn't 'racism', it's historical inaccuracy. The Red Army was composed of troops from all over the USSR, not just Russia. It's like calling anyone from the USA a Texan.  Feels like it was developed by people who've seen lots of movies and never read a book (I guess that's the target audience too - a death spiral of ignorance). I'd like to say 'but hey, it's Call of Duty, whaddya expect', but I can't, because the first CoD game was superb. However, this one comes from the same clowns who gave us the Black Ops series, so it's a lot of Michael Bay-style orange fireball theatre, cliches and general d1ck-wagging.  The briefings are nicely done, though.
610	0	a	i cant play zombies with my friends
611	0	a	Steam, Fix your game It always says it running when i Close the game and then im unable to invite people to my games. FIX YOUR GAME
612	0	a	Fun to play but crashes to much to be enjoyable.
613	0	a	Buggy and frankly the missions suck. Stupid AI is constantly putting friendly npcs in front of you for you to shoot.  At one point I lost my weapon due to an attack from a dog. The notice that the dog attack remained on the screen and I could no longer pick up any weapon. Aborting the mission meant going back to the very beginning instead of that particular phase.  I recall playing COD (the very first one) a long long time ago and it was with a fond remembrance that I bought this game. Unfortunately the player in solo mode is too tied to his AI squad mates who are stupider than dirt. The graphics might be better than the very first COD, but not by much.   I'm sure that this is great in coop or multiplayer, but I don't play those modes and they have no appeal for me. If I want to play with someone I'll do it face to face thanks muchly.   This was just not a good purchase as far as I'm concerned. I can't recommend it.
614	0	a	Piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... totally worst COD of all time.. not sure if worst game of all the time.. totall waste of time.. dont buy.. dont play
615	0	a	This game is the epitome of bad ports. Non stop problems, just wanted to play some zombies with my friends but there's nothing but connectivity issues and crashes. It's sad that activision still keeps this game priced at $20 and never below $10 on sale. This game should be selling for $3 and no more because it's pathetic to sell a game this unstable for $20
616	0	a	this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game sucks donkey â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dont buy unless you suck donkey â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!!!!
617	0	a	This is one of the only Call of Duty's I would ever say go out and buy... Until Punkbuster dropped support for all the old Call of Duty's if it wasn't for the horrible Punkbuster anti-cheat I would recommend it. If you want to play it for the custom zombies with friends, yes go out and buy this game. But for Multiplayer you're better off picking up the newest one thats out because any server that has Punkbuster enabled all it's going to do is cause you a headache from frustration.
618	0	a	one of the worst games i have ever played ( just kidding )
619	0	a	it keeps on freezing on me and it lags too much and its not worth getting it
620	0	a	Pretty much what you might expect from a Call of Duty game, for better or worse. The graphics are pretty good, and there are some admittedly great set piece moments, but like every CoD game after the original game and its expansion, the majority of the campaign is pretty tedious and far too predicatable, and the story is really lazy and dumb, despite decent attempts to break the mold by good voice over by Gary Oldman and Kiefer Sutherland, and having the game take place in the Pacific and Eastern Europe, rather than Normandy and the Ardennes as is the case with most WWII shooters.  The multiplayer is definitely entertaining for a while, and I appreciate the campaign co-op option, but honestly the only reason I come back to this game at all is the mindless, yet hilariously fun Nazi Zombie mode; this alone was almost worth the price I paid, and would be the only reason I would consider picking up another CoD game in the future.
621	0	a	This game is bad, Zain made me buy it and I've fed up of Zomboids. God damn enslaving raptors make me feel like dragging my eyes through a meat grinder.
622	0	a	the game didnt let me open it
623	0	a	it won't let me play the game..!! 
624	0	a	ok its a good game for its campaine but it needs a workshop there is not that much content
625	0	a	bugs bugs and more bugs  error 51 first now crashes when i'm trying to change gparhics settings  tired of bugs in games
626	0	a	The Call of Duty franchise was great until this game came out, where do i begin...  Pros:  Historical accuracy and information is much more than the previous games.  You get to play as an American captive in the Pacific Theatre, which was never done in the previous two games  You can throw a activated grenade back at the enemy if you are quick enough.  On that note, you get far less ammo than the previous two games, making the game more realistic  You can reload the M1 Grand without having to deplete the entire clip.  Cons:  The voice acting is disgusting. It sounds like it was tacked on as an afterthought rather than integrated into the actual game. It sounds like Treyarch hired the actors from b-reel movies.  The cinematics don't show a lot of game play, They are also too 'active' and they do not give us enough time to let us understand what we are supposed to learn from the Pacific Theatre, for example.  The FOV is horrendous, and while there is mod support, a game this advanced should have come standard with an FOV Slider.  The sound quality in general is not of the same fidelity as it was in the previous two games. Granted the engine is more 'advanced,' I liked the clip ejection 'ping' from the M1 Grand from the previous two games.  Conclusion:  I am thankful I got this was a part of the CoD War Chest bundle over Christmas 2015 rather than full price. This game is not worth your money since it takes so many steps back and tries to become an interactive movie instead. Very disappointed by the quality of this game overall. At least it looks pretty.
627	0	a	One of the best in the series, with it's gore physics and interesting campaign as well as OG Nazi Zombies, possibly only being undone by Black Ops' presidential zombie defense mode.  I guess it's fun, but I wouldn't recommend getting it nowadays, as multiplayer's broken; it's basically turned into a snipefest.
628	0	a	I WANT A REFUND!!!
629	0	a	only good for zombies dont play multiplayer
630	0	a	No longer works with Punk Buster, Unable to play online multiplayer at all.  It WAS a good game.
631	0	a	Don't buy if you want to play zombies with your friends. It doesn't work you can find countless people online complaing about this. I tried every thing I could find and nothing works. Regular mulitplayer works fine but zombies doesn't. Can't reccommend a game when half of it doesn't work.
632	0	a	I've been playing this for a few eyars now and still can't decide if I like it, the graphics even by todays are great the story is immersive and the teamwork and AI are also well up to speed.  BUT  Its incredibly frustrating, for me games are supposed to be fun and this just isn't at times. The US campaigns especially are ruined by the sheer amount of bloody grenades and a gameplay is just hours of reading the 'watch the grenade indicator' caption. The lack of a savegame feature means if you don't hit a checkpoint you are doomed to relive the same bit over and over and over and over again to find after the 350th attempt (so it seems) you are just about there and you guessed it - bloody grenade!  TBH I'd give it a miss the frustration factor is just too much I'd rather a game that is actual fun not tedious and frustrating this is by far the worst COD game that I've played
633	0	a	i only bought this for zombies. i hate cod. this one is one of the worst despite what fanboys might say. like all cod games the mp is uninspired, and more of luck/spray and pray based than any kind of skill oriented shooter. the single player is plauged by HUGE issues that should have dissapeared years ago, constantly respawning enemies until you reach a certain point, enemies spawning out of mid air (ive come into rooms only to be confronted by a lmg popping into existance out of nowhere in front of me, and the squad ai serves as only a distraction to the equally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ enemies. your squad seems unable to kill targets 3 feet in front of them and they constantly tell you to move up and complete tasks without any kind of covering fire etc. it breaks immersion and comes across as just plain stupid. hey you go shoot 3 tanks with an rpg while being nade spammed and rushed by enemies while we sit behind cover and let u do all the work! its uninspired and LAZY. its artifical difficulty. games are supposed to be harder based on clever design not constant nades every 2-3 second and useless ai that gets in ur way when you try to run away. ive been killed more times from being blocked by my squad than by making mistakes. its broken and stale. which is really dissapointing considering the interesting setting. i cant see why anyone would like this game when there are much better cleverly crafted shooters on the market that dont use nade spam as a crutch for difficulty. return to castle wolfenstien is a good example of a shooter done right. if u can get it on sale for the zombies mode it can be worth it as mods can make it its own game alone, however the base game (what the game is meant to be) is a 5/10 at best. poor design does not =good difficulty . ive been playing shooters my entire life and am a smfc in counterstrike. skill is not an issue. give this one a pass unless you like zombie mode, there are much better options, that are much more worth the money.

I dont know about you but playing the game in a lobby and spending 16 hours looking at videos on youtube on how to get multiplayer working are two seperate things.  Dont waste your money it seems like a good idear at the time, but dont do it.

654	0	a	I downloaded it and then i open it and it doesnt â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing work
655	0	a	I could not play this game because of something with the graphics driver.And I can't get my money back.
656	0	a	You pay $20 for a game thats 8 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing years old and it runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, not only is the game broken as hell but you cannot even connect with your friends and play zombies. Also the online multiplayer is absolute horse â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I would never recommend buying this peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I have no idea why a 8 year old game is still $20 I guess these jews did not get enough money out of the franchise yet, I mean the logic is amazing black ops 2 and 3 are the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing price, like are you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kidding me, wtf is wrong with their brains. Last but not least DO NOT give these piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ jew bags any more money they dont deserve a single â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing penny.
657	0	a	Played it for a while with friends, now want to play with my brother (same ip) Unable, would've recommended it but this is a big let down...... Please fix this
658	0	a	It is ok. 5/10
659	0	a	I cant get on zombies or get mods why is this 
660	0	a	DO NOT buy this game, no more classic zombies,no more multiplayer servers that you will like. its sad to see how this game is now.

663	0	a	my multyplayer is can't be played
664	0	a	for some unknown reason i can't play this game you name it i've tried it. im royally upset
665	0	a	Bought it for modding. Worked very well for weeks. Very great. Until...... I tried hosting a game like usual. 'Can't Connect to our Online Address' This was odd so I tried to uninstall and reinstall it. No help. Verify Cache. Nope. Googled it. People had the same problems with little to no fix. Activision get your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together. And btw. This applies to Call of Duty Black Ops as well. So I am thinking all CoD games have this problems. Don't waste your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time. Activision won't help you.
666	0	a	For the premium price still demanded by Activision there should be more support by the developer. Controller support for one. The servers are a mess, punk buster is dated and there is no OFFICIAL support for the bugs it presents. It's a barebones port and its enjoyable, but it should sell for less than a physical copy on the xbox 360, with so much less to offer.
667	0	a	After playing countless hours on Black Ops II, I wanted to relax and play some old school WaW zombies. Came with every zombie map in WaW. Zombies was really fun. I got to use the old World War II weapons on zombies, and people weren't lying when they said that World At War is probably the bloodiest and goriest CoD out on the market today. If only the Multiplayer servers weren't hacked and modded, I could have some actual fun playing multiplayer using WWII weaponry. There is literally ZERO vanilla servers, and it literally feels like I'm looking for a server in Garry's Mod.  I'll give this game a 6/10 due to multiplayer being terrible, but zombies are about the only thing you want to get this game for, unless you want to play on a modded/hacked server. Definitely not worth $19.99, or even $14.99, but probably like $9.99, which is when it is 50% off.
668	0	a	i cant even shutdown the game after im done
669	0	a	I cant join my friend on co-op. Someone please message me on a fix to this
670	0	a	I used to play this all day on xbox 360, few weeks ago i bought it and i thought i will have fun again but no. This pc port is bad. You can even change game resolution without freezing. I don't recommend this game.

676	0	a	Hello, if you are going to buy this game again after migrating from Xbox, please take a few notes. If you happened to play World at War during the next annualized release, at which point they stopped updating/patching the game and went on with the next, you'd know that even on consoles this game was riddled with hackers of all kind. Wallhackers, aimbotters, rainbow names and such. The game has not changed on PC, and they are doing nothing to stop this, so unless you have absolutely no soul I would completely avoid Multiplayer. Keep in mind the game is not entirely pointless to buy. Most get it simply just for zombies, and while there is no mod support it seems Treyarch is fine with custom maps and zombies-type gamemodes, but the downside is that there will be absolutely no vanilla servers if not playing with friends. This is kind of where it gets excrutiating after purchasing the game, as playing Vanilla was the first thing I wanted to do. Der Reise servers seem to be your best bet if looking to play vanilla, as it's such a good map that those who mod Zombies servers seem to not mess with it. Playing with friends seems to be one of the only ways to truly have fun, so if you lack the friends, either visit discussions and add someone or make friends with people on Zombies servers. As said before, do not even try to play multiplayer in it's dead state. There are little to no actual, true players in it anymore and I doubt there ever will be again. Even servers with no hacks on seem to have Double XP on, which completely ruins the build-up and fun of multiplayer in the first place.  Campaign: 8/10. Multiplayer: Dead, kicked into a ditch, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on and lit on fire. Many negative numbers/10 Zombies: 9/10, godmodders and such are present, otherwise vanilla it is one of the best games ever made.
677	0	a	Possibly the last COD game set in world war 2, world at war is still just another generaic FPS like most COD. In fact this game has repeated scene from the first and second call of duty, and Medals of honor; Pacific Assault. But overall it's still a good game, especially the multiplayer and the first with nazi zombies. If your a fan of the COD, especially the original games, then this is a must have, and has some of the best controls of the series.  Also note mention is that it is a prequel to the first black ops COD game.
678	0	a	where is the zombies i can play multiplayer and story it says right here that i have to buy the gane and then pay more  money for zombies and that is not cool i should at least have one map but no i have to pay to play a game that i bought and only get multiplayer and campain i would recommend this game to any one who wants to get scammed and yes i have tried you tube before and it only tells you how to download the custom modded maps
679	0	a	well this game dose not work for me ive played it on my xbox 360 loved the zombies but the game wont luanch other then that it should be fine.
680	0	a	game crashes when I open it so I got a refund and I'll only buy it again if they fix this issue.
681	0	a	multiplayer runs extremely fine without lag, campaign on the other hand lags and has framedrop constantly, please this game came out in 2008, mw3 came out in 2011 and my computer runs that just fine, i play demanding games like warthunder and battlefield 4 and they run just fine but cod waw's campaign lags and the frames drop constantly? pretty much a waste of money.
682	0	a	I hate how I can't get on multiplayer servers... I would appreciate if someone would explain why 
683	0	a	Worst game I ever played game keep's crashing when i load it up.
684	0	a	why isnt this game wooorking it always goes to to a black screen 
685	0	a	I bought the game to play Co-Op with my son over LAN. It does not work over LAN. I just spent 3 hours ready many reports by people saying the exact same thing on every forum I went to. It seems to be a problem with the IP or something. I give up. Why should I pay for a game and spend more time roleplaying tech support than actually doing what I payed for? I shouldn't and neither should you. Don't buy it if you even remotely enjoy playing games over LAN. It's painful.
686	0	a	Not enough memes are you kidding me? Doesn't even have rust OR any interventions in game 0/10
687	0	a	Sadly i bought this, the servers are down i can't find one the ones i do lack luster and aren't filled with people. but you're a zombie fan (me) you'll enjoy it 6/10 would recomend in its current state.

691	0	a	]i want my refund now it doesnt even let me play th game.
692	0	a	I played this game after I played COD2 and I have to say COD2 is better eventhough it came before. First, no tutorial chapter to tell you the control. Second weapons' sound are a bit weird after playing COD2 and COD. The cutscene sometimes (especially the seelow height level) are confusing. If this game doesn't have COD stuck on it, I definitely won't buy.
693	0	a	i recommend this game 2 people who want 2 die and hang themselves twice with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥....but seriously custom maps have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ everywhere and i need more mods.
694	0	a	Hoped for more but, didn't deliver have had better CoD experiances, not worth the money unless it's free.
695	0	a	Don't get for pc it sucks do not buy get for xbox or ps3
696	0	a	I CANT EVEN START THE F*CKING GAME
697	0	a	Bought this game with some friends to play zombies and it didnt work. No matter what we tried or looked up online we couldnt connect to each other. So i would say not to buy this game if your sole purpose is for the zombies portion of it.
698	0	a	this game is very good apart from the fact it isnt mac compatible
699	0	a	I cant play this game coop because of the trying to join potential matches please help me!

712	0	a	I can not get into the zombies ( co-op ). Tried the said fixes. Nothing. Can any one help.
713	0	a	Crashes at lauch, waste of money
714	0	a	The singleplayer campaign for this game is literally just a spam of grenades.  On the hardest difficulty setting, you can have as many as THREE active grenade-warning-indicators at your location at a single time + infinite enemy respawn. No other call of duty that I've played has had so many grenades being chucked at you. The only way to complete levels on this difficulty is to just rush through.  The sniper boss fight segment is almost impossible to do on the hardest difficulty as well and makes no logistical sense (the enemy sniper does not obey the laws of physics or any constraints of the human body in how fast he can get from window to window to ruin your day)
715	0	a	My Multiplayer wont work and i cant get a hold of Activision's PIECE OF CRAP CUSTOMER SERVIC ON TWITTER!!!! WTF

718	0	a	it WAS good on consoles back in the day, it IS terrible here on this platform. Multiplayer is a wasteland of custom servers and high ping regular ones.
719	0	a	DO NOT BUY FOR PC ITS BROKEN AND THERE IS NO DEV SUPPORT. There is virtually no multiplayer community either just high ping modded servers with bots. All you can do in this is Single Player Zombies. If you want any form of Multiplayer go buy it for the Xbox or PS3.
720	0	a	After what I have learned about this game and all the other cod games...I've had my fair issues with games like this, but now that I know that people are killing themselves over it...Well that is just plain wrong.  Don't think its true? Google it smart ones....
721	0	a	I like the game, singleplay is ok, multiplayer...I get kicked from everygame with punkbuster after 20 seconds of being in game, I have tried reinstalling in several times and updating punkuster, nothing works, can't play multiplayer.

727	0	a	This game is great on console, but if you don't have an amazing computer, it's a waste of money. There goes 20$ of mine down the drain becuase the framerate is so bad it's almost impossible to play (and i have all settings turned down) this game is just common for having awful framerate. (i'd prefer it on console) :(

734	0	a	Call of Duty: World at War is actually an okay Call of Duty game in my opinion. But I still can't love it.  Pros: + Explores the story of different factions during the war + AI are deadly + Gunplay and gameplay were fun + World War II setting + Love the Japanese soldiers. Tenno Heika Banzaiiii  Neutral: = Call of Duty = Generic FPS, altough fun in times = Voice acting is meh  Cons: - Call of Duty - Repetetive gameplay, hardly entertaining - Tiring like war. That should be a pro - Some checkpoints are stupid. Died to a flamerthrower trooper   instantly   (Meant to kill an 'important' person). Had to replay the level 5 more times...

741	0	a	Cant host online zombies matches to play with friends.
742	0	a	If you buy this game for Zombies good your gonna have a good time with that. Multiplayer however is super trash and pointless. The online is full of hackers and high ping servers. You will not be able to have a good experience with it no matter how hard you try. Plus creating servers for just you and your friends is very diffcult and is not worth the struggle.

746	0	a	Warning: this game is MAY NOT compatible with Windows 8 or higher. I bought this game to play WaW and play some custom zombies but I didn't know that it keeps giving me an error that won't fix. If you can find a fix, please let me know and don't buy the game if you have Windows 8 or 8.1. Recently afterwards, i re-ran World at War after a long period of time and it worked. And most of the time when I try to stream or record this, it crashes on me.
747	0	a	Error creating account  Fastest refund ever
748	0	a	Can't change the fov, don't buy.
749	0	a	I disliked every aspect of this game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ servers with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ rules, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ everything. On the off chance you find an Australian server with more than 1 person in it every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ just camps in bushes, where it is impossible to see them because of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful model/game textures/colours/etc/etc. Every person in the game seems to have a fetish for 'crouch servers' where you literally get banned for everything from standing up, sprinting, killing an admin, throwing a nade, using a 'naughty word', I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you not thats how the console described it. If the game was 4 dollars I would still seriously question buying it. Waste of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money. Got kicked/permanently banned from no less than 20 servers in less than an hour for, 'hacking', 'swearing', 'spamming chat' (spam has been redefined to 2 messages apparently), 'sprinting', 'jumping', 'glitching', literally anything you can think of I got banned for it. Single player, as with every cod is a waste of time and the only way to even play zombies is with console commands if you can't be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed doing the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ campaign. Could rant more but why bother. Would r8 2/8 m8.

754	0	a	Buy it if you have friends to play custom zombie maps, donÂ´t buy it if you donÂ´t have friends
755	0	a	'Cannot connect to online service'  I've trawled through the discussion threads and I notice many other people have had the same problem, and it still persists even now. I've tried the few suggestions people have made with no results, meaning no-one actually knows how to fix it.  Shame, I heard co-op zombies with the custom mapss is a lot of fun, but it seems that for some of us the game is just broken beyond repair.

Instead of this problem being fixed I just get told to 'sux, backup next time lol'. Wtf am I supposed to do, redo all that grinding for my crap? Why hasn't this been fixed since 2008?
762	0	a	This game is really bad, the only good thing is Nazi Zombies, and even still, when it lags and you try and change your settings so you can actually play it makes your screen freeze forever, and when you try and access your task manager it doesn't let you beceause World at war freezes your home page as well denying you from clicking anything.

Fu#k you treyarch for not helping fix this.
771	0	a	After Treyarch spent most of their budget hiring mainstream Hollywood actors Kiefer Sutherland (better known as Big Boss in Metal Gear Solid 3, Metal Gear Solid 4, and Metal Gear Solid 5) and Gary Oldman (Die Hard), they were forced to reuse their art and sound assets, which meant a greater focus on the Eastern Front campaign. The Pacific campaign suffered as a result, being reduced to a paultry side story, leaving out the historic invasion of mainland Japan and the takeover of the Imperial Diet by elements of the US Marines. Not recommended for those of German or Japanese descent.

Like WTF is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ they both have Autsim they probably played CSGO out of 16 rounds and Russian â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed USA so you switch teams and elimnate someshit, they hackers come on the server and you have to take MOTHERRUSSIAN back with this game named Mason , Woods , Reznov? 50 cent? I guess but sure dive into a lot of Tank Action this game is more like Explosive Simulator, and the PreSequel that Started it all : World of Tanks. Where you can Rent-A-Tank and get kills and win and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and I don'k â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing know liek Spoderman is a Exicting game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ign Spoderman, Spoderman, Spoderman. This game is all about â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es, hors, gays, bisexuals, homophobics, why don't you become Bruce Jenner and get your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Cut off so they can drill a hole to get a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ign â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Zombies don't even eat your brain they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hit you like if they have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing SHarp â™¥â™¥â™¥ Nails then you Drink â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing SuperDrinks, and you already know they put â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing COCAINE IN THAT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to get like Superman and survive as many Rounds, then they add DOGS so they can bite your â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and then â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing die and hear a girl named Sam, Samantha so she can play around with your while you try to find a way to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ her. Then the Story ends where she says 'My Father has a Plan' A plan to get a good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ she â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing made this Playtime â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Nazi German Sciencetist can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ her. While her dad is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing, shrek and Fiona in the same room. Then comes the WAFFLEGUN 3000 where the zombies eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing waffles and die but some Diesease called Autism they love that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in their mouth soo much thats why they always Scream and Moan. Muilitplayer is just a bunch of 6 yrs old thinking they are playing WORLD OF TANKS LIKE WTF! 101/10 this game is very gr8
784	0	a	unblievably awful pc port, only reviving factor is mods, and most are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
785	0	a	No servers and crashes quite often.
786	0	a	Only worth for zombies. Even that gets old.
787	0	a	Why did i get this game??? 
788	0	a	What to say about World at War? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking, 'Why is the multiplayer dead?' The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hickers and children. Hickers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hicker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warfare 1, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hickers and cheaters.  Some examples of hickers in World at War, are people who use:  Wallhickers Aimbots Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks Hud-Hicking (Yes, it does exist) Instant VAC Ban  The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in WaW that are safe.  Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.  If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the spec-ops, and the singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play WaW. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hicked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hickers...  -Cheers   old cod better   0/10 (can I get it any lower??)
789	0	a	I really enjoy this game apart from one thing which is forcing me to give it a bad review, when i was playing zombies with my mates we were on a high round and i needed to quickly search something on the internet, doing so caused me to 'lag out' and i was kicked out of the game! All you zombie players will know how frustrating that would be to get kicked out on a high level. If this gets fixed my review will be changed
790	0	a	multiplayer dosnt work
791	0	a	i used to love this game on xbox but do not touch this version there is almost no populated servers its insanly hard to find a zombies match with people and the multiplayer is full of a bunch of dooshbags who want you to crouch or you get kicked for playing the game you payed for the way you want
792	0	a	cant load the game with out it crashing
793	0	a	IT WONT LET ME PLAY ZOMBIES! 
794	0	a	COD:WAW is awesome but Personally I would still play it on console. The reason why is that it crashes for ANY i3 Processors right when you open it
795	0	a	The fact that on steam summer sale of 2015 this game is 25% off and still is $15 and says it was originally $20 when i bought it a year ago for $15 not on sale is why i dont trust activision and treyarch anymore.
796	0	a	idk i bought this 2 days ago and now its not working and i dont have a desktop shortcut anymore i like the game but it wont let me play it anymore
797	0	a	Absalout â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wont open Â£20 in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bin. Go kill yourseld founder of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game.
798	0	a	Crash fest
799	0	a	i cant find one zombies server this game sucks 
800	0	a	the game dosnt work 
801	0	a	Tactical pc master race ruined the game 0/10 would not crouch again
802	0	a	One of the biggest wastes of $ I've done. 2/10
803	0	a	Worst game ever. All the bad stuff of all Call of Duty parts combined in one sack of money-making cowpooop. Badly scripted and terribly timed 'action'. Unplayable. Unenjoyable. Strongly not recommended.
804	0	a	Too many hackers. I played this game for 3 hours and I still have not found a server with no hacker. THIS GAME â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SUCKS!
805	0	a	I bought this game because of the reviews. Don't believe them - this game is horrible. Btw - Kiefer Sutherland is your platton sgt in the first level. If you like this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yelling at you for a half hour, have at it.   1) completely linear - one and only one way to get through any and every mission  2) no matter how skilled you are, you will die and die and die again, until you follow the mission perfectly, the way they intend for you to play  3) lots of invisible walls and 2 foot hedges you can't jump over   4) lots of triggers based on your movement - dumb and dumber programming  5) you are the slowest runner and or crawler that has ever served in the military  6) invisible grenades come out of nowhere and kill you, even when every enemy within grenades-reach is dead (this game cheats like a btich - the enemy always knows your position, no matter how well covered you are, or how much stealth and time you take approaching)  7) I could go on, but why. I guess this would be a good game for unimaginative people who need to be hand held the entire time, and think a good game consists of dying until you discover the secret passage through each level
806	0	a	such a bad game. like playing atari. very cheap graphics.
807	0	a	first of all ,from what i can tell punkbuster does not support this game anymore.you have to download some shaddy files from the the internet( pb setup legacy) or use a p2p service like (tunngle) or( hamachi) .which brings up alot of concerns because you dont know if your getting a virus from the the p2p connection or from the shaddy file ...dont download this game unless you have a thid party virus software installed .while the game itself is a great game, its not worth all the headache to get it to work. 'its better to go for black ops if your looking to play zombies'
808	0	a	The multiplayer zombies does not work
809	0	a	I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE I SPENT 20$ ON IT AND ALL I GET IS A BLACK SCREEN WITH MUSIC AND NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
810	0	a	7 years later still more than 1000 player in game , the M P on this thing is something . but u cant find some 1 to play COOP Campaign mod , its sad becouse the Campaign on this thing is awesome .
811	0	a	id recommend this game but not on PC. for those of you who are considering getting this game, STAY AWAY. it is dead. i mean, most of us buys it for the zombies, but you cant even find it anywhere! you might have better luck on ps3 or xbox, but world at war on steam is extremely problematic. yes, the idea of modded servers is fun, but good luck trying to connect and what not. bought it hoping i could re-live the glory days of high school, but was left extremely disappointed. stay away at all costs, ruined christmas for me. 1/10
812	0	a	pretty awful game
813	0	a	theres no zambies
814	0	a	I miss the gore and sound of breaking bones and imapcts. Good one still, yet, cheaters like 100% aimbots, wallcheats, etc. are riding this one too as the CoD4 and no one does anything about it.
815	0	a	Treyarch and Activision can go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ themselves with their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor games and terrible excuses for a video game company. If I see any of you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the streets I am going to smack the color off your face.
816	0	a	how do u creat a profile
817	0	a	biggest peice of wank ever for your everday gamer just otter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to set up a game its lkike â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rocket science pls give me my money back you you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game
818	0	a	I've played World at War on Xbox, Playstation and now PC. I've had a positive expierence on both Xbox and Playstation but not on PC simply because it's way out of it's time and a joke to play. There's only a handful of servers with more than 2 people in them. I really would love to enjoy this game again but that won't ever happen again. At the time of writing this there's a whopping 419 people playing it. I figured it would have more active people on PC but I was wrong. On a plus note custom zombies maps are always fun to play around on. I would have rated this a thumbs up about 5 years ago. Rest in peace WaW.
819	0	a	can give my friend the game for free its his birthday
820	0	a	1.Spent the first 30 hours looking for lan fix so i could play zombies.  2.Spent the next 5 hours trying to get lan fix to work.  3.Spent the last 2 hours crying on my keyboard hoping for my $60 to appear in my wallet again.  Thanks Treyarch
821	0	a	This is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid. they make the controls so hard to set for controler like what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who would like to use mouse and keyboard for a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing xbox and ps3 game?
822	0	a	Day 1:It works Day 2:It works but the campaign crashes next level Day 3:comepletley Broke down  Would not reccomend it to a poor gaming computor.
823	0	a	I dont know why but it wont launch correctly and wont let me play 
824	0	a	not good you kill japs because ww2. since japan is better than america in every way this game i not like because not realistic bad.
825	0	a	this game gives me massive boners when i play with my willy haha lol m68 xDDDDD i really enjoy the exo abilities and how small my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is haha anyway
826	0	a	A lot of Camping. If I could get a refund... I would.
827	0	a	Don't buy this game and just watch the forums.  When the key problems are fixed and the Punk Buster isn't being completely... non-existent from the game's directory (causes a kick upon killing enemy players in online) then buy this game.  As it stands, I'm jealous that my dad can kill more than 1 guy without being kicked due to hte punk buster not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing working. All i can do is campaign, which i've beated like... 4 times so there's no point, and there's zombies aswell.  Until those problems are fixed, this game is only worth ten bucks IMO in today's game market.   I would so love to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play multiplayer. Gee, this game's online is more unplayable than Sonic '06.  I'll give this... a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in... 4/10.  Because Zombies.
828	0	a	Loved it on Xbox, but I have an error that I just cant seem to fix. I've tried uninstalling completely with revo uninstaller and changing sound.. The game has a black screen and has no sound.  If anyone has a fix to the problem, add me
829	0	a	Multiplayer no longer works without going through hell in modifying punk buster files manually. Will take you average 5 hours.
830	0	a	this game is incredibly good but please dont waste your money, its overpirced and dosent work half the time
831	0	a	When I try and play the game it crashes. After doing some research this seems to be a common problem and no one seems to know of a definite solution. Do not buy this game. Treyarch continually ignores the pc audience. There are countless optimization problems and just all around laziness on the part of the developer when porting this game to pc. Steam has no warnings about compatability issues and a notoriously terrible refund policy. Don't waste your money on this overpriced 6-year-old broken piece of software.
832	0	a	Casual review for a casual game. AI: 0/10 - they won't kill each other at the hard difficulty. Scripting death sequences and other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥: 10/10 - Treyarch is good at writing scripts and stuff. Trickshooting: 5/10 Map Design: 7/10 - You can see poorly mapped areas, Treyarch probably thought that you ain't gonna see their messy mapping. Engine: 1/10 - As you know, they still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IW3 engine, which was used in CoD4. Even more, it was used in Black Ops 2 (yeah, modified, still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥), they'll probably re-use it in Black Ops 3 (cuz why the hell we should upgrade our engine, when Quake 3's still serves us good with our â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ coding (gun with an attachment counts as different gun in the code, also haxers recode their cheats in no time, thanks for using same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for many years). Overall: Minus 10/10.
833	0	a	this sucks
834	0	a	I want my monney back.  its really laggy i dont know how to get onto zombies (it will probably be to laggy to survive even with mods)  get it on your xbox 360 or ps3 and it will be much better trust me.
835	0	a	Garbage garbage garbage garbage, this was the first mistake they made in the series and it lead to so many more. I loved Modern Warfare 1 so much and then this came out and made me very sad. Then Modern Warfare 2 came out and I was excited and then everything went to hell.
836	0	a	The Multiplayer is unplayable The campeign is excellent and if that is what you want then definetly get this game but the multiplayer is so ridden by hackers it is unplayable
837	0	a	This game is pretty   avarage  .     Campaign is completely uninteresting, mediocre, avarage. Multiplayer is terribly balanced (otherwise it would be OK).  Singleplayer is as shallow and bland as it could ever be. There's literally no story, it's just a set of random missions that were selected from WWII history. It crashes every two hours of playtime. There's literally no player interaction in co-op, except for reviving. Characters are uninteresting. The only advantage of this game is the COD engine - thanks to which, the game plays smoothly and movement is very responsive.  Multiplayer is slowly dying, you'll only find a few servers that are left running. Most of them are meat grinders (remember 24/7 Operation Metro TDM in Battlefield 3?). The balance is completly terrible - there's no nuke killstreak, because submashine guns pretty much do the same thing. Tanks look good on paper, but in reality one of the factions always conquers all the tanks at the beginning of game, thus the other team already lost the game, because they're facing a squad of almost-indestructible camping tanks.  Customisation is almost non-existant, you just choose your guns and two perks.  Don't get me wrong - the game is NOT a disaster, it's not the worst experience ever. But it isn't anything great either and it could have been better with more effort put into right things. Also I don't find it worth of the money - even though the game is old, you won't find the steam version for less than 10â‚¬.
838	0	a	I thought this was a good game but i cant even open the f*cking game
839	0	a	Waste of money, even with it being on sale.   Unless you can get it for $5, dont waste your time cause no one plays zombies anymore.
840	0	a	i love this game , but when you play online ,punkbuster does not conform to this , which is a big problem and because of this i would not recommed .
841	0	a	The game is meh, at best. It may be a really good game in 2008; but due to the excessive milking to the series, the online community has shrinked to a handful of full lobbies. You often need to disable punkbuster in order to play online. The only lobbies that you could play (really) is a crouch-prone only hardcore lobby, a boosting lobby (where you stand and let others shoot you), and the rare 'vanilla' servers.  If you want to play this game for its campaign, it is rather fun, but there is little replay value. Zombies, it is really fun, and it is better compared to the consoles, because you could enable dev's command and enable godmode, etc.  The only thing I liked about this game is that they gave out free maps, when on the consoles there are 3 DLC's for about $10(?) each. I wish that the game's community/playbase was more larger and alive. (This game was the last good and well-done ported COD game.) 
842	0	a	Bought the game was hyped for it. When I wanted to go online IT DIDN'T â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING LET ME!! I tried to get in, but there was no solution. I searched everywhere in google to find a solution but no I got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing scamed!! Wished I can do a refund. If i can please inform me.
843	0	a	DOESENT WOTK WITH A CONTROLLER ,, NEED KEYBOARD AND MOUSE TO PLAY HARD TO CONTROLL
844	0	a	the zombie mode is missing in the german version. i am really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off!
845	0	a	Piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ doesn't work on high-grade computers.    GG Activion. Great Job!
846	0	a	My laptop is 4gb RAM and it still lags, even with the texture and graphic settings to the bottom, i dont know why it still does this
847	0	a	Multiplayer not supported!
848	0	a	This game sucks i get kicked by punkbuster every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥n time i kill someone. Although I can't really expect anything else from a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game like COD.....Thanks Obama.
849	0	a	be aware that this game may not work even in windows 7 
850	0	a	THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME EVER MADE YOU MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!! 1/10 -IGN
851	0	a	Can't even play the game. I move around and then I immediatly lose connection. Not my internet for sure since I ran some tests and watched videos on 1080p. I dont like this game
852	0	a	this game is a pice of crap unless you like to play on your own i suggest you never get this game it is crap and says it is multiplayer and coop but it isn't it just kicks you out when you kill someone and when you go to play with your friends it says THIS SERVER IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE it is crap never get this game unless you want to waste your money!!!!!!!!
853	0	a	F*** COD. play Counter Strike instead.
854	0	a	Crashes every single time I beat Mission 2 and fails to save beforehand. Not optimized too well for Windows 8.1, I'm assuming. It is an older game so I expect it to have some issues with newer versions of Windows, but... Not such a severe issue. I've tried changing every graphic settings and checked for driver updates and nothing helped. Wasted $19.99...
855	0	a	worst decision of $20 in my life.
856	0	a	Okay game. Worth $2.50.
857	0	a	hafbhhbsajfbjkdfhb it sucks??????? yes indeedeb i caNT SPELL PLZ HELP ME FART 
858	0	a	can someone please help me. i have put 3 holes in my wall with a screwdriver because my coop isnt working. i am about to stab a little puppy in its used to be testicle spots until i get this god damn mother â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ server as nickelback thing fixed. i like this game and wish that i wouldn;t nhave to stick stuff up my dogs â™¥â™¥â™¥ to play this with my friends. just to get it clear, when i try to join friends game, 'trying to join potential matches' comes up. i think that treyarch should get there ten fingers out of there â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s and get there â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of it instead if you know what i am saying.
859	0	a	The story is very exciting,I like it,but the multiplayer is badly.Because there is almost nobody playing it.The health of enemy in multiplayer is higher than COD Infinity Ward series,not interesting like MW series and ghosts,even COD2.People who play it is less than COD2,so it isn't worthy to buy
860	0	a	It's alright, but it gets quite boring after a while.
861	0	a	Worse game ever all ppl do is camp prone all day jerk each other off
862	0	a	Punkbuster wont let me kill anyone in multiplayer lmfao
863	0	a	I'm rating this bad because the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game de-ranked me!!!!!!!!!     But fun to play
864	0	a	Cool game, too bad about the aimbotting AI.
865	0	a	i bought the game and it didnt come with zombies. so dumb!!!
866	0	a	This game is terrible because Russians are a playable race.
867	0	a	I tried to play this man I tried. But everyone on this game is such a try hard and I can't get any kills. I think the highest kill streak I got was 2.. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING 2! And the movement in the game is extremely weird. I think I'm used to the new COD movements. And when I get in a gun ight with someone I aim right at them and shoot but they don't die. I think I'm only going to play this game for zombies.
868	0	a	five little monkeys jumping on the bed one fell off and bump his head mama call the dokter and dokter say no more monkeyz jump on bed
869	0	a	The online community is dead. there are very few servers with players, and the ones with players will have about 40 people. Guess how 40 people on a call of duty map works out.
870	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
871	0	a	I wouldnt recommend World at War for the simple reason that there isnt enough servers and game-mode variety. Every game is hard-core and you cant find a game in Co-Operative.This game was probably worth the money 4 years ago but now its nearly a joke for online which is where its most enjoyable.
872	0	a	I would recommend this but actvision seem to think that Â£1 = $1 so i recommend 1 of these 4 ways.   1. Waiting for it to go on sale on a website like  amazon.com  or any other website that doesn't use pounds this one would be the safest but you would be having to wait (or buy it off sale would still be cheaper).  2. Use a VPN this would be the more difficult one out of the 4 due to them being slow and finding one that you can use.  3. Get someone to buy if for you this is the way i did it but i would recommend getting a friend that you can trust to do it because get a some you don't know to do it they could easily take the money and run.  4. Buying it with TF2 keys this is be the best one out of the 4 IMO because people on trading websites like tf2outpost put trades up for it that use the price of it when its on sale (this only when the game is on sale)you also can buy TF2 keys for cheap from the community market its just finding some on outpost that is selling it for the sale price because of the websites crappy auto bump feature.  Its a shame because this is a very good game but i just cant recommend something that thinks that $1 = Â£1
873	0	a	I bought this game on Steam to play Custom Zombies in combination with multiplayer... Zombies do work so far I've tested (just Der Riese so far) and than I tried out the multiplayer. That doesn't work, at all. If I launch the multiplayer a black screen appears and I have to reboot my PC because nothing happens, if I run it in safe mode the main menu layout appears but than again, it freezes and there is nothing I can do... And I'm not the only one. On the CoD WaW forum on Steam there are multiple people with the same problem: black screen. So my advice for this moment: Don't buy the game until there is a workaround.
874	0	a	DON'T BUY THIS PEICE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ STEAM RAN OUT OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CD KEYS THE DAY I BOUGHT IT FUUUUUUUUUCK YOU STEAM  - Love, Joe
875	0	a	Call of Duty........ The WHOLE of the franchise is over rated, I buy them anyway because they might be different,,, I was wrong  Pros:  Badass story/Badass Guns Creative multiplayer maps   Cons: Everyone hacks hacked lobbies graphics unknown glitches with punkbuster  Overall: Wouldnt suggest buying this game, unless you have friends to play with.
876	0	a	Multiplayers dead unless you like gay tatical servers, and zombies and campaign isn't worth $40
877	0	a	this is a terrible game they make you play through the whole campaign so you can play zombies which is the real reason anyone would actually bye this game s so screw you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
878	0	a	+classic COD style game play +WW2 guns +dedicated servers   -Not much of a active online community as other modern CODs. -90% of servers are filled with bots or one of those stupid 'tatical' servers -Game play pretty much rips off COD4. -keither sutherland's annoying voice screaming all the time.  in conclusion, buy COD4 if u want modern COD games or COD2 if you want WW2 CoD.
879	0	a	it has a glitch where u cant play online
880	0	a	Just purchased this game and cant create an account. Just like many other users none of the solutions work and it doesnt look like they care to fix it just took my 20 bucks
881	0	a	Hey, are you tired of all the World War II FPS games? No? You will be after this. Boring, dumb, 'shock' singleplayer, a listless and awful multiplayer community. The only reason to get this is because of Nazi Zombies, which is easily the best game mode. And even then, I only recommend buying it at the price of $5.
882	0	a	The zombie mutiplayer part is awesome, the rest sucks!
883	0	a	Crashes so much it is unplayable on the pc.
884	0	a	Online will not work, connection fails everytime, want my money back, stupid rip off, offering things that dont even work

886	0	a	The single player campaign is pure garbage. The whole game is just tossing thrown grenades back at the enemy. The multi-player is nominally better than MW1. This is the game that made me realize each new CoD game is just going to be the same as the last one. Easily the best maps are the ones with tanks, but there's only a small number of those and nobody plays them anyway. And since Bad Company 2 exists and does vehicles (and everything else too for that matter) so much better, I can't think of a reason to ever play another CoD game again. It's a real shame to watch this franchise degrade from amazing, breath-taking experience to a lowest-common-denominator soulless unimaginative money-milking machine.
887	0	a	If you like crouch servers, then you're litterally the scum of the earth.  Zombies is fun still to this day and all maps are free, but there is no multiplayer servers unless you're one of those people who love having their farts smelling like male sperm then there are crouch servers. Too many god damn crouch servers.   To the people who like crouch servers, thanks for ruining one of the best Call of duty game's in the franchise.  P.S   SCREW YOU!
888	0	a	this game has no volume it dosnt seem like that big of a dealbut when your playing zombies or anygame type you cant hear anything and your chance of death increases. From what i see this game has apsolutly no way to fix this you can watch tutorials but you'll just be wasting your time if there was a way to get rid of this game i wouldnt even think twice.
889	0	a	A very poor game, especially for a WWII genre shooter which has been done right so many times. Right from the very first level you understand quickly how this is very far from the old call of duty games made by IW. God awful soundtrack, weak strory telling, dull weapons and a downgrade in graphics engine compared to CoD4 are the highlights that made the campaign an utter garbage.
890	0	a	it worked but then dosen't load up ;-[

899	0	a	how do u play zombies in this game? 
900	0	a	I would highly recommend this game to people I hate. Now let me be clear, I liked the console version of this game. It was one of my favorite games. The PC version makes me want to strangle myself with my xbox controller. Yes, I like using a controller. First time I made the mistake of trying to play the game I got an error message and had to reinstall the thing. That was the highpoint.  No one is on the servers. Maybe they are but if so they are doing a fantastic job of hiding themselves. I do not understand why you can join servers where no one is playing. I think most of my 'play time' is me waiting for things to work or looking at a bricked loading screen. Game is buggy as hell.  If you want a smooth console shooter experiance on the pc, look elsewhere this game is NOT FOR YOU.
901	0	a	This game reminds me of a peice of moldy bread that no one wants to eat. This game gave me severe rashes all over my body and my pubic hair grew wildly and hurts when I wear pants.
902	0	a	brought this game for zombies to play with my friends and then tried to setup a server so me and my friends could play but we could not join each other, we tried multiple fixes and they did not work i was very disapointed with this.
903	0	a	This game sucks! You have to play the whole campaign before you can play zombies and the only reason I bought it, is for nazi zombies! I already went through the whole campaign on xbox so I don't want to have to do it again just to play zombies.
904	0	a	multi-player is weak get ghost its better
905	0	a	CSGO IS BETTER
906	0	a	why would you buy it mine doesn't have zombies

909	0	a	This game details world war one's pride and suffering in a mediocre, senseless â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing way.
910	0	a	There are not exo jump suts in this game!!!!??? WHAT IS THIS CIVEL WOR!? WHERE ARE TE TSUPPLOY DROPS?! WHERE ARE THE DARK MTATER CAMOPS!!!???? THIS IS A UNFINSHED GAME!
911	0	a	It's a call of duty game. therefore it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. BATTLEFIELD &gt; Call of dooty.  p.s - I only bought this one because Jack Bauer does voice acting in it and it was on sale.  10/10 would Jack Bauer again.
912	0	a	This is the worst cod game I have ever played that was made my this company. You can go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself right in your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I would rather play some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ exo suit advanced warfare type â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Ahdubs is so much better than this crap. You can't even quickscope and I can't trickshot the noobs so I don't know what to do. This game is so boring and anyone who pays the money for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is a complete dumbass and should drink some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bleach and hand themselfs at the same time. You can't even play with your brother if you both had the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game! you would have to be on different â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing internet connections to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play I hate your guts and your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful programing and I think that you should really improve your programming before you realease your game. COD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ghosts is better than this peice of worthless â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I spent my money on. Now I want a refund so that I can have my money back... Maybe I could buy my girlfriend some candy cause thats what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing girls like you hear that you video game nerds they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing like candy so why don't you get your girlfriend some candy and see what she does ! oh wait! you don't have a girlfriend because you are the biggest video game nerd now â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off.
913	0	a	I would have to say that this game is definately one of my favourite games especially the zombies but it's far too complicated and time wasting just setting up the custom zombies and I can not seem to play with friends which is really disappointing considering I love playing zombies with friends! I've spent more hours finding out how to download custom zombie maps and researching how to play co-op with my friends (since it won't work) instead of playing the game itself. I liked this game but hated it since I couldn't even play co-op.
914	0	a	Only buy this if you want to play those god awful 'tactical' crouch servers only to crouch around like an idiot and get yelled at for running. Btw I just run. Don't spend on it.
915	0	a	Bought it for the multiplayer... bad idea. people will kick you, cheat, and steal your money through your account. do not buy, this is a warning
916	0	a	Junk game, the servers do not work cant login to account and your settings reset each time the game restarts. Buy rust instead!
917	0	a	I was going to give this game an amazing review, but I typed 'exec default_controller.cfg' into the console during an online game to enable the xbox controller, and somehow it showed up in the chat so everyone could see it, and then I got banned from playing online! WTF? Not cool.
918	0	a	this game is cool
919	0	a	im not able to play zombies why is that
920	0	a	put a work shop in this so we can easily download maps
921	0	a	why cant i play zombies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
922	0	a	I just spent $20.00 on this game and it wont let me play it Srry mate
923	0	a	If you are looking to play custom zombies with friends dont buy this game because for some reason it will not allow you to join any invites and you would need to download something calle tungle (And tungle might be a virus) I hope this saves you a pretty penny!
924	0	a	The game is fun when you are playing with people who don't share the same internet as you. 
925	0	a	10/10 would fap to hackers again 
926	0	a	WTF I PURCHASED THIS GAME AND THE NEXT DAY ( today ) IT SAYS I HAVE TO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PURCHASE IT AGAIN. I HAVE NO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MONEY IN MY STEAM WALLET. STEAM IS TO POOR TO OWN A STEAM CONTACT SUPPORT NUMBER. LIKE WTF I GOT RIPPED OFF!!
927	0	a	My version does not have zombies wtf this is why i bought it.
928	0	a	I wrote no as my final answer although I was very in between: If you want this game to play online, whether it be TDM or War, this is not for you. The servers are all shut down and it's a pain in â™¥â™¥â™¥ trying to find one that's up and running. If your buying this to do absolutely nothing but play by yourself, knock yourself out.
929	0	a	their is no zombies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
930	0	a	Play with your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ instead.
931	0	a	I would highly recommend this game if you play zombies with friends all the time but if not then purchase with care. The game overall if great, however most of the game lobby you find is hardcore which I don't mind. The only bad thing is that the servers, because I played a couple game then got perma ban for no reason. Decided to play on another server.....an hour later perma ban again for no reason. So in the end I got perma ban from all the good populated good ping servers. If you are looking to play singleplayer or zombies with friends then yeah go for it, if not don't bother wasting the money.
932	0	a	I Really want to play this Game but it doesnt want to work
933	0	a	Peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ only wanted to play zombies figures out even tho the game has maps for it i need a mod downloads the mod says im not running the mod zombieX even tho i luanched said mod keeps saying session is no longer avalible now dragging nutsack thro a desert of broken glass and rusty nails is a better game 10/10
934	0	a	This game crashed on me while playing the Nazi Zombies co-op gamemode with my friend and i tried playing it again but it would say that it didn't quit properly last time and was asking me to boot into safe or not to. I tried both and both times it resulted in nothing more than a black screen. Someone please help if you have faced simmalar problems! 
935	0	a	Call Of Duty: World At War was a game which i thought looks awesome because of the Custom Zombies which i wanted to play  Unfortunately There is a launch 'bug' for me which sometimes freezes my computer or other times my tv would go to 'no signal'  Is it just me or is anyone else having this 'bug' as well?
936	0	a	zombies on pc is the only good feature  zombies: 10/10  game over all: 45.5/100

945	0	a	-9/11 zombies are too scary
946	0	a	Hmm, Apparently I played this game for 10 hours. I presume I finished it but for the life of me I dont recall.   It obviously didnt grab me in the way it should have.   One slight memory about this game was the level design was terriible. Lots of boxed in areas. Other than that... you have a WW2 game again....
947	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ price for 2008 game
948	0	a	The Game is an Older Game it is Fun in Solo and Plays good . Game takes a nose dive in CO-OP Play which is why I bought it , However it proved not reliable spent hours on blogs and discussion groups most having the same issues I believe in its hayday when servers were avaiable it might have been better but since there are not many servers supporting the coop play it just is more hassle the game refresh for servers also has some problems . Trying to get this to play Coop was a hit and miss normally a miss with continued failures with Friends Play . I Do not Recommned .
949	0	a	Didn't like the game after some time, now I can't get a refund from it for the sale.
950	0	a	In my opinion this is only good for zombies &amp; not worth $20. The fact that you have to beat campaign in order unlock multiplayer zombies wasn't something I was thrilled about &amp; people dont play non-modded zombie maps. It's not super complicated to learn how to install what's needed to join in but it still doesn't make this game worth it with the few servers even availible
951	0	a	My game isnt working it says that it cant load a file and the disc is prob full even tho i have 756 gb on my card
952	0	a	There is no zombies.

956	0	a	It'd be great if you could actually load a Nazi Zombies session with friends and not have to restart your computer from the game crashing.
957	0	a	As someone who couldn't care less about the Zombies aspect of the game the fact that every server is some lame custom server with the worst rules possible, this game is all but dead for me. I hoped that it would still have some more standard servers around that I don't have ridiculous high ping on. Anything over 150 is 110% unplayable, so if you live in the U.S. midwest and only want a WW2 multiplayer shooter, you're actually better off buying CoD 2.
958	0	a	This game sucks it costs 20$ and every time i run it it crashes it stupid
959	0	a	World At War was fine... everything was going great! Until my game broke. The custom zombie maps that i download and play with my friends seems fine to them but to me, models are going crazy. Decals are going haywire. I barely can't even see with something blocking my screen. Gun models does not work and instead are like some sort of blackness covering parts of my screen. I don't like. And then comes the hosting problem. Whenever I try to host a game... I wait.,. and wait for some to join. BUT NOTHING. I have waited on one of my lobbies for over an hour and no one joined. I even went to eat dinner and by the time i come. No one has not joined. I don't even see anything in the chat. Btw... Chat glitch in the game. I can't see what i type sometimes and even in the lobby chat. DONT GET ME STARTED ON JOINING OTHERS... I cant. It doesn't let me. It keeps saying session is unavailable whenever i try to join a friend invite. They say they're still there but i can't join no matter what. It gives me a bunch of errors. I don't even know what to do... I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and still the same ressults.  Is there a refund i can have because i would actually love to take it back and buy it on something else on which it doesn't break down for me.
960	0	a	online wont work glad I got it when it was half price 
961	0	a	I hate Germany...   I can't play zombies because i bought Low Violence Version( And i didn't knew that Low Violence version does NOT include zombies.)! And steam doesn't want to refund me this game.
962	0	a	Story is great Zombies is even better, But for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sakes every single server on this game for multiplayer is hardcore after a while of playing hardcore it gets repetitive and becomes â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t because its who ever see's who first win's it only takes one shot to kill someone on every server it takes no skill at all i mean all you would need to win is a pistol, if your planing on buying this game for the multiplayer its not worth it also the zombie servers are pretty much dead #NoMoreHardcore Kappa
963	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game mainly because I was VAC banned before I even did first time setup. Along with how bad community in CoD game typically are.
964	0	a	I have played this game a lot on the ps3 &amp; xbox 360 &amp; recently purchased it on steam as i was having craving's to play it again. first off the selection of mods is overwhelming &amp; i was impressed with the few that i tried. The main campaign game is much the same as the consoles. Where i was less than impressed was the lack of unmodded multiplayer &amp; nazi zombies co-op play that was available- which is basically non-existant. There seemed to be plenty of mod servers but if you are looking for the challenge that you got playing the classic nazi zombies or mult-iplayer i'm not seeing it here thus far...........
965	0	a	no online community
966	0	a	Bought it for the multiplayer found out punkbuster doesnt support this game anymore and 99% of the servers require the 'newest' version. So now i can only play on cracked servers when I payed for the game. So if you want this for multiplayer get a console version
967	0	a	TERRIBLE GAME. I won't even dignify it by playing it to the end.
968	0	a	I bought this game played for a few days, tried to play it but it said i had to buy it again for $20 again after i bought it IF I WERE YOU DO NOT BUT THIS GAME
969	0	a	This game is without a doubt an arcady first person shooter, just like Call of Duty is know to be. Simple mechanics, decent graphics, and semi accurate story (im not sure the characters in-game actually exsisted), and hey! The first Zombie mode (all WaW DLC maps included). Unfortunatly the ports to the pc arent always good and ive had multiple problems with this game since i bought it (2 years ago). for starters there are a few wierd problems with intel socket GPUs, i would not use it with them since there is a wierd slow down/ speed up when fps goes up and down like a yoyo (This might be different with the newer ones, since i used an intel HD 3000 with 6gb of 1333 sys ram. partly because the iris pro operates with a small amount of ESram, i suppose a ram upgrade would suffice.) But it seems to work with an FX 4100 with 8gb sys ram and a 2gb GTX 660 SC (super clocked).  Now last time i checked the multiplayer was almost empty, since the nature of call of duty is everybody moves to the next game and starts again. and MW2 was incredibly popular. So its hard to find a game online. Not to mention the majority are modded and i expect there are plenty of hackers waiting to prey on your patience, althought it would be completely usless for them.  Since this is the game that brought in the idea of zombie survival, there isnt much too it, compared to BO1/2. Border up windows get money kill zombies that get in, get money, buy new guns, kill more zombies. yadayadayda. Its the mode at its infancy and dont expect the full blown mode it is today.  In hindsight i would not have bought it. But hey! this is to help you guys/girls to decide. But it is my opinion, everyone is different. although the multiplayer being almost empty is a fact.   thanks and have fun!
970	0	a	The only reason for this bad review is because of punkbuster, you cant play online and I have no idea how to fix this. I shouldnt have to fix there game I payed for.
971	0	a	Game does not work anymore. (properly atleast)
972	0	a	THIS SUCKS NO ONE PLAYS MP 
973	0	a	Bad ping for aussie/nz players :(
974	0	a	Dont bother, multiplayer doesnt work right of the start. And this is steam, I wont be bothered downloading patches and third party lan services to play with other people.
975	0	a	It's not even worth buying it. Even though there is custom maps, no one really plays it alot. And why do you suddenly get the worst fps on it when it says 'Works great on intel core 2 duo' When I have Intel Core i3 on my laptop? I just have to spam the refresh list on Co-Op to see if anyone plays. AND MOST OF THEM ARE CUSTOM MAPS! IT TAKES A WHILE TO DOWNLOAD DUDE! Why can't you just host the original maps? I know the Mods feature was big, but everytime I would download a map, the Lobby would disappear cause it's been canceled! I mean like, Vanoss and other gamers play the game, why isn't there more people than expected? Even though PunkBuster no longer supports the PC version of this game, you can still host games! Why doesn't anyone even play it? Multiplayer is the only gamemode with enough people but what about nazi zombies? I've recently played this game and all I mostly see is custom maps instead of Regular maps. 
976	0	a	This version of the game is basically buying a rippd or cracked version. First off the camplain is great and very fun and yes it does have its random bugs and glitches every once in a while just like any good game. Second the multiplayer is nothing like it use to be. Every map has either mods or hackers in it. Pretty much everyone only plays hardcore mode. And people will boost your prestige to max in some lobbies so it means you wont be able to have that fun experiance getting those levels up yourself. Third, There is NO multiplayer zombies. I repeat! NO multiplayer zombies unless you download some off steam program that allows you to technically illegally host a zombies match(steam allows this) and even at that, most of everyone has a closed nat type when you need a open nat type to play. Lastly, a lot of buttons wont even work, they either crash your game or just crash steam fully. And some buttons wont even take you to the right location of where it was suppose to go. SO! If you plan on buying this game for the multiplayer zombies! DON'T GET IT. Unless ofcourse you plan on playing by yourself then go right ahead.
977	0	a	No one plays this anymore :(
978	0	a	As a single player game, it kinda sucks. The levels are 100% linear and confined to a narrow field of play. The player movement is actually very sluggish. It's hard to tell your opponent from your allies and the grenades are a total pain.  Maybe it's a good coop game or multiplayer, haven't tried that yet. 
979	0	a	I am playing the solo campaign and from what I read from the reviews it was hyped up as being awesome. I gotta tell you it is a load of bull. It is really unballanced and will cheat you at every available opportunity. It is so bad that it will have you laughing at it on the harder settings. I guess the multiplayer was great in its day but if you wanted a single player shoot em up then expect to be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when ever the game suits and if you blink it will be over. Just too short for my liking.
980	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ic

982	0	a	Personaly I love his game, like on XBox 360 its perfect but in my case my PC couldnt handle it, and its Windows 10, BRAND NEW. It ran like 10-20x less than it should have. So unless u got an amazing PC, dont buy it. If you do go nuts.

987	0	a	Hardly works â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off waste I want a refund
988	0	a	Really poor effort considering it has a console release yet none of those features cross over. No pad, bad menu and messes up all your desktop settings.
989	0	a	stop being a ungreatful â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WaW &gt;:( 
990	0	a	IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER, DONT GET THIS GAME. they have polite rules where u cant run, you have to be crouched, and you cant spawn kill. Ive been kicked for walking. Ive been kicked from every server from these rules. If you want this for zombies then its a good game but other than that dont get it
991	0	a	it never works and i can not find any real help on how to fix this unhandled exception error wich causes the game to not work really sad would not advise getting
992	0	a	Well i was excited for about half a month waiting for paypal to let me access my funds. Bought the game. spent hours downloading it on my poopy connection finally got the game installed. Started it. and apperently i cannot create an online profile. I guess other people have had this issue. There appear to be fixes for it. however i am stuck. im sure i would enjoy playing this game but im not a programmer... I give up. I would ask for my money back so i could buy MW2 or something else but i know that will not happen. soo I guess I paid for this review. Don't make the same mistake. get COD 4 instead.
993	0	a	its bad now
994	0	a	Game is freaking great, but I had an issue which when I closed it, it was still labeled as 'Running' and I couldn't fix the problem, I contacted Steam Support and told them that this was happeneing, and I had Really only played an hour, and requested a refund, but this glitch cause the hours to stack as much as time passes, and that removed the chance of me getting a refund, great game, but just my luck, so I've been ripped off and can't do anything about it...  10/10 would glitch and get scammed again
995	0	a	The furer was not featured very often in this game
996	0	a	In general this is a fantasic game but one problem that my friend and I had encountered ruined the whole experience. We were hyped to start playing so I created a lobby, send an invite......  Server no longer available!  After trying to fix this, there was no choice but to give up. If you want the game for solo play and pre-made online games (which is hard to find a non-modded lobby) I recommend but if in a case in which you want to play with friends, another platform with dedicated servers may be the best way to go.
997	0	a	I spent hours working on the Veteran Mode difficulty setting, and was in the Reichstag. I signed off, and went to bed. The next morning, I found that all of my data was randomely wiped. I spent hours suffering through Polonsky's never ending whining, Roebuck and Reznov's cowardice (They never shot their guns in the campaign), a constant rain of grenades, being shot by nothing, clunky AI, useless grenades (all of which were my own), multiple heart-attacks, and a general lack of historical accuracy (The Battle of Shuri Castle never happened, and was not the end of the Okinawa Campaign. Roebuck and Miller would not have likely been sent home either, unless they were at Cape Gloucester or Guadalcanal, as they had not served in three campaigns). All of this was for nothing. I'll never get my fifteen hours back. While this may not be the game's fault, the host of other issues with the game have prevented me from giving it a favorable review.
998	0	a	i hate myself and i go to other steams and steal there to kids are dont do nothing
999	0	a	10/10 This game is Great It ran for 1 hour then crashed and now it crashes before I can even launch it. I searched everywhere and no one knows hot to fix it I re-installed did all that crap and nothing. Thanks Activision!
1000	0	a	Slight issue where it completely crashes my computer every time I try and start the game, this may be because of the specs of my computer But others have had the same or similar issue to me
1001	0	a	If you're like me, you bought this game for console when it first came out on console (way before you had the money to be a pc). The multiplayer was fun and the cooperative elements of the game lead to grow mostalgia for it. Unfortunately, the game hasn't aged well. The multiplayer community is fairly small now given the game's age. This leaves it to be slower paced, as the hardcore fans have stayed to play hardcore game types. It's small size also renders less moderation. Thus, many of the multiplayer servers are flooded with modders. If you're not a modder, you're probably not going to enjoy yourself as much as you would if you had bought the game when it just came out. Also, splitscreen for Zombies and Co-op Campaign is fairly tricky to setup on a pc, unlike console. However, the game is still as gritty as you remeber it.
1002	0	a	big fan of cod but this game is not working properly on steam,i have other cods all working superb but this no,can you answer me why what is wrong  
1003	0	a	Clear path directions  Enemy keeps spawning until you move  One minute they survive a nade and the next they need three body shots from an M1  Call of Duty was fun..... when I was 12.

1007	0	a	This game has problems, but itâ€™s one of the best ones youâ€™ll ever play. I have so many memories with this game on an Xbox, so I decided to get it here while it was on special. The game started on the first try, but itâ€™s a hassle to find a legit multiplayer game. Zombies are fun as always, but you will not find a lot of multiplayer games so get yourself some friends or play it solo.   Pros: Mods Amazing Campaign Multiplayer Zombies  Cons:  Does not save my online multiplayer progress, so Iâ€™m always starting from private Random crashes Not much zombieâ€™s servers Multiplayer is full with modded maps and some hard to find legit ones Bluescreens on my PC  Game will sometimes not even open and stay in a black screen  Youâ€™ll waste way more time trying to fix all of these problems than actually playing, so get ready to read some 7 year old forms and going to some outdated websites no one ever goes to anymore.  This is an awesome game, but its way too complicated on a PC. Iâ€™ll rather play it on a console to just keep it sweet and simple. 
1008	0	a	My look left right up and down are unbound.i have to use arrows to go throught menu cant create online profile
1009	0	a	I have mixed feelings about this game. It's better with friends. Without friends, you have nobody to talk to, nobody to tell what you're planning on doing. It's lonely. The graphics are excusable. But I can't get over the deafening silence of this game, especially in Zombies. I still play, but honestly don't waste your money nor time unless you have someone to play with you.
1010	0	a	I loved this game before and looks pretty good but online doesnt work... :[

1012	0	a	Seems like my experience this game is not like anyone else's but look at this if you want to play with friends using Co-Op. My friend and I are experiencing something wrong with joining using Co-Op on the campagn mode. We've tried hosting lan and online games with no luck of joining. I've search this online to see if there was a fix. Sadly, there isn't. I've tried disabling firewall and much more with no luck. All I get when I join is this session error, ' Trying to join potential matches ' and it never joins. It is very dissapointing seeing a really good game having an error like this.
1013	0	a	REVIEW FOR PVP: I played this game for years on console it is by far my favorit call of dutty and still remains same on pc.  The game breaking problem that pains me about this game right now is that you can't find players that are not on a modded server and punk buster usually kicks you when you find a decently playable server for some reason.
1014	0	a	Wouldnt reccomend at all  Just get Black Ops with all the DLC'S.  Multiplayer is full of hackers Can't play zombies with friends Its just broken.  Campaign is good but if you want to play with friends don't get. Just get Black Ops
1015	0	a	Played it for 2 hours... Now it just crashes. It's odd, but it think it happened after adding acreative sound card
1016	0	a	No matter what I do co op lan doesn't work between my wired desktop pc and my laptop and paying $40 for two copies just so that I can play lan and then it doesn't work.  I have tried port forwarding, restarting, redownloading, hamachi, evolve and turning off the firewall but nothing works and its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed so I do not reccomend anyone to try to buy this for co op as it has a chance of just never working, ever.

1020	0	a	I had some trouble at first getting multiplayer to work. After some time servers started showing up to refresh. Seems to have enough servers for multiplayer and is a good classic CoD game. Hardly ever any zombie games. The multiplayer servers are often empty or seem to require certain files. Some few servers have team deathmatch, but the multiplayer community is a huge dissapointment. Most of the cool servers i tried to join always kick me after i play for some time without telling me why. Only team deathmatch available. . . Sometimes fun, but you cant play splitscreen or with controllers without xpadder either on here. . .

1023	0	a	Aces of the Galaxy is a vibrant rail shooter. The gameplay is very accessible and combat is hectic, and enjoyable. The difficulty levels feel pretty appropriate, however there is even a challenge on Easy mode.   The biggest complaint I have, whether by design or not, is that there is no save state for progression. Every time you exit the game, you and return, you'll start right over. Now this could be an homage to the classic arcade style that this game represents, but for most modern arcade games, a save system is really a requirement I feel. Not having the ability to continue is why I would not recommend this game.
1024	0	a	I cannot recommend this game - it just doesn't work, and the support for it is horrible. I have seen some people who seem to be able to get it to work, and I wish them all the best. For me, it gets to the menu, I cna select a ship, but when I click 'Play', it hangs. Music still plays, but no game. Worst of all, I can only kill it remotely, because it completely takes over the desktop - try to CTRL/ALT/DEL and you can't see task manager because the game is in the way. Can't minimize it. Can't ALT/TAB, because the instant you change windows, the game takes back over again.  And the support. What support? Steam has nothing in the way of support for this game, so far as I can tell. They say contact Activision. Activision has no reference to this game on their site anywhere, and you can't submit a ticket for anything that's not on the site. There is no generic way to contacxt support except Twitter, and so I am now engaged in a days-long Twitter conversation which has barely gotten past the 'have you verified your game cache' stage.  It looked fun, but don't risk it. NOT WORTH THE RISK TO BUY.
1025	0	a	when i bought this years ago, there was the mouse issue.. now the game just doesnt lunch.... i wish i could erase this game, from my library
1026	0	a	Really sloppy control and interface design, and there's no reason to make a PC shooter where you have to keep mashing buttons like this. Graphics are pleasant enough, but were stuck in 4x3 for me. Overall this feels like someone tried to make a more arcade-ish Starfox knockoff, and in doing so lost all of the worthwhile elements of the source.
1027	0	a	Cant really recommend this game. Gameplay is repetative and uninteresting and the controls are hit and miss. looks and sound are good enough, but the game isnt worth your money, there are free flash games out there that are better then this
1028	0	a	I suppose it is an okay game but..  Fun? Yes it actually is and not too difficult either and kind of refreshing.  No saves? I do not have a lot of time to play and thereÂ´s where the lack of a save option stops me from playing further.   Gaming gear used: There was also a problem with my logitech rumblepad, I had to disconnect it to get the game working properly. I had it plugged in for another game but obviously this game does not like that. I used my mouse and keyboard for this game.  Recommend: No. If it only had an autosave/save function then IÂ´d would have voted positive surely.
1029	0	a	Aces of the Galaxy is a competent game that gets on my nerves. Aces reveals console-port-itus by making it impossible to change the controls ingame, and if you have a 360 controller hooked up expect to get lots of rumble you can't do anything about. I was attracted to Aces because it looks and plays a bit like Rez HD. You can move side to side and dodge, but you have no ability to change your path. When executed well, this can be alot of fun. However, shooting in Aces is accomplished by clicking the mouse button instead of holding it. Within the first few minutes of play, I encountered swarms of enemies, and I do mean swarms. You can fire missiles by holding the right mouse button and dragging it over your enemies, but the recharge for this ability encourages you to click away with your guns, and this quickly becomes a pain. Outside of gameplay, two more issues quickly made the experience intolerable. Firstly, the majority of the enemies arn't well-differentiated from the background, the shots they fire back at you, or thier own vapor trails. The result is an incredibly busy, confusing, and deadly mess, and that's before you start adding your own shots to the mix. Secondly, I quickly encontered a piece of music that was ear-splittingly painful, and while I could certainly turn off all the music, I really don't see the point of playing a game like this without decent beats. This is obviously a subjective review, so I encourage you to examine other sources.
1030	0	a	Find a blunt object and start beating yourself in the head with it... I guarantee that will be a better experience than trying to play / troubleshoot / fix your system after installing this POS. I wish I was exaggerating.  
1031	0	a	Crashes to desktop on boot, waste of money.
1032	0	a	It feels like playing a third-person version of Space Invaders, when you can see it.   There's a reason Aces of the Galaxy sits at 'Mixed' in it's reviews: it's not for everyone. Certainly it's not the type for me. While there is something to be said for 'On Rail Shooters,' I cannot say that Aces makes the best of this particular style. In particular, Aces makes use of many many brilliant colors and explosions which happen in such frequency that seeing what is happening is a challenge.  Overall, I can't say that I was enjoying Aces. Had it been a third-person version of Space Invaders, I might have had more fun with the idea, but the novelty of such an idea is hampered by the rail.
1033	0	a	If you're using an i3, i7, Intel Xeon, AMD FX 63xx, FX 83xx, or FX 92xx, or an i5 laptop, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.  Any processor that supports hyperthreading will make this entirely unplayable. Shaders will not load. Polygonal stretching/artifacting is frequent and highly distracting. Objects will clip out of existence from either getting close or getting far from it, revealing the out-of-bounds areas or making NPCs simply float in mid-air. No settings will fix the bug and no fix (other than disabling hyperthreading in your BIOS... hell no) is available. It also has severe stuttering problems, and according to some online sources the bad performance is an AMD specific bug that can't be fixed.  Even more than that, you can't brute-force your way through the game and ignore your problems. Even when you look past the invisible tiling and exposed out-of-map areas, the true game-ending bug is when your UI breaks and a giant black hexagon covers a good chunk of the center of the screen. This makes it near-impossible to aim. Just go play Singularity.  The game itself is interesting and very enjoyable from what I've played, and if not for these shader bugs the Quake4-ish visuals hold up perfectly... but like the original Far Cry or Grim Fandango, the first big challenge is figuring out how to duct-tape the messy, outdated code together, and as of yet I haven't succeeded. Will update review if a solution can be found.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837039396   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837037829   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837037490 
1034	0	a	Timeshift is the prime example of a good concept (time manipulation) badly rendered. The story in itself is utterly slim and unattractive (and with quite the erratic narrative) : a scientist, Krone, decied to found his own empire in an alternate timeline and you go after him. The end. No surprises, no twist, no incentive to continue.  The hero is a soulless mute, joining the Resistance just because and being ordered around, while nobody bats and eyelid at a suit guy appearing from nowhere and able to manipulate time around him. There's a grand total of two timejumps !  But well, story is not meant to be the strongest point of a FPS. Problem is, the gameplay is also lacking. Not that it plays badly- on the opposite, it plays quite smoothly. But the game is far too easy. Your ability to slow time, combined with the quick regeneration of your health and a genous cooldown for time-controlling abilities, makes you near-invulnerable if you stay cautious. The game compensates by unleashing hordes of brainless soldiers, but it just makes the fights longer, not more interesting. The puzzles are short of anything creative. A puddle of electrified water ? Stop the time, the water is solidified, go unscathed. The bridge is collapsing ? Activate return, walk on it as it goes back in time for your needs. It won't challenge your intellect, rest assured.  The weapons feel good, especially the explosive crossbow, but in the end you feel like you spend most of your times pushing buttons and going back. Cooke, the leader of the Resistance, yelling at you every twenty seconds in some sections till you accomplish the objective is quite unnerving.  The game is mercifully rather short- about 8 hours, without replay value. In a way, it's quite soothing because you stomp the ennemies with your arsenal and slow time capacity, but it was really clunky and uninspired at the time, it's not better now.  If you want a FPS with the Time them and a good dose of humor, try Time Splitters : Future Perfect. Else, even Singularity is more convincing than Timeshift : at least you interact with the world, you're not a mute puppet in a suit.  Surely Saber Interactive is doing better now, but then they have also produced Battle Los Angeles... Not the brightest past.
1035	0	a	I don't typically write reviews. I also understand TimeShift is older but its impossible to run on modern core CPUs without the hassle of turning off hyperthreading in the BIOS. I write this negative review only as a warning to those interested in buying the game. TimeShift itself is actually really fun and I hate to taint the review status because of this issue. However, Steam should really warn people of these problems before selling a product. Out of hundreds of games I own this is the only one that I have to do this with in order for the game to work. Such a pain in the %^#!
1036	0	a	I loved this game when it came out, and remember playing it on my old laptop. unfortunately, with my PC this game is unplayable. it doesnt have support for newer hardware, and it's now an unplayble wreck. I had to request a refund, because I just can't play this game
1037	0	a	Don't look at my play time. I used another exe (not for this game, obviously) to get 5 minutes to write this review. Maybe my review would help somebody.   Game doesn't work if you have Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 x64
1038	0	a	So i did some research and found that this game crashes if you enable interlacing, which is something that has to do with your gpu and how it streams its data that almost every modern gpu uses by default, which has to be changed in the B.I.O.S. Which makes it confusing how I managed to play about a half an hour of this before it crashed in game, and loading a save only made it crash again during the loading screen, and the community seems to not have a fix for it. Starting a new game also didn't work in case you didn't think I tried. Downvoting until i hear it's fixed, odds are with a game this old now it will never happen. Really fun though, controller pretty much necessary.  Edit: So I looked at this review and realized that I pretty much didn't cover any of the game I actually played, so in short, it has some decent puzzle elements, like stopping a fan blade over a death pit and walking across per say, or walking up to a dude, taking his gun and punching him in the face. You would not believe how much fun that is until you try it. I've played through most of the game on my friends ps3, which is why I picked it up, however I'm still dissapointed that there isn't a solution for my problem no matter how hard I look, considering my BIOS is apparently crap and I don't have interlacing options. This is a good game, and I reccomend picking it up, just not on PC, I hate to say it.
1039	0	a	This game is the dictionary definition of mediocre. While there is nothing blantantly wrong with it, it does not excel in any department either. Being able to control time at will sounds like a great mechanic but it is poorly implemented in this game. During combat all you need to do is slow down time and you become virtually untouchable. which takes away any sort of tension during firefights. It seems the develepers tried to account for this by making enemy fire highly lethal (meaning a couple of shots to the face and you're dead), and by having enemies ambush you -- as if they come out of nowhere -- resulting in constant reloadings back to the previous checkpoint. Even having purchased this game on sale I cannot recommended it since, despite giving it an honest try, it offers no entertainment value. 
1040	0	a	I honestly do not understand how others can give such good reviews, though that may be explained by the fact that EVERY negative review, no matter how well founded and well written is marked as unhelpful, when many are very accurate. I found this game clunky and quite silly in some respects. A major issue I had is the number of bullets you must put into enemies, though there is at least enough ammo dropped to refund you there. But when it takes vital extra seconds to make sure they're definitely dead after that nearly 20 bullets point-blank, that then causes you to die repeatedly from the sheer volume of AI surrounding you, that each seem able to severely cripple you, then it becomes rather annoying. The controls are not exactly set up the best as default either, and it doesn't help when you have to use those strange controls to stop the game using the 'amazing' time powers (which are not able to be utilised as well as they could) for you and wasting the charge on them, as well as throwing off any rhythm you manage to achieve. Overall, though it has potential to be enjoyed, and I am sure many can, I do not reccomend it for those reasons, as I believe that it has not the quality to have enough fun to be worth it. Feel free to try, however, as it may get better later in the game. I couldn't bother to continue after a while.
1041	0	a	I tried changing the FOV (the default is 56) and it glitches the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the game any time I try to. I got this on sale for $5 but it kinda sucks because I can't play with an FOV lower than 80 without motion sickness. If you can deal with 56, then it might be for you because the gameplay isn't that bad, but I simply can't recommend it for that reason.
1042	0	a	I could only play three levels of this game. I think by that admission we know where this review is going.   I don't know why I bought this game, if it was in a bundle, or if I mistook it for another time game, what ever the reasons, I wish I could give it back. It's not that it's a horrendous game, but with a name like Timeshift, you have a lot of great possible features that will blow a players mind.   This game though doesn't do any of them. This is a very by the numbers shooters with a time power that is almost mandatory. In the first three levels, you constantly feel overwhelmed, but the time power doesn't really make up for it, a lot of this game is use the time power, shoot a few people, hide again wait for the time power (And health) regen, do it again.   The abilities you have in the game are interesting, but the game overall is quite uninteresting. The story is weak, the gameplay is about the same, and the graphics... well the first level is a dull grey, with enemies running around, and while there's big enemies you can't fight (yet?) overall you're running around dull hallways, shooting dull enemies, running in parks, in drab environments, shooting dull enemies, the game never really evolves beyond the dull lack luster experience that it starts with.  Who knows, the fourth level might be the best level in video games ever, but I couldn't stay interested long enough to e even reach it. And I have a feeling you'd be shooting the same drab enemies over and over.
1043	0	a	Competent, yet completely average and uninspired shooter. Ultimately, Timeshift feels just gimmicky - and it exhausts it's bag of tricks very fast. I had fun shooting an explosive bolt into a guy's head with time frozen and watching him suddenly become inert gibs. A couple of the weapon are very interesting, regardless - a submachine gun with incendiary rounds and attached flamethrower was different enough to become a favorite -, but their designs are, again, uninspired (What the hell is that assault rifle?!), and the audio and feedback lacks any punch (though the shotgun WILL send people flying... after maybe two or three shots at close range.) The game quickly devolved into slow-motion dashing through cover while waiting for the limited time-resource to recharge. In the end, Timeshift didn't offer enough freedom to abuse my timepowers nor enough challenge or solid gameplay to constitute a good shooter - in this regard, it didn't achieve either a sandbox I could blow steam off in nor a challenging game I could be engaged in. Instead, it forced me to play it like a shooter with a fun-but-repetitive gimmick I could enjoy every forty seconds - and it doesn't have enough foundation as a shooter to force me into that. F.E.A.R. provides a far more enjoyable experience - in which the time effect, while not as varied - supports a much better game - and one that stands on its own without the gimmick.
1044	0	a	Bland world doesn't develop as you progress, same assets are used everywhere. Story after the introductory CGI only gets worse and worse. The final battle is just meh.  After almost 10 years still has game breaking bugs. At certain point it's impossible to progress if the barrels are destroyed by scripted event, the grate is not thrown away by explosion and you have to explode the barrels yourself for it unlock the path what's a bit tricky to do. When solving some puzzles the ability timer is drained too fast and you have to constantly retry it until it goes slower for no apparent reason. At certain point it's almost impossible to perform a jump you have to mash whitespace like crazy for it work. I've had to use online walkthrough to find workarounds for that nonsense.  15â‚¬ for this? No, i can't recommend it, it's a bad game, even by 2007 standarts.
1045	0	a	Played the beta of this one, was hyped and cool. Recently bought the full game, spent 2 days on it, we-e-e-ell... No. No is a perfect word.  Time powers? No. Game adjusts timers and cooldowns as creators had planned ahead of you. 'Okay, man, scripted parts are okay, but otherwise you can do what you want!' - again no, your 'mana' meter won't allow you to. It won't be time-travelling kung fu out there, but just spamming Time Stop once in 7 seconds to insta-regen health and continue dodging tons of bullets.  Cool fighting? No. Grab the most overpowered guns in game and hope nobody shpongles charged plasma in your backside.  Cool graphics? Oh well, 2.5 out of 5. Backgrounds and levels are nice and linear, NPC are ugly, and you never see yourself in game. Even hands.  Cool storyline? Err... well, they explained basically nothing. HInts don't tie up into solid story, and there wasn't a solid story to begin with. Even motives and build-up are missing.  Cool multiplayer? Go get Unreal Tournament and forget this, srsly.  Cool cinematics? Yes, 5 seconds each. But hey! - we'll get a nude female once in a while there! Worth it!  My verdict - complete waste of time on our side and questionable waste of money and resources on developer's side. gg 2 ez.
1046	0	a	Mouse acceleration is extreme. Graphics are okay for an old game but the engine is kindof laggy with frequent frame drops and stutters on a i4790k with r9 290..
1047	0	a	If you're going to buy this game, buy the retail version as it is at version 1.2. The Steam Store page for this game doesn't mention that the game hasn't been updated which means you won't be able to make any changes to the video settings if you do manage to launch it succesfully.
1048	0	a	Unplayable, terrible stuttering. Seems to be a problem related with AMD cards.   CPU: i5 4670K GPU: R9 290X OS: W7 64bit
1049	0	a	First of all, my beefs with this game.  -Very short story. -Time powers drain ridiculously fast. -Practically no character interaction or any real explanation as to what's taken place to explain the events of this story. -Obvious setup for a sequel which will never happen. -Unfair mind reading AI which necessitates the need for the time bending powers. If you think good aim or reflexes will get you far, think again. -Another deaf mute protagonist. -No running -Unnecessary kill cam for no reason. -Overall poor execution of what could've been a memorable  Having said that, heres the little that I did like about the game.  -Good graphics for it's time. -Decent textures -4k support -Decent gun mechanics -Very original time combat mechanic and for solving puzzles. -Difficult and challenging.  I feel that for everything this game was trying to do right it, it poorly executed it while tacking on more annoying things than enjoyable. Overall, not worth the $4.99 I paid.  
1050	0	a	Game Crashes before title screen on 64-bit Win10 machine. Not the only one having this problem.
1051	0	a	If you want a mechanical experience that won't disappoint, but won't thrill, grab Timeshift.  Everything about this game is kind of over sold and under delivered. All of the alternate future weaponry looks cool, but none of it has any weight. The storyline is, to be perfectly blunt, as basic as you can get. A faceless, voiceless protagonist, who follows the orders of a ragtag resistance movement helps them obtain victory during certain engagements leading up to an assault on a walking tower ... fortress thing? This is a game that tries to tell you it's a lot grander in scope than it actually is. The plot has enough holes (not only thanks to time travel, but weird, inconsistant writing) to make the stoy not worth actually listening to, and the levels are rail straight, there's no exploration and very minimal interaction outside of 'Slow time down to bypass this air vent,' ....   In fact, if I look back on the environmental interactivity, I'd be hard pressed to list more than 5 different things you really need time manipulation for, and some of those don't make any sense narratively anyways!   Slow Time: Killing Enemies without getting torn to shreds yourself. This is a must. Cover is barely available and your shields are only able to take one or two shots, while enemies can take half a clip or more to kill, and usually come in waves of 6+.   Slow Time: Avoid Environmental hazard A,B,C etc (Ruptured gas lines on fire, electrified pools)  Slow / Stop Time: Avoide Mechanical Hazard A,B,C etc (Fan blades in a vent, Giant Fan Blade over Chasm, Instant kill Cutting laser security beams, more fans)   Reverse Time: Engadge mechanical system which would let you pass through it into the next section, but only if it were going backwards. Open doors, previously opened by something moving through it so you can pass into the next area. Rinse, repeat.   Here's the thing about time manipulation. If you're going to give a player the ability to slow, stop and rewind time by a Phlebotinum powered onesy, for god's sake give them more than 3 seconds of the power in the middle of their firefights. The amount of suit energy any one power would drain was completely different at different times. They don't even try to explain it. Quote Wikipedia:   The key feature of TimeShift is the player's ability to control time: slowing, stopping or even rewinding time more or less at will. This allows a player to stop time to dodge an incoming projectile or steal an enemy's weapon. Specific time-related puzzles also require these abilities. In some parts of the game the time powers are lengthened.  In some parts, the powers are lengthened. Sweet. Caramel. Zombie. Buckshot.   You can literally walk into an area and be killed within a second by enemies who target you. Using the Slow Time power outside of any pre-approved 'tactical recommendations' from the Timesuit's AI results in your suit power being guzzled faster than you can say 'Out of power, on open ground being shot at by ten enemy characters.'   However, in EXTREMELY similar situations, or in situations where there IS no enemy presence, time slow, time stop and even time reverse powers seem to be magically more power efficient. And let's be clear. We're not talking about a local time shift. We're not talking about alternate universe jumps. This is literally a game where they promise to give you the power to bend time as you want, then tell you for no good reason you can't do it for more than a few seconds, when ten minutes ago, you were making it fifteen minutes ago with enough power left over to charge your fitbit.  Zero crunchy combat, promised time manipulation powers that are as railroading as the envrionments, disappointing, prosaic story. It delivers on the action/shooter front and that is it. If it's on sale, and you want an FPS you can tuck away after 7 hours and never think of again, get it. Otherwise, avoid.  Cheers.
1052	0	a	Don't buy it for it's time-manipulation bs - the meter that it lets you control time with is so small a frame that you basically need accelerated senses anyway to slow down time...If your expecting a modern take on Prince of Persia - you DON'T want this.  Also the AI feels a bit scripted instead of natural - case in point: you try to destroy this big yellow mech with allies, the mech heals when you don't shoot it and the allies backing you continuely return to fire and make the same death scene whether you reverse time or not. Basically unless you can 1hit it with inferior weapons and/or make use of the limited time-manipulation reserves you have (something I wasn't able to do) you can't destroy it - however by backing up for cover you also reset the scene so you have to do all this without running back for shelter from it's rockets.  Finally Contrary to popular belief in time-manipulation crowds - you cannnot 'undo' a gameover in this game by reversing time.
1053	0	a	Did not live up to the 2007 Xbox Demo Hype i remembered. Poorly ported to the PC, its controls are clunky and infuriating. The game seems to think exploding a vehicle right next to you without warning multiple times is a good game mechanic. And when it does tell you and you stay away from it, only when you HAVE to walk past it, regardless of any time effects you use (eg FREEZING TIME), it will still explode and kill you.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing disappointed i had to rage quit this game, and i dont do that often.
1054	0	a	Where to even begin. This game is a narrative trainwreck, which sucks because a lot of it has so much potential that you can see rotting on the vine.  First off, this game doesn't handle multiple monitors very well. I've had to turn off my side 2 through nVidia control panel to make it play nice. Every time the game starts up, it opens a little pop up saying I've got incompatible drivers and sends me to nvidia's homepage to download the latest drivers which I already have. Older game, hard to program forward compatibility, but whatever, I can deal with that. Not impressed, but not enough to kill it either.  Gameplay: This is a generic linear corridor shooter with a gimmick of limited time control. You can slow time down, stop time and reverse time. And that's about it. It's not even as much fun as it sounds. What would have been more interesting is an open level approach with multiple solutions, instead of forcing the player down a single path and having the only option to be to shoot everyone. The time control features are introduced within 5 minutes of the opening level, and other than some weapons, thatâ€™s about it. The weapons themselves tend to flip flop between underpowered pea-shooter and BFG9000. Thereâ€™s no character customization, only about 6 weapons total, a few have some alt-fire which is easily ignored and forgotten. A better way of doing this would be a leveling system that lets the player choose how they want to accomplish their objectives: perhaps some would like to do things stealthy, others like the time manipulation tools, still others prefer to load up on heavy armor, big guns, and shoot friends and foes alike until thereâ€™s nothing left but smoking ash. Some variety.   The AI is forgettable. They mostly just stand there, or get into poor cover while shouting about what kind of gun you have, request reinforcements, or repeat the same few canned lines again and again and again. They make up for their stupidity in sheer numbers and by killing you in a few shots.  Story wise, donâ€™t even bother. Youâ€™re dropping into an alternate timeline around 1939, but might as well be 2100 with all the future tech running around. Thereâ€™s the generic evil empire vs the good rebels, but I constantly found myself asking â€œWho are these people and why should I care about any of this.â€ You see some of the present in flashbacks, but donâ€™t expect it to answer any questions. It might have raised a few questions, but by then I didnâ€™t even care.   Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Deus Ex or Dishonored instead.
1055	0	a	Be nice if it worked.   It doesn't.  Boo.
1056	0	a	Extremely boring. Railway 'plot' that has you waiting every few minutes until someone opens a door for you or blows up a wall. Combat is tough not because enemies are smart, but because it takes a full mag to drop abasic mook. Bullet-time rip-off is neat, though. A story might be in there somewhere, but IÂ§m not sticking around to find out.
1057	0	a	It was working a while ago, but stop working now. It says it is incompatible with my driver, which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t because it was working.
1058	0	a	CanÂ´t even play since you need a program that donÂ´t exist anymore.......
1059	0	a	A pretty mediocre shooter with a completely linear gameplay and tons of scripted events. The time-based abilities make for quite repetitive battles when you just slow time down, rush out, shoot a few enemies, then rush back to cover and wait for the suit to regenerate energy. There are some puzzles where you press buttons, stop time and open doors but they aren't interesting. I expected a lot more, based on the hype and the time mechanics.
1060	0	a	Old B-level shooter. With foolish story and stolen from HL2/FEAR gameplay.
1061	0	a	It's fun like a half-life 2 knockoff that uses stop, slow, and reversal of time as a strategy. The two things about this game that I wish the game had is the ability to peak around corners with 'Q' and 'E' or some other combination just like in the stalker games with the ability to prone AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HAVE A 1.3 STEAM PATCH SO THE GAME RUNS FLUENTLY AND DOES NOT HAVE CRASHES AND SAVE GAME CORRUPTIONS!  So as of today I would either sit on timeshift knowing that it was only 5 bucks to purchase and wait for steam to support a patch or buy it from another vendor. No the manual patching you can do off the web does not work and multiplayer has been down for years.
1062	0	a	Even at some early points, surprisingly hard and frustrating. The opponents are close to invisible and invincible. You have to pump a whole clip of ammo to a single opponent when there are some 25-30 of them and you can slow time only for a couple of seconds. And it's a really old title, c'mon, 15Euros? When it's on sale with a 75% save, maybe. If you dont get annoyed too easy... Or if you plan to play on easy level (and dont get annoyed too easy...). But definitely not for 15 Euros.
1063	0	a	Huge performance issues and bugs. Did not want to start at first, afterwards I had giant lack spikes all the time. Reading the discussions, this has something to do with Windows 7 being not supported or what not.
1064	0	a	Worth getting on sale as the 'time shift' game mechanic is pretty cool, however the game is showing it's age both in design/gameplay and bugginess. Somewhat remenicant of Half-Life with time/physics puzzles, but they get old fast. Entertaining for a while, maybe I'll come back and finish it some time, maybe not.  5/10 novel game mechanic, but poor in most other areas (partly due to it's age)
1065	0	a	Doesn't run. After selecting new game, it brings up a pause screen and hangs
1066	0	a	Not even worth $3.74
1067	0	a	does not work on some intel processors and windows 7 pro 64 bit
1068	0	a	I wish I could use my powers to Timeshift back to before I bought this game.  It's a fun, creative game but no matter what drivers I install, my game faces random crashing, it's odd because I can play the game just fine but loading my save causes it to crash every time now.  If I had a work-around for this, it'd be a much better experience all around.
1069	0	a	I havenÂ´t finished this game yet. But IÂ´m ready to come to the conclusion that IÂ´d not recommend this game to anyone. ItÂ´s so basic and repetitive, and the art is quite mediocre too. ItÂ´s not really bad in any particular area, but it just doesnÂ´t have appeal. Maybe if the time manipulation was innovative, but at this point almost all games that tried it too have done it better. 5.5/10
1070	0	a	A medicore game, at best. Good concept and visuals, but poor gameplay, mainly due to gimmicky powers, bullet sponge enemies and a boring last half. Only really good when you get it on sale and have a weekend spare
1071	0	a	Anyone having problem with TimeShift at the startup as:  Incompatible Video Driver (17.10.1315) TimeShift will not run optimally and may crash or freeze without the proper video drivers. It was detected that your drivers need to be updated. Please download and install proper video card drivers.  Here's what i have on my machie: Intel Extreme I-7 4930-k 6 cores at 3.4 Ghz multi-threaded Asus Sabertooth X79 16 GB of ram Kingston Fury at 1633 Mhz AMD Radeon HD 7850 PCS+ OC edition. And my Video card is now up-to-date as this game told me my driver wasn't up-to-date and i did it and still giving me that window box before the launch.  So anyone as any news from Sierra Entertainment or Activision?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TimeShift 
1072	0	a	Corridor Shooter and the Time Mechanic get's old quick.
1073	0	a	It's painful to play this game. Stiff controls, bad cinematics, not responsive-lauzy gameplay. Most of the game copied from Half Life and in a bad way.
1074	0	a	Doesn't do so well as a shooter. And time manipulation didn't make it better for me. Id' rate it 'meh'. If it's some 75% off go ahead and buy it you might even like it.
1075	0	a	This is horrible. I normally finish my games, but this is just the worst. Leaving the storyless narrative aside, the gameplay itself is very lackluster. There's no way to turn off mouse acceleration. The weapons are super generic, and worst yet, you feel like a you're wearing a crappy aluminum can instead of some high-tech body armor.   If you're expecting something like Crysis Power Suit + F.E.A.R. time manipulation, you'll be disappointed. Not only are you super fragile (die from a few bullets), your timeshifting abilities can only slow down time for a few seconds, or pause it for even less time. This is just the worst.  I normally finish games, but this is unbearably a waste of time.  Rating: 0/10.
1076	0	a	Very disappoint after seeing all the praise the game gets for being underrated. Pitiful story, worse gunplay, and gimmicky timeshift mechanics.  First of all, there is no sprint, which wouldn't be a problem but the main character casually walks in the most life threatening situations. You can often die trying to walk to cover when your time powers run out. It tried to make you think about where you should be as you run out of powers but it's more like putting anvils on your shoes and calling it a design choice.  The time powers were also a very big disappoint. Neat concepts but the execution was very poor. The time rewind and time stop use so much power it seems they were only put in to solve the extremely simple time 'puzzles'; such as walking over the millions of electrified puddles. Time slow is about 90% of power usage as it's the only power that gives you any real chance in combat vs more than one soldier.  Now the gunplay isn't the worse I've seen in a game, but the way enemies can soak up about half of a magazine til death makes even the best FPSer turn into a camper while his OP slow time power comes back. I was never a fan of the bullet sponge enemies because it makes combat more gimmicky and campy. Even if you are quicker than the enemy it doesn't matter when you have to go through half a mag to kill one enemy while 2 others are shooting. Combat tends to be either slaughter everyone while in time slow mode then camp to wait for power to come back, or spam grenades for one hit kills then pick up more from their bodies. The only time combat felt somewhat fair outside of time slow was either the ballistic crossbow or sniping headshots, and even then enemies all had pinpoint accuracy from a mile away; and mouse sensitivity is iffy and ignores small movements when zoomed in too far in scope.  The game also doesn't understand what pacing or transitions are. The weapons go from the weakest assault rifle ever made, to the most overpowered weapons. The game goes from frustrating to super easy mode with the one shot crossbow, or infinite ammo boxes with a sniper or rocket launcher next to them. It still ends up being time slow then murder everyone; it just gets easier being able to one shot everyone before they murder you with pinpoint accuracy from a mile away when your time slow runs our and you are out of cover.   I mean, for an old game it isn't as bad as what I've seen, but it definitely doesn't deserve all the praise when it really is just semi-unique and but a very gimmicky one trick pony
1077	0	a	Maybe it was a good game about 10 years ago. Not so special today. Run and shoot game with some special abilities. Hardly any story.
1078	0	a	Doesn't hold up well over time and the gameplay feels oddly slower than it should. The ability to control time is so over done by this point that it feels cheap. Get it on sale with the understanding that it's nothing to write home about.
1079	0	a	Under-rated for a reason!
1080	0	a	Not enjoyable. It takes around two mags to kill someone. Two hours into the game I started wondering if any of my abilities would get better (damage increase, better guns, time altering length extensions, armor). When slowing, stopping and rewinding time, it feels like the meter bar, for the amount of altering time you have left, drains way too fast to the point of why is this feature even in the game. Every time I went to a box that has the blue lasers covering the weapon in it, I thought I would get a better gun, but it would always just be more ammo. You'll have to worry about ammo either, it's everywhere. I didn't even know why I was fighting in the story, (Might just be my own problem) they just didn't make it interesting enough to want to know what's going on.
1081	0	a	Very average shooter, but with some interesting mechanics. Sadly the time-shifting abilities are only used to solve puzzles or as a 'bullet time' to pick off enemies, I really hoped they would have designed the game better around them. Taking them away leaves you with a bland shooter, nothing to write home about and a completely forgettable storyline, plus boring environments and level design. Not recommended, I'd give it maybe a 6/10 cause I still somewhat had fun and the weapons are quite cool. Nice gore effects also.
1082	0	a	**WARNING**  There is no multiplayer for this game. Gamespy killed it just like so many other games. I was not even able to create a listen server locally to host a server for directy connect. This game for all intents and purposes is single player only.
1083	0	a	A slow and derivative slog. Your health comes back so quickly that you never feel like you're in danger. However, enemies soak up a half-dozen shots to the chest before dying, so you don't feel powerful either. Killing them doesn't feel like victory, it feels like a chore. The time powers are uninspired and not particularly useful.  And it's ripping off Half-Life 2 in a way that just feels pathetic. You fight battle-robots alongside The Rebels in a bombed out European city while the Evil Scientist President harangues you from a giant tv screen. You even run down a canal while baddies shoot at you from up on the walls!  Don't waste your time on this.  
1084	0	a	Abominably bad, one of my biggest gaming disppointments. Do not buy.  EDIT: Finally struggled through to the endgame. A few thoughts:   - Story blatantly rips off Half Life 2, while somehow missing the pacing and depth that were the worthy parts to steal.  - Gameplay can flow nicely, but quickly becomes repetitive.  - Terrible level design.  - Graphics make Deus Ex's look modern.  - Pathetic AI.  - All the characters are 1-dimensional.  There is no challenge in this game. The time control mechanics make regular combat insultingly easy, even against the enhanced enemies. By the end I was just breezing through the fights. Ideally the story would have compensated for the boredom, but no luck there. The endgame was a cutscene, no payoff, no interaction. Just headshot, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ity bye. Overall, a wasted opportunity.
1085	0	a	cant even run for 5 mins without crashing its time they made a remake of this title that works on todays pc's instead of remaking remakes of games that arnt even 5 years old spend some time in the real clasics in stead  
1086	0	a	interesting story, but mediocre gameplay
1087	0	a	 Edit: I finished the game, to check if that review was made too hastly. It is not; I stand by my point: this game sucks, and I am pretty sure that the reason why bad reviews are systematically poorly noted is that there are people who's interest is to sel... erm, downvote bad reviews of that game. DO NOT BUY. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME.   I expect this review to be poorly noted (around 0%, maybe a bit more if I'm lucky to be read by someone honest), just like ANY other bad review on this game (I won't write here what are my takes on 'why', I let the reader figure out by himself why ALL the bad reviews on this game are poorly noted, whatever they may contain).  This game is not a pretty game. It's from 2007 but looks like it was from the early 2000 (LOTS of bump mapping, low-def textures, bad animations, very low poly models, etc. - I'm, of course, running the game on 'best' settings for everything; and honestly, as pointed out by one of my contacts, it's not due to the engine, which is pretty solid for the epoch, but rather to the lack of artistical direction, and very poor graphical choices). This game isn't a fun game either: the gameplay is utterly repetitive, the immersion is inexistent, there is no challenge either, and the time-based mechanics are interesting for a few minutes at best.  The player is left without any instruction, without any guidance on how to use the controls, without any background story, without anything that can help immerison, or interest: to imagine what playing this game is, just imagine downloading a random indie FPS with funny, unusual controls, with a random map, and stupid A.I., and you'll get close to what that game is.  I haven't played enough to give more insight about that crap, but I surely regret having spent 5 bucks into that. There are PLENTY of better games to buy, from Singularity (that also features some time-control mechanics) to Hard Reboot, and so on. Don't waste your time (especially) or money on that one, not worth it by any extent.
1088	0	a	So far I honestly regrett having bought this game. It's just unnatural. Starts with the default key bindings which are far off from what the average FPS is using: Zooming in is done with 'e', a melee attack by clicking the mouse wheel, the powers use awkward keys. There is no sprint, you get slightly faster additionally when slowing down time, but energy recovery is far too slow. On 'Skilled', it takes up to three shots with a shotgun to the head if they enemy's wearing a helmet. I fire away an entire mag with the assault rifle to the body. Luckily you get a lot of ammo, however you still heavily depend on using your time shifting abilities. But as said, the energy recovers way too slowly for such a heavy use.  You don't get any information on who you are are what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ even happened. You suddenly appear in 1939 of an alternative world where a high tech civil uprising takes place instead of WWII. It's just your standard, linear, straight-forward FPS with special abilities in which difficulty doesn't mean a more human-like AI, but rougher enemies with increased health and armor and more bullets for you to take. As always, you're the uber-soldier, although I had the impression that actually you're a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing scientist... since when can I, as a scientist, remorselessly kill people and even fire a damn gun so precisely?!  'Soldier, WHO ARE you?' &lt;--- I DON'T â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING KNOW.
1089	0	a	I wish I could TimeSHift to before owning this game.
1090	0	a	Game requires certain drivers, and the ones they tell you to download aren't availbable. I'm sad I bought this...
1091	0	a	The game has game-breaking bug in time manipulation mechanics: no matter how hard I tried I couldn't timeshift back before purchase and did not purchase it.
1092	0	a	Random deaths suck
1093	0	a	This game has no multiplayer so your better off just pirating it.
1094	0	a	The game leaves me wishing I had the TimeShiftâ„¢ abilities in real life so I could go back in time to the point where I bought the game and correct my decision.
1095	0	a	Overrated. I expected much more from this game. No story, no collectables, no weapon upgrades. Just going from A to B and shooting. Time freeze is the only thing that makes this game different from any other mediocre FPS.
1096	0	a	boring and tedious half-life 2 ripoff
1097	0	a	The game doesnt work on newer systems and doesnt work with windows 7 64 bit OS
1098	0	a	Tried on my 2010 gaming laptop and 2015 gaming pc and it doesn't work. No solutions found
1099	0	a	horrible P.O.S. dont buy it
1100	0	a	bad bioshock clone
1101	0	a	Whilst this game had some fun moments I can't really recommend it unless you manage to get it on sale, like I did (3,75 euro).  Basically, Timeshift is a mixture of F.E.A.R. and Half-Life, yet completely lacking in atmosphere and devoid of any interesting characters.  The 'story', for want of a better word, is pathetic, and turns out to be merely a weak pretext for moving you along from one set of stuff that you have to blow the s##t out of to another.  The widely dispersed 10 second long cut scenes containg anonymous characters that you don't give a fÃ¹@k about are laughably bad.  Some of the puzzles would be fun ... if you didn't have to die 10 times in order to solve them, which for me is a total immersion breaker ... although perhaps the word 'immersion' is paying to high a compliment to this drivel.  Summary: Not worth it unless you're in desperate need of some mental chewing gum to get you through a rainy day.
1102	0	a	I really wanted to like this game however I cannot recommend for one simple reason, bad story. The gameplay is solid despite the dated graphics. Also it is a fun shooter. However the end is an extreme let down to me and overall the story is just terrible. I found I didn't care about any of the characters and no one felt real.  In all if you want a fun shooter but don't care about story this game is worth your time, but that is it. If you end up liking this game I highly recommend checking Singularity, its at least as fun and the story is surprising how good it is as well as the way it is told.
1103	0	a	good game on AMD FX 8350K 8 CORE CPU with MSI RX 470 G - CARDS WORKS ON WINDOWS 10  its a great game but you won't work onlone on multplayer i say if you want to play this game get a ps3 or xbox 360.
1104	0	a	Mediocre shooter with porting and technological issues.  The gameplay idea and mechanic is pretty interesting; you control time; slow it down, stop it, or even reverse it. However, that does not make the game fun.  The presentation is pretty good at places, but the shooting is very generic, unprecise (big crosshair where shots seemed off of the central point), and unrewarding. Graphics are pretty mediocre. Levels are very linear, with the occasional wait for trigger or wait for NPC scene.  As for the technological side of things: The key bindings are totally off - a bad port from consoles. The game first launched on my smaller, second monitor. I had to fiddle with ini configuration files to increase resolution and make it automatically decide to use the other monitor (good luck if you have multiple monitors with the same resolution). Especially in the tutorial, I noticed *big* hung-ups when I entered new areas, even rooms, where it probably loaded some data. A bit later, you occasionally slow down, simply walking a lot slower, which probably hides the loadung unresponsiveness. Hung-ups are definitely not something you like to see on a powerful PC. When launching, it tells me my drivers are not supported, twice, and links me to a dead website.  All in all, I had no fun at all in the little I played (I did press through the tutorial to see if the game itself, with the time manipulation aspect was any fun, but it was not), and with the technological issues, Iâ€™m thinking about refunding the game - because I certainly wonâ€™t play it any more. Definitely no recommendation.
1105	0	a	This game, on boy do I have a love hate relationship with this game.  It was the first 7th gen FPS I've played, and it taught me alot about shooters thanks to its solid gameplay and great time control mechanic that really works, but aside its nostagic values. This is not a good game, its decent at best.    It has alot of problem; boring unclear story, generic shooting, awful vehicle control and one of the worst multiplayer mode I've ever played. Else than its time mechanic, this game offers very little to the table, even back in 2007.
1106	0	a	Rather than adopting the typical structured format for my review, I'll instead just explain why I can't recommend this game. First off, this game has consolitis. Hard. Maximum resolution is 1280x800, it can't be run in a window without 'unexpected results,' and it ended up crashing my computer while attempting to play it. Twice. I think I will end up getting it on console, but I just can't recommend it for Steam. Apparently Prototype 2 is a worse port, which completely blows my mind. Anyways, this port just isn't worth it. It's buggy, locked down to hell, and is actually more expensive than just getting it for the 360 or PS3 off of eBay.
1107	0	a	I want to like the game, but with the sound issues, and all the work arounds, and there never been a patch, I just can't honestly recomend the game on Steam.  Is fun, no doubt, and the story is pretty interesting. The mechanics are awesome, the skills are really cool to use, etc etc etc, but the sound, and only being able to play for about an hour at a time without having issues happen, or going in and deleting files to remove sound issues, whatever. Is just ... not really worth it.
1108	0	a	I'm mildly upset; I've owned a copy of this wonderful game on a console before, and it was just fine. Great, even, I've had a fantastic experience. It has pretty good gameplay, not much in the way of story, but enough fun to leave a nice impression on you.   The reason I'm leaving a negative review is because the PC port is horribly broken right off the bat. It's the sound. The god-awful sound. it feels like it's been revved up to x64 speed. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the port.
1109	0	a	Great game. Terrible port. Don't waste your money.
1110	0	a	TL,DR: Great idea, terrible implementation.  There is nothing that disappoints me more than lost potential. When I heard about this game, I loved the premise. Be an evil god! Leaping through the city, unleasing your unspeakable power on the hapless citizens! And sometimes, that's what I got. Most times however, what I got was a buggy, lazy, difficult-to-control mess.  I have some ideas what happened here. 1) The open world's so big, and there's so many missions and events and kaka, the designers didn't put all the effort they should have into polishing and playtesting. I can't help but contrast this game against something like Portal, that's small but perfectly tuned. I didn't expect THAT from Prototype, but I would have happily swapped a few missions and events for more time taken working the bugs out of the others. 2) From what I've read of other people's complaints, this is a really lazy port. The fact alone that this started as a console game explains some of my frustration, as there are simply too many options mapped to too few keys, leading to frequent raging when I meant to do one thing and something else happened.  I did finish the game. I finished nearly all of the events. And I'm not just calling a game bad because I sucked at it. In events where I actually felt like I was fighting NPCs instead of gameplay and glitches, I did fine. I got gold in most events, some on the first try. My frustration wasn't from lack of skill, but from things like...  *There are kill missions where you are supposed to use a certain weapon or power. Half the challenge is keeping the game from defaulting to kicking and jumping attacks that won't count towards your score. *Sometimes no matter how much I selected the whipfist, I wouldn't transform into it. No other power had this problem (Until the final boss, where I kept getting locked into previous powers and being unable to change them for a minute or so). *I beat an event with four seconds clearly left on the clock and it said I'd failed it. *Watching my character destroy infected water towers, yet the game says they hatched before I did. *Game gives you incorrect advice on how to proceed with a helicopter mission: 'Hold TAB and flick mouse to select another detector' *I lost track of the number of times NPCs killed off a Web Of Intrigue target before I could get to them. I lost an event MULTIPLE TIMES because of this. *A Consume Event icon on my map; no event or marker in the area when I'm directly at the spot. Followed by a Consume Event marker floating in midair with no corresponding event. *I consume a target in an event, the game says the target died and doesn't count it. I was IN the animation of consuming it! *Accidentally hit escape during an event; this aborts the event instead of pausing the game. *Targeting is gambling. Most of the time my attacks would hit just fine, but sometimes the game would decide that I'd much rather punch a helicopter than the Hunter I targeted. *Sound was really low, even at the highest volume. *Was supposed to protect a tank. Control was taken away from me while the game played a cutscene. During this cutscene, hunters attacked the tank and crippled it. I had absolutely no way to stop them. *Boss battle against a Supreme Hunter. Suddenly 'Objective Completed' without me having done anything, leaving me feeling cheated of a good fight. *I had to kill 100 enemies for an event. At 99 kills, the game stopped producing NPCs so I lost the event. *Timed kill event located in an area with tons of low fences, preventing me from getting to enemies or enemies getting to me. *Frequently getting stuck inside tanks despite clicking 'E' tons of times. *Lost a Movement event twice because the game suddenly put me in my armor, which meant I dropped out of parkour and lost precious seconds trying to get the armor off.  And you know what? I could forgive all of that, but the final straw was how TWO CUTSCENES THAT OCCUR DURING MISSIONS WILL CRASH THE GAME, MEANING YOU WILL HAVE TO START THOSE MISSIONS ALL OVER AGAIN AFTER YOU RESTART. The cutscene plays; fade to black; game is completely frozen. And it wasn't just me: I saw many, many people on many different websites describing the crash in The Stolen Body and Men Like Gods. Supposedly it's a corrupted audio file. It's unforgivable that this hasn't been patched by now.  So yeah, there were moments of occasional triumph. I liked a lot of the powers, the whipfist especially. when the game worked, it actually did feel pretty damn great. But those moments were rare. This was a game where 'flow' should have happened way, WAY more than it ever did. I got this for five bucks during a Steam sale and feel ripped off.  Also, I'm gonna be hearing those bedamned military alarm sirens in my sleep for weeks.

1112	0	a	In Prototype you play as a man named Alex fighting against a shadowy government entity that heâ€™s very mad at for giving him godlike superpowers. I would try to explain the plot further, but I honestly canâ€™t. The volume drops inexplicity to whispers in all of the gameâ€™s cutscenes - itâ€™s as if the voice actors themselves are embarrassed at taking part in this travesty.  Youâ€™ll battle the government and the plague monsters infecting an island that looks as if someone attempted to draw Manhattan without ever having been there - or even Googled it to see what it looks like. Fortunately, youâ€™ll have a lot of cool powers at your disposal to help you. Unfortunately, thanks to Prototypeâ€™s overly complicated control system, you wonâ€™t figure how out how to use half of them. It doesnâ€™t help that, despite Alexâ€™s ability to hijack a helicopter in midair and bodyslam a tank, he canâ€™t properly block. This becomes a problem as the creators of this game think that the way to make Prototypeâ€™s later missions be more challenging is for them to simply throw thousands of enemies at your face. The longer the game goes the more frustrating it becomes.  Ultimately, Prototype can be a fun way to spend a few hours, but youâ€™ll quickly question why you keep playing it.
1113	0	a	At launch you already needed third party fixes to make game playable, now few years later they still haven't fixed it, talk about lazy developers, so disrespectfull, you pay them money and don't even bother to fix the game even after so many years, don't buy without doing research on issues to make sure you can fix them on your own, if you cannot fix it on your own then don't bother at all.
1114	0	a	I used to play this so much on the Xbox back in the day. When I loaded it up on the PC, it sounded like Alvin and the Chimpumunks were having an orgy. For those who own a Windows 10 and want to buy this game, just don't.
1115	0	a	Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of whatâ€™s happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people whoâ€™ve done that to you and make them pay. The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body â€œat willâ€ to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say â€œat willâ€ I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can â€˜consumeâ€™ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.   Iâ€™d say the graphics are dated, but itâ€™s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesnâ€™t get a pass for, however, is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassinâ€™s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no â€œlowâ€ video settings, hey). Iâ€™m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.   Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as itâ€™s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.  The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.   Itâ€™s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If youâ€™re extremely bored and want to play something that doesnâ€™t pose a huge challenge, itâ€™s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.  I wouldnâ€™t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.

1118	0	a	It's buggy and hardware intensive...even if you buy a new video card to appease it's high standards, you get through 80% of the game just to get a black screen and no way to progress.
1119	0	a	Doesn't work without a ton of changes, 8 fps and limited resolutions available. Not a good port
1120	0	a	I wold like to start off by saying I love this studio, I love this game ploline, I love games like this in general. but I dont honestly know how you let these controls get past testing. like was it your goal to release a game that pisses people off because you tell your character to go one direction and he takes a running leap 2 dashes and glides in the opposite direction. this sincerely does not deserve to be available for purchase. please correct your issues with your equations for locking onto a wall and directional aiming when jumping. a fix for something like this wouldnt take more than a week for one lone programmer please take the time ou of your oh so very busy schedule and fix the first game in your series.
1121	0	a	couldnt get it to load kept crashing a shame it looked fun
1122	0	a	Prototype looks like a really fun game, but the PC port is god awful.  You need to disable HID devices for the game to even run and even then it might not even work  The game crashes, freezes and pretty much anyone who owns the PC port seems to have problems.    Seriously, If your interested in this game, go for the console version
1123	0	a	Broken on modern tech. Used to play fine on last rig and now just constant crashing and all searching leads to dead ends for fixes. Avoid if playing on anything win 8 and up.
1124	0	a	I honestly believe Radical Entertainment though up this game, went around to other developer studios learning what they did wrong and right in games in the past, took the 'right' pile, tossed it in the toilet and flushed it down, and started building the 'wrong' pile into some unholy altar.  Seriously. EVERY... SINGLE... THING... in this game is a TEXTBOOK example of 'what NOT to do in video games' that you'd get in a 101 class.  Terrible controls. Terrible plot. Terrible music- maybe. Sound was INSANELY LOW compared to everything else on my computer- even when maxed. I literally had to TRIPLE the volume of my speakers to be able to hear it at a decent level. Terrible graphics. Terrible controls. Oh wait- I said that already. Well it's important to re-emphasize because the controls and mechanics made the game BORDERLINE unplayable. And I use that world with the utmost intention. If it had a SINGLE thing worse with it's controls- it would have been straight up unplayable. The game until a certain point was so easy it was impossible to enjoy. Then after that point they cranked the meter up to 11 to the point it was entirely unfair. Permanent stunlocks. ONE HIT KOs that you CANNOT avoid.  NEVER. EVER. EEEEEVER... buy this game. EVER.  I got this game at 75% off on a sale. I feel like walking up to the developers studio and demanding that 25% I paid back as a refund, then the 75% I didn't added on to compensate for my pain and suffering. This game was THAT bad. I've only ever quit one other game in my entire LIFE- witcher 2. And that was because it was LITERALLY unplayable due to issues with the port to PC. At least I knew within the first 3 minutes of witcher 2 that it was going to be nothing but pain and suffering and I didn't actually suffer through the ENTIRE thing.  I played through the game start to finish (as quickly as humanly possible...) so no one can say I didn't give it a chance. It had it's chance 100 times over as far as I'm concerned. I am unfortunate enough to have bought prototype 2 at the same time as part of the franchise pack when the game was on sale. Needless to say- I will not be installing that any time soon.
1125	0	a	First thing first, I had absolutely lots of fun with this game. Just the sheer amount of destruction you are capable of doing is incredible. The hero has so grossly overpowered he literally rips to shreds everything he encounters, from regular people, through tanks and helicopter to disgusting and huge mutants. Action is satisfying and story, B-rated as it is, has a nice twist at the end. The reason I must say no, is that the game has some technical difficulties and it took me a few hours browsing through internet discussion and trying a lot of things to get it run normally on more than 3 FPS.
1126	0	a	Rubbish Game engine  need tune my sound card quality to 24bit 48khz! WTF
1127	0	a	i must admit while i do like this game get it on sale for atleast 70 off it gets really annoying note this is not a bad game just not worth what else you could get like saints row or this war of mine 
1128	0	a	this game is overall fun but the turtorials i had to search on google many times to understand what the hell they meant and they still didnt work. You lose your powers at some point and that gets really boring to play so i stopped when the quest for getting your powers back never ended.
1129	0	a	Worst optimization I have ever seen.
1130	0	a	Prototype is actually a really fun game, but its an example of one of the negatives of PC gaming that I've dealt with over the decades I've been nerding out... some games just stop working on modern hardware. This can be for a variety of reasons, and some people can fix the problems with a weird trick like disabling some obscure setting in your OS that you've never heard of... but for some people, myself included, the reasons are completely mysterious.  Prototype barely worked for me, and I eventually just sort of gave up on it. The common fixes posted online don't seem to work for me, so I'm kind of left in the dust.  If the game runs for you, you'll have a blast, but I can't recommend it based on how it performs. The developers also seem uninterested in fixing the issues as of April 2016.
1131	0	a	Wont start from first save. Modern Machine. 
1132	0	a	if I press the mouse the whole game just closes
1133	0	a	An over-hyped game, with nothing exceptionally special going for it. The gameplay is repetitive and quite bland. The game feels like it drags on and was more of a chore to complete, rather than a pleasure
1134	0	a	Doesn't natively run at 1440P. Crashes on startup after getting the fix for that.
1135	0	a	 ...MmmMy Name Is Alex... Mercer... an  angry-as-f__k  pile of bioplasm in the guise of a man.    I was interested in this game when it was new because ot the amazing opening sequence done by Blur (I am an un-repentant fan of their work) but was ultimately swayed toward the PS3-exclusive Infamous. Having played that game I've decided to give Prototype a shot.  The name couldn't be more apt. Unfortunately for me, having something to compare this game to has compromised a good chunk of my objectivity.  I like the open world aspect, and the visceral feeling of power that Alex has, but I could do without his one-note, 'I'm angry, with a gravely voice', presentation   I don't like that his only interactions with the npcs range from  NYC-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  to  homicidal sociopath .  The game performamce is a little laggy but otherwise problem free, (I am playing on a laptop with middling AMD graphics, as my gaming rig is in storage until get a new place) and it holds up pretty well at 720p The issue I have is with how long it take to switch to and from the... 'genetic memories'(?) Section.  I am not through with game but right it's grade is a c+  Addendum: I am finally at the end this... game and my enjoyment has dwindled as I have gone on... I am at what is I'm guessing is the final boss (after starting the game over on a new machine) and I am struggling to find any reason to continue. Poor AI and targeting has just gotten worse (or more noticeable) as the game went on.  Final grade of this game is a   D -  
1136	0	a	Isn't as good as the sequel. It's a much longer learning curve and not as fun (obviously it's older but that doesn't change my mind).
1137	0	a	This may be a good game in the original, but this port is horrible. The only way anyone could fully understand what's going if playing for the first time would be to turn on subtitles. Most things are fine but audio issues alone ruin this. Most of all, you Activision will be too lazy to go back and fix this 'small' issue. If you want to play this game, I suggest you find a console version instead. I once again must ephasize it's not the game that's bad, it's just this port of it.
1138	0	a	It is very boring.  There are some 'fireworks' in the game, but these days a game must be like a good movie to be atractive. There are so many other games with a good story in the background. Here you just walk, run or fly and destroy everything around you.  Waste of time... Really...
1139	0	a	no wonder its a prototype, everytime I play it is all high pitched and laggy, sounds like the nintendo version of it!
1140	0	a	i hate it becuse the timer on the roof gives u 4 secs and im stuck :( 
1141	0	a	Huge buyer's remorse. I have a pretty nice rig and this game runs at maybe 10 fps. Poorly optimized port, save your money.

1143	0	a	DONT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET SCREWED!!!!!!  First off, these games have ENORMOUS FPS issues. I managed to fix them for the first installment, but I shouldnt have to(it should have a patch!!!!)  Secondly, I cannot get Prototype 2 to work. Where it used to crash within 2 seconds of executing the application, I got past that and now its THE MOST INTENSE FPS ISSUE IVE EVER FACED.......Activision, you blow, suck, squeeze, bang, and blew your load in our mouths for the prices you charge for these installments that DONT work. If you are going to port a game over to PC....Atleast have the decency to patch problems that come along with it. DONT START A PROJECT AND NOT FINISH IT!!!!!

1146	0	a	Well, the gameplay itself is like a newer Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. That's great and all, but I ran into a terrible bug with the sound. All the sound effects and music are sped up when you're in the levels, and it's horrible, squeaky, and it's impossible to tolerate. If there's ever a patch, I'll re-install this game in a heartbeat.
1147	0	a	So, i tried playing this game on my Windows 7 PC. It is pretty much as good as those with Windows 7 go, but the game is stuck on constant 5 fps, making it barely playable. Apparently it is connected to HID, which would be fine. IF this was the year 2009. Seven years later, this gamebreaking error is not fixed, and has to be manually looked up and dealt with by players who want to play this. To people who want to play a singleplayer game for once because their internet is too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to play online, this is just infuriating. So basically, i bet i would like this game, if i could play it. But due to this error, i wont be able to, and seeing as this is left unfixed for seven years now, there is no hope for me to play this game in the future either.
1148	0	a	Really good for the first two thirds, except for a couple of difficulty spikes, but the last third of the game is awful. These developers had no idea how to do difficulty right.

1155	0	a	I wanted to play this game, but it runs like utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. You telling me I can max Arma 3 at 60fps 1080p, but I can't run a game from 2009 on the lowest setting and resolution at above 10fps?
1156	0	a	Didn't age well, graphics are choppy as hell, even the cut scenes. And no my computer is not crap, its very good.
1157	0	a	I had high hopes, way back when I bought this. A superhero game with body horror? Awesome! But no, while running and gliding aroud was fun and growing giant claws and was even more fun, a dull story, entirely unsympathetic cipher of a protagonist and samey, dull, dull combat dragged it down.  That said, it was fun to absorb soldiers and take their appearance then point at someone else and watch people shoot them.
1158	0	a	Wow, this game is horrible, controls are crappy, graphics are hiedous amd sounds like an 80s game. Very dissapointed!
1159	0	a	This game blows. Don't buy it.
1160	0	a	There's only a couple conditions under which you should buy this game: One being you are out of other games to play entirely, two you don't really care about story or content but enjoy rampaging, three it is on sale. Unless you have all three of those conditions, it's probably not worth your time or money. This game is a mashup of GTA and Infamous, but not nearly being as good as either. The story, voice acting, gameplay mechanics, and AI intelligence are all shoddy, so really you play this game through until you unlock all of your powers and then just rampage killing everyone for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and giggles. Even then that can be boring because there's no variety in any enemies, situations, or scenery in the game. All in all, this is a game that you will want to play casually, and not something you're probably going to enjoy an overly large amount.
1161	0	a	This game is awesome, however, the game file is broken or just DERP for no reason. it has trouble opening, and sometimes doesnt but now it just crapped out while in game. i am really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off at steam for selling me a $20 game, that i can barely play. i would not buy this product until its playable. i have a win 8, Asus with 16 G ram and a 630 Nvidia G-Force, and a dual quad proccessor. my computer is fine, ive redownloaded the game, deleted the cache, gone through troubleshooting and forums. even went through the firewall, anti-virus and even uninstalled steam, reinstalled, reinstalled the game and still i get a failed to find Exacutable file. WTF Steam.
1162	0	a	Not recommended. I keep getting fooled by EA games. It's a fun premise, with lots of other people giving it great reviews.  Some obvious short comings is resolution is capped at 720p, and cut scene audio isn't ported out correctly (you can change the latency in which audio comes in, which means unsynced audio/audio plays faster than the video in cut scenes). It's pretty bad, even for a 5 year old game - EA always does ports, and they've always turned out unpolished.   Maximum AA is 2x, and in all honesty, the graphics are horrendous for a 2009 game. This looks like it was based on the first generation half life engine.   All in all tho, the story has potential, as well as the game play (game play/controls/movement is not fluid), and the beginning tutorial is kind of useless as... you have to redo another tutorial anyways. The biggest appeal to me, is like all the other reviewers said - you are an over powered beast capable of rampaging through everywhere. The terrible port of cutscenes detracts from the otherwise good story line, and the controls are pretty bad (eg: i'm standing over a gun, I press the 'grab' button, and he lunges in the air hoping to grapple a non-existent target instead of the gun he's standing on top of. Problem is, his lunge moves him forward, meaning i have to reposition him per failed grab. Ugh)  I don't recommend this EA port of a game, at all. Frustrating, perhaps console version is better
1163	0	a	You have to be 10 for this one.
1164	0	a	Eww  7/10 game 3/10 optimization. GET IT FOR CONSOLE YA PEASANTS
1165	0	a	The combats are bad but the storyline seems nice.
1166	0	a	Wont start from first save. Modern Machine. 
1167	0	a	An interesting freeroam game, with a good idea and interesting story. Those who like free roam games will like it. Overall it's good. But the story is full of clichÃ©s, the combat system is too console like, and resembles the Force Unleashed (I just beat before this game). The same targeting, health gain system and even you have unlockables, and upgrades (not really combos). The NPC characters start to look the same after a while. I was somwhere in the middle of the story or at the first third, when I totally lost my interest. Nor the story, neither the game style couldn't get me back to the game.
1168	0	a	Mouse inputs didn't work. Kind of hard to like a game I can't play.
1169	0	a	Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.

I honestly have no idea why people say this one is better than Prototype 2... its not better is worse by double and I do not recommend buying this game, however you should go and buy Prototype 2.
1176	0	a	Wont run in 1080p because I have 'To much' vram. And now crashes everytime I load gameplay. Terrible unsupported port, and a waste of money.
1177	0	a	Will lag like crazy unless you disable HID compatible devices in device manager.   Bug hasn't been fixed after 5 years.
1178	0	a	This game is a prime example of what happens when people that think game consoles were a good idea try to develop video games. Apart from the usual UI horrors (lengthy, yet unskippable 'presented by' sequence at every start, 'do not turn off power while the game is saving' notice at every start, extremely inaccurate mouse tracking, etc.), the aspect ratio is messed up (huge black borders; I've seen others complain about this on the forums, so it seems it isn't just me), the controls are clearly geared towards  (gag)  gamepads and the list goes on with all the classic nonsense that happens when a game is developed for consoles and then back-ported to PC.  What really tipped the balance is the fact that the performance is completely ruined by what, judging from what I read on the forums, is likely some severe issue with detecting the controls. After having spent days getting Final Fantasy XIII (which exhibits a similar issue) to run halfway decently, I frankly can't be  &lt;kinsoku jikou&gt; ed to find a series of hacks just to circumvent this ridiculous performance hit. Even on a state-of-the-art PC that runs all other (properly developed!) games smoothly on high quality settings, this game can only be described as 'unplayable' on PC. While there might or might not be ways to fix this up (apparently involving downloading hacked versions of game DLLs from shady one click hoster sites --  DO NOT DO THIS , you'll be inviting viruses, trojans and whatnot onto your system!), it can only be said that the average Joe (as in, somebody that isn't a computer expert) would have little chance to get this game to work properly (without blindly following quite dangerous instructions off the internet, anyway, cf. the bit about the modified DLLs).  On a more technical note, apparently there is a cap on the amount of video memory and exceeding this cap restricts the quality settings severly. The very fact that this cap is 2 GB rather than 4 GB (i.e. the so-called engine uses a signed integer to represent memory size) is quite indicative of whoever wrote this game not knowing anywhere near enough about programming to even think about making video games. I'm sorry, and this is not supposed to be flame bait, nor an insult, nor to be taken personally, but the preceding is simply a fact.   Bottom line : Unplayable on PC; cannot, in good conscience, recommend.
1179	0	a	The Unreal Engine 3 is pretty standard fare but it's definitely not been fully utilized. Will add more later. It's worse than Prototype 2 but that's a given. At least some parts are more realistic. E.g. The viral detectors are far more sensitive in this version.  PROS 1. Good story I like how it goes. I'm quite curious as to how the story ends.  CONS 1. Movements are clunky a. You can only run upwards on the walls, not sideways b. If you run upwards into the rafters, you flip backwards  2. AI is dumb If you land from a 50-storey building in a black ops disguise, no one seems to be suspicious.  3. Combat is horrendous You can't fix onto a single target enemy and you swing all over the place. Swinging would be good if your reach was far enough but it's so pathetic. You tend to punch instead of using your claws as well.  4. Combat is lame Collecting genetic materials was so lame. You are basically running around a zone collecting shiny bubbles. You are a living weapon not a bubble collector.  5. Flashbacks It's basically cheap voice acting. The images are re-used over and over again.
1180	0	a	solid framerate of 7. don't get it unless you somehow know how to fix that (tried disabling HID, still 7fps).
1181	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ FPS and performance ratings.. even on high performing PCs (I can play Fallout 4 and Planetside 2 on very high graphics and not have a single problem) No matter what I do (disabling HIDS or disableing other tasks/programs) it doesn't change, even when I play this game on low graphics. Defective as hell
1182	0	a	This game is possibly the biggest influence for Saints Row 4, however, I'd say it's not anywhere near as good. The story is hard to follow (might be because the voice acting is terrible, could also be because the story is kinda really very boring).  For a 2009 game, the visuals are really horrible. Lighting and shadows seemed a little closer to 2006 levels (I was playing with everything maxed out)  The controls were alright, though it wasn't anywhere near refined enough so the game felt cluggy from time to time.  The game most likely requires some work to get running well. With Nvidia cards, it's less of an issue, but almost everyone seems to suffer frame rate issues of some sort. If you are running with the an Nvidia card, I'd suggest leaving Vsync off in game and use the control panel (This should really be standard practise).
1183	0	a	It works for the first few minutes but it crashes afterwards. It was a good game. It's a shame that it does that. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at all. It'll be a waste of your time and money.
1184	0	a	A giant heap of terrible console port. With a i7 6700k and a gtx 1070 I manage 20 fps. Sound has awful clipping and desync. Got the franchise pack on sale and I would write a review for the second but it doesn't even launch. 0/10 wish I could get my 7 dollars back.
1185	0	a	this game's port is a joke Can't run the game on lowest settings even with the required specs  really if you port something take your time on it
1186	0	a	The audio in the cutscenes is choppy consistently and the framerate is extremely low in gameplay. Sucks the fun out of a great game.
1187	0	a	Hell no.  Only thing better than the second game on here is the story, and Alex as the character. Which you can get in the second game, so really only the story is better here. The combat is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Why target any of the 30 enemies infront of me, when you can target a broken, unthreatening tank behind them?  Why grab the enemy infront of me when you can turn to the left and grab a giant rock or car?  The absorbing is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing slow. Second game, you grab a dude, jump, slam him down and instantly absorb him. Here, he has to do some long fancy move first which is EASY stopped if you are even tapped.  Their idea of challenge is put you in a small location where YOU are the target of everything. First you fight humans, who half have grenade and rocket launchers that bounce you everywhere when you are trying to fight. Then are blessed by large monsters that are fast as hell and can easily throw you around too.  Which they find then a equal hate for just you, and you then have 40 enemies to then deal with.  Bravo! :D I honestly see 0 playing value in it. Even for 1 more second of my time. It is among 1 of the worst experiences with a game I had to deal with.  I am just sad I can't still get a refund and buy something worth the money.  I played games with bad stories but the gameplay kept me coming back. But this has a ok story with god awful gameplay. It can be fun, until you keep getting long repetitive missions over and over. Here are 90% the missions: *Destroy 10 of these acrossed the map.  *Guard this for 20 minutes.  With the every so often: *Kill this guy  game is like a 4/10 for me. I envy the people who couldn't get it to run for them. They atleast could get a refund.
1188	0	a	I booted up the game and watched the 'intro' that you get after idling for a brief bit at the start-up screen, and to my dismay, the sound was completely insanely broken. 'Maybe it's better in the game', I guessed to myself, and proceeded to fiddle with the options, as one ALWAYS does after buying a new game.  But lo and behold, I then noticed that the highest resolution option available is a measly 1280x800. I wasn't aware of the fact that this game was made in gÃ¶ddÃ¤mn 2002. 'Fine', I thought, and went with it. I fixed the controls (the ones necessary, anyway, since I'm using a 360 controller for it), and exited the options.  I tried starting a new game (oops, spoiled it there, didn't I?) with the key word in that sentence being TRIED. Yeah. I can't even start the game proper without it crashing. Three failed tries and a cursory google search later, I've come to the conclusion that this is not a game that was designed for even REMOTELY modern computers.  TL;DR: THIS GAME IS NON-FUNCTIONING. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. 0/10
1189	0	a	I tried playing again recently and I realized within the first 2 hours why I never bothered to complete this game. Considering that the game is no longer supported and also doesn't work well on Windows 10 with newer graphics cards, I can only recommend that people give this game a pass.
1190	0	a	good game. i first played this game on my xbox 360. when i first bought it i was disapionted with the game. but i figured i would give it another try. no thumbs up or down... it would cool if there was a way to play it in full hd. but no only 720 for this one guys... save your money
1191	0	a	This game is a terrible PC port. I tried to start playing this again but it crashes upon trying to load my old save and crashes upon trying to start a new game. I love the actual game but if they can't even make it playable then it is trash.
1192	0	a	Repetive  and looks awful and is bland
1193	0	a	The console version is better, an obvious port, I do not recommend.
1194	0	a	This is a good game on ps3 so I figured id buy it again for pc... this game sucks on pc its buggy the resolution makes everything widescreen the keys are laggy and sometimes unresponsive (usually during important times or right after a pause) story wise its a good game &amp; theres more cutscenes in the pc version but overall I can't recommend it.
1195	0	a	as much as i love this game, i can't recommend this game to any pc gamers. its a port for as far as i can see. i had a few problems running it and optimalizing it. turst me, the game is awesome, but get it for a console. i'd tell you more about the game, but if you dont know it by now, you're not really intrested in this kinda game. probly.
1196	0	a	You're more likely to get this game running on a toaster than a PC.
1197	0	a	The world is pretty large and varied and the powers are fun as hell. But the combat in the game is just abysmal and you will spend 90% of all boss fights and large encounters stun locked. About the worst thing you can do to a player is not let him do anything in combat except be ragdolled around because literally every enemy down to the smallest soldier has a gigiantic aoe attack that stuns you. Hope you like getting chained down 100 to 0 over and over again. Unless you like running in hitting one punch and then jumping away to heal 70% of your health for 1 minute so you can jump in and punch once again. Just painful and slow. It may have fine in 09 when this came out on console but it has not aged well.   Story is good at least.
1198	0	a	I haven't even gotten into the game yet.   But there is this incredibly stupid glitch. That the dev's haven't even bothered to attempt to fix. The games resolution will be stuck at a max of 1280x800. In order to get around this, you have to do a ton of messing around with files (potentially downloading a .dll file to replace theirs, so that you can get a full 1080p resolution.) There are some simpler solutions, that have worked for some people. (Lucky them.) They haven't worked for me yet. I haven't even succesfully gotten the game to work yet. I shouldn't have to spend this amount of time to get it to work though. Especially when I paid for the game.   This will stay a 'NOT RECCOMENDED' review, until someone fixes this bug. Which I HIGHLY DOUBT will happen, since this game is flat out too old to be worth their time to fix it. It's a bummer this bug is here. Because it is preventing people from enjoying this game.  EDIT: I fixed the resolution issue... but the .dll modification I had to make, doesn't allow for any AA. Which is total bullcrap in my opinion. 1920x1080 is an incredibly common resolution. The game dev's should have made this game fully functional with it, before release.
1199	0	a	Bought this during the recent sale (May 2015), and definitely cannot reccomend. Game has been abandoned by the developers, had horrible crackling audio (fixed via lowering sound card freq settings to ancient standards), and it won't run above 720p (at horrible frame rates even so).  I'm just so tired of buying an older game on Steam just to find it's broken and I've wasted my money. Vote with your wallets, and avoid this one.
1200	0	a	Game would frequently freeze and would experience substantial delays.  Just wasn't intended to run on modern platforms.
1201	0	a	Bad port, buggy, terrible AI, cant target accurately, repetitive gameplay  despite your character being overly powerful its hard to realise is true potential with such a mess  1/10
1202	0	a	I should have listened to all the bad reviews for this game and not bought it, but not for the reasons I thought...  when I started the game it was stuck at 1080 x 800 p or something like that. which means I could not get it to go fully full screen no matter how hard I tried.  I was ok with this though. to me the gameplay was worth it, enough to bypass this.  then I found out how the music just wouldn't play much outside missions menu's and combat. again I was ok with this.  I was even ok with the fact that most of the voices did not work forcing me to read subtitles.   I imagined everyones voices pretty well in my head.  but then came the thing I was not ok with. I call it the stupidly complicated frustrating mission of ultimate bullsh*t!!  it starts of with you entering a science base. I totally messed up at the stealth but got in anyway. I thought the game was quite forgiving, and I was so so wrong...  right after getting in and watching a cutscene I am told to lead these big tanky infested zombie things to a military base. and they one of THE most rage inducing stupid enemy designs ever!  they can run faster then you, chuck stuff at you with perfect aim and worst of all their close combat attacks track you. its like they have hacked aimbot into their fists!!  sure you can doge them if you run around like a mad man like i did, but to really hurt them you need to hit them with close combat combos, and when you do they just go 'NOPE F*CK YOU!!' and interrupt it with an attack that is faster than yours.  then they stunlock you until you are nearly dead. so the game ever so helpfully recommends that you kill them for more health. you could always try to kill other things for more health like enemy soldiers but they like to focus on you and only you.  so when you do try that they beat the sh*t out of you until have have as little health as you started with.   but the mission... oh the mission you fight them on is so much worse...  first 3 of them come in and you have to kill them all, then 8 more after that and 10 more after that!  all the while alex mecer (main guy of the story. the one you play as) is saying stuff like 'bring more! ill kill them all!' and 'i could take on a 100 more!' NO YOU CANOT YOU STUPID LITTLE BABY! NOW SHUT UP!!  so then after running around in circles like a mad man while the miltary shoots them like I did, or you somehow mange to kill them by yourself (in that case I am in awe of you!) you are told to blow up a bunch of fuel tanks to kill the stunlockers of doom, by using the rocket launchers and granade launchers that are impossible to aim, while somehow not getting stonlocked to death.  once you do that it triggers a cutscene were the zombie monsters are killed by the explosions.   only moments before they were face tanking 12 rockets at once!! so the fuel tanks explode the monsters die, and alex mercer stands right there as the ENTIRE BUILDING FALLS ON HIM!! without taking a scratch when ingame rockets do hurt him!!  the players reward for all that? a smug c*cky grin from alex mercer and bullets in your face as more soldiers shoot you right afterwoods.  just die already you stupid game and stupid baby face alex mecer!   3/10 already anyoing issues, game crashes for some,it won't even start for others and controller breaking frustration.
1203	0	a	This game is completely broken on PC. You are only able to start new games. If you try to load a game it crashes. There are some workarounds but who wants to jump through hoops everytime you want to continue your game. I went out and bought it for 360 instead.
1204	0	a	This game used to be one of my favorite city sandbox action games, but it hasn't aged well and has performance issues on new OS/hardware combinations, and it's such a shame! What a great game abandoned by the publisher on PC.
1205	0	a	Fun game, crap port. Requires all sorts of fiddling just to bring the framerate up to a proper amount, feels like you're emulating it rather than playing it.  Again, fun game, but I can't reccommend the PC version as it runs like crap. 18FPS unless I go and disable all my HID Complient devices? You're kidding me right?
1206	0	a	This game is the definition of mediocre. It's like if you took the most frustrating moments you have in Saints Row 4 and made the entire game out of it.  The soundtrack is forgettable, the graphics are very bland (you'd think the blood and gore would be more vibrant), the gameplay is repetitive. A lot of the upgrades on your powers, and your powers in general, are useless when you either A. get a better power or B. find out that the best course of action in every scenario is to use the military weapons.  I think that's what ultimately killed this game for me: you have such a variety of moves and powers to use, but in the end it's best to keep it very simple and straightforward.  And one more thing: nobody in this game will ever SHUT UP. I was uninterested in the story as it was, but I had to go and mute the dialogue completely to stand the rest of this game. It would still make the master volume quieter when someone was supposed to talk, which was incredibly annoying too, but it also made me think to myself over and over 'Why would anyone be speaking right now?'
1207	0	a	Prototype Pros and Cons ------------------------- Pros- stealth and some creative ideas like patsy and consuming people to gain upgrades and fun to run up walls  Cons-Frame rate dips constantly to single digits from 20-30, story is confusing and badly told; to many powers moves give wired button layout. Collectable will not show up till you get close and no way to track them, city layout is boring and really poor dialogue; Alex in cut scene sounds like an everyman that got a short deal, but then goes and kills hundreds of people, gameplay-combat gets frustrating and traversal gets boring, auto lock-on is not helpful 
1208	0	a	super glitchy, and controls are laggy and poorly layed out
1209	0	a	crashes right after the loading screen. This is a problem for a lot of people but worth it if you can get it to work
1210	0	a	Game is fun, but it's very poorly optimized.
1211	0	a	I didn't run into any of the porting bugs (resoluion, sound, graphic, et al) but the story and game plan on this are hard to suggest to anyone that values their time.
1212	0	a	Boring and repetitive gameplay. Twitchy camera that loves to jerky around, making it tough to track your targets. Weird sound bugs that cut in and out during the 'story' segments, which mean you can't understand what's being said; very annoying. I completed the game, so my total is about it for length, unless you want to do all the side missions, which are even more boring and repetitive then the main story; add a few more hours if you do. Combat is fun for a bit, but the game loves to spawn stuff in the moment your back is turned, literally, which kind of makes it pointless after you shred your 10th helicopter in a row. The only way to end it is to fly away, where they lose interest in 10 seconds, after you killed 100s of their men. Also, the combat take a dive towards the end when you fight the super solders; QRTs every time you fight these guys, and if you miss it, it will really hurt. On top of everything else coming at you (there is ALOT), these guys really ruin the flow of the combat, only way to beat them beyond shoot/throwing stuff at them is the QFT; pretty bad in a game where free flow combat is the main draw. Additionally, weapon balance is poor, why use anything else after you get the sword? Yea, unless you looking for absolutely mindless slaughter, and can tolerate the camera, you should probably pass.
1213	0	a	Playing Prototype was a red haze. The games protagonist Alex Mercer is an unrepentant sociopath and embodies the Prototype worldview. Mercers obsession with vengeance leads him into mass murder, which in turn makes it impossible to root for him. He actually uses civilians as 'medi kits', absorbing their bodies to replenish health. One of the primary quest givers is Mercers sister, and not killing her seems to be Mercers most humane act.   In fiction, the most obvious way to justify the anti-hero's acts is to make the villains even more evil in comparison. Prototype is not afraid of the obvious, and the military and the private sector seem to be psychopaths to the last man.   The gameplay is OK but unspectacular, with Mercer having access to various powers but gaining upgrades at a very fast speed indeed. The speed of Mercers movements is very fast too, and going from place to place is actually well made. The typical activities (obstacle courses, kill challenges etc.) do not fit the game, at all.   Prototype is nasty and nihilistic and I cannot recommend it to anyone. Prototype fans were somewhat disappointed when Mercer returned as the primary villain in 2, but that is what he was all along.
1214	0	a	I have to admit I have had a little fun with this game, but it's not that good overall. The combat is repetitive and boring.
1215	0	a	Meh. Mediocre game that gets old after about 5 minutes. You're better off buying a cup of Americano.
1216	0	a	I don't know what the big fuss is about; I do not like this game. I realized very quickly that this game is just a rehash of that old open-world Spiderman game. They just replaced Spiderman with Alex. Not to mention that I feel extremely overpowered and I am not that good at video games for the most part (50+ hours spend only on the first level of Demon Souls before I switched to PC). There's also the fact that the cut scene audio clips and cuts out constantly even when I turn down the settings. I bought Prototype and Prototype 2 and now I am out $20 because I am most likely not going to ever play them again.
1217	0	a	crashes at startup no solution in site prototype 1&amp;2 Don't buy
1218	0	a	This game is probably good, but it does not work for me since it just crash in the loading screen when I try to start a game. I searched it up on google what to do and some people tells me to go to the BIOS to disable hyper threading, but im not a high-tech IT guy and this should not happen on a game. 5/10 because its probably a good game, but does not work
1219	0	a	The game doesnt work, it stops working everytime I start a new game, and closes it. Aditionaly, the game wont recognize any graphics card that has more than 1.5Gb of VRAM, and will limit your gameplay to 720p and no Anti-Aliasing. Two fixes were found so far for this last problem, but one wont work with steam version of the game, and the other involves changing a dll inside the game system folder, something like a crack. It worked for me in the menu, but the game is still crashing.  The fact is the game is broken, and there are no devs around anymore. If you want this, I sugest you search a little bit about its problems. And make sure the refund is available.  [EDIT] My specs: Win10 64bit 16GB ram 2x780ti SLI i7 4930K  [EDIT2] I just found a workaround for the crashing: Going into the computer BIOS and disabling the CPU's HyperThreading. I still dont recommend the game.
1220	0	a	This Game is a time waster. a rip off of infamous second son. and its 30$?? dont buy.
1221	0	a	Wish I could play this game to give a better review, but the audio bugs and god awful lagging in the FIRST CINEMATIC prevented me from even wanting to get to the first mission. I looked up ways to fix it, and even the '100% FIXED!!!!!!11!!' solutions for it weren't 100%. You'll have to do a lot of disabling and shuffling around/deleting of files to fix the issues.  So in conclusion, this game isnt worth the full price, nor the On Sale price (I got it for $4.99).
1222	0	a	This game doesn't work well with a keyboard and mouse. The game also gets boring after some time. The gameplay is too repeitive.
1223	0	a	Super-villian simulator, horribly optimized graphics. story most likely written by a teenage comic writer wannabe, but the movement and fighting were not that bad. Worth the bargin-bin price of a sale only.
1224	0	a	Could be an ok game if not for the controls that make your character feel like your driving a bus.  Helicoptors also have a tendency of dissappearing and appearing where ever they please. doesn't matter if you were going to attack them or not or if they are a few feet in front of you. Very unrewarding gameplay makes you just want to uninstall  -0/10 don't bother  also for some reason the recent news for Prototype is   This Prototype Legend of Zelda Cartridge Can Be Yours for a Mere $150,000
1225	0	a	Great Game until... the developers decided to do a mission ('Under the Knife') with infinite enemy respawn. Played 30min killing the entirely population twice... but the enemys keep respawing out of nowwhere and if you want to run away, dont even try, helicopters do unrealistic movements and keep on your butt, there is no escape, not on ground nor the sky. My brain hurts after this 30min killing everything in sight session. &lt;3
1226	0	a	Opening the game works but when you complete the 'start new game' and set your difficulty, the game just stop working. Every time I tried it it just crashed.  I am running Windows 10-64bit and the game does not work.
1227	0	a	this game gets boring very soon. take that as a personal assumption, it has interesting mechanics and what it seems a decent story but i found it being clumsy and repetitive.
1228	0	a	Sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥. Won't even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING START
1229	0	a	The resolution won't go beyond 1280x800 without downloading a third party mod. I refuse to have to download an untrustworthy program just to make my game not look like I'm playing it on a smartphone screen.
1230	0	a	Hate having to give this a bad review since i played the hell out of it on console and enjoyed every minute. The pc port is simply broken with crashes on loading screens and less than acceptible resolution locks. My game won't even allow me to start a new game; it simply crashes. Still haven't found anyone who knows how to get around that. Its a great game ruined by a shoddy pc port. So sad when that happens.

1234	0	a	I was able to get the game running and max out the graphics without issue. However the targeting system in the game and the camera angles are absolutely terrible. Since that's a huge part of the game it's largely unplayable.
1235	0	a	I can't really comment on it fairly. For me it doesn't work without going at about 15fps. Which is odd considering I can max out crisis 3 on ultra setting without a hint of slowdown. I've tried getting it to work but no joy. So it will be relegated to never seen again. Apart from that, I remember it being pretty good on the xbox 360. Time has not been kind and it hasn't been updated. Highest res is limited and as I side it was choppy choppy choppy. I cannot really recommend it, but remember it might just be down to my crapness with making software work. I am just one of those types that likes it to work without needing me to hunt through forums and get in touch with long lost relatives.
1236	0	a	Broken piece of crap. Sorry, can't put it any other way.
1237	0	a	Prototype is a really good open world PS2 game.   Yes, it was built for newer consoles, and on PC it should look even better, but for some reason it just feels like it's a Playstation 2 quality game. Every task feels samey, the enemies are boring, and the acting feels like it did before anybody with any decent acting ability would voice characters in a game. I find it impossible to care about anything that happens.  Despite all that, if this game actually had come out for the PS2, or for the PC at the same time as, say, Star Wars Battlefront, it would have been amazing. I would have loved it, and I would have played it for hours on end. Now, however, it's just filled with that sense of disappointment you get when you go to play a game from your childhood that you loved (GTA3, for example) and it's just terrible by today's standards.   For a better super-jumping, punch-exploding open-world experience pick up Saints Row IV when it's on sale. It's better on every possible level, unless your only deciding factor is whether or not a game has zombies.
1238	0	a	Boring mechanics, dumb enemies. Buy if you absolutely have nothing better to do with your time.  (Note: Play time is off, I've actually spent 12ish hours in this)
1239	0	a	Doesn't Work. Want my money back. 2 gtx 670s and intel i7 3930k cpu and 32gigs of ram. Can run almost any game on the face of the planet yet activison and steam is telling me it's my rig. Well I'll suggest save your money and do not buy prototype. Interesting enough second one works. maybe a different studio i don't know. Prototype 2 isn't as good as the first imo.
1240	0	a	Not as good as it seems. Despite its an open world game it's sorta buggy, And sometimes your computer will lag if your surrounded by many enemies. Sometimes you will be attacked from many places and you'll get hurt without knowing where the enemy is shooting from. But, hey if you like the game good for you.
1241	0	a	The game itself is pretty great actually. BUT DO NOT BUY IT if you had a hex core processor. You need to turn off some cores manually in order to launch the game.
1242	0	a	The visual engines of both Prototype games behave in a strange manner:  1. They need to run at 60 frames per second on 60 Hertz to have smooth motion, were it not for the insane amounts of stuttering. This stuttering looks very much like an extremely severe case of microstutter, yet I only run a single GPU setup (1 x GTX 780 TI).  2. Running the games beyond 60 fps (either through disabling the vsync or running at higher Hz) make them look like a 30 fps game. It looks like the engine repeats every frame even though any framerate counter will state that the games run smoothly at any Hz rate the monitor is set. (eg. 100 fps on a 100 Hz display, but it looks exactly like running a constant 50 fps on 100 Hz.)  Both engine faults give me a headache when I try to play the games.  I've tried every 'fix' I could find on the internet (including disabling all HID devices, running at the lowest in-game graphics settings, adding command line parameters, setting processor affinity, using the resolution fix .dll, etc.) and none worked for me.  So I know this isn't much of a review of the game itself. It might be good, but I never got to experience it myself because of these technical issues which I admit being sensitive to. Therefore, I can hardly recommend the game, now can I? I did, after all, not have a fun time playing this game.  As such I feel I need to not recommend it. You might not have issues with it however, so keep that in mind. Yet, I still wanted to write these words of warning to those few people who might have issues with this game if smooth motion is kind of a must for them, or to those who loathe bad PC ports in general.
1243	0	a	Bad controls, bad animations, bad dialog, bad ballence. This is a bad game. It's not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it's not like i'm mad they got my money, it's just bad enough I wish I didn't own it because I'm not going to play it.
1244	0	a	bad game for PC users. The game will crash all the time. Not werth the money. 
1245	0	a	Won't run on a newer comp without old drivers.... And it is only played in lower resolutions.
1246	0	a	This game as well as the sequel are good on console.. but awful on pc. The gameplay is frustrating on any difficulty (I tried it on multiple difficulties) and it is at the point where I cant play this with mouse + keyboard without slamming my head against a wall. Get it only if it is under $5 and you have a controller to play with. To the developers that shutdown - Thank you for shutting down your atrocious company, have a nice day, f**k off, and I will be back to beat your s****y game once I get a controller to use.
1247	0	a	It's an pretty cool concept, but the controls for this game felt very slippery which made things a bit more difficult than it really was.
1248	0	a	Wow. This game DID NOT age well by any means... Bland, repetetive, and awful graphics...
1249	0	a	I was pretty excited about it based on reviews and what I heard from friends, and the intro section was a lot of fun, where it gives you all sorts of ridiculous abilities and lets you just run around destroying things for half an hour to learn how the game works. Unfortunately, immediately after that it takes away every single one of your fun toys and makes you start over with absolutely nothing. 'Here, go play a completely different game that isn't any fun at all instead for several hours and earn the right to have fun again,' it says. I slowly started unlocking some of the neat things I'd enjoyed playing with in the tutorial, and it got a bit better, but it was too little too slowly, and I got bored five hours in before it was able to recapture that initial excitement.  For random comparison's sake, it feels a lot like a single-player version of DCUO to me, only with tighter controls and a much less interesting, less colorful world, with a fairly bland story and unlikable characters. The gameplay probably would've been enough to save it if it hadn't completely turned me off by taking away all my fun I was having.
1250	0	a	Honestly, I find this game to be extremely boring and repetitive. It all comes down to two big things; you vs military, you vs big bad monsters. And as you advance in the story, the enemy simply get a power-up (as well as you).  The missions are all the same, you either infiltrate a military base/destroy monster base or kill the 'boss' (which is simply one of the power-up enemies that you will now find everywhere).  If this wasn't enough, the controls are actually quite clunky, camera/targeting is extremely confusing at times.   Also the story was quite a letdown.
1251	0	a	This game is super repetative. I did not enjoy any part of it, to be honest. I do not recommend. :C
1252	0	a	So, I purchased this game on the Summer Sale of 2014, so I'm not too upset about the amount of cash I spent on this game. At first the game delivers a very fun feeling in the introduction. After that you're stripped of all your power and made to play out Alex Mercer's story. The story seems interesting enough that might make me want to go back and play this game.  What truly turned me off about this game was the combat system. Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the combat is more clunky then 1980's T1100. When trying to pick up firearms from dead enemies you better get ready to press that button over and over (so help you god if you have an enemy near you and you end up grabbing him instead). Also, the first hunter encounter, oh god..... is that suppose to be a challenge? That isn't a challenge, that's just annoying. The targeting system is counter-intuitive at best, 'Oh let me target the guy in front....aaaaand I targeted the tank behind me). I want to enjoy this game, but holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I think I have to either get high turn or just tune it down to easy and faceroll it. (I really don't want to do that)  P.S. Is it just me, or this game's audio is really low or what?   P.S.S A game from 2009 that doesn't support 1920x1080 without a fix is kinda sad. 
1253	0	a	Pure crap. Don't buy it. It's no wonder the makers went out of business.  #1) The game is rediculously hard.  #2) Because it's so hard, you'll never make it to the end. I wanted to see how the story turned out, but just couldn't get past a certain point.  #3) There are no cheat codes, so you can't just turn on god mode and then continue with the story just to see what happens.  Pure crap. Don't buy it.
1254	0	a	I didn't enjoy even a second in this game. Many frustrating things, like controls and movement. Even the story wasn't good. Prototype just isn't fun, nor entertaining.
1255	0	a	+ Solid Framerate - 1FPS  got 80 mins into and didn't even get to the main menu
1256	0	a	well for 10$ i am really disapoited though i bought the game to try it out and stuff but after playing 5 seconds of it i am going to uninstall it i wasted my 10$ on this game to which it could have gone to something a lot better then low graphic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game and the funny thing is that i had had the setting set to the max and still played like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the movement was bad the look of is was bad sad to say this but i wish i got my money back for this game so i HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND this game
1257	0	a	I thought this game was boring. The map was just the same buildings spammed over and over. Hulk Ultimate Destruction is the same kind of game but much more enjoyable imho.
1258	0	a	I equate this game to herding a bunch of sheep into a very small corral and then squishing them all at once with a giant hammer. That may sound weird but its the way it is. This game story makes no sense and all of the npc civilians just wander around waiting to be mass squished. They dont even react to whats happening in their environment in any logical way(I mean, at least sheep would try to run away in real life). Anyway, on metacritic I notice its mostly young guys who give this game high marks. Guys who get a kick out of squishing mass quantities of npcs for no particular reason. If thats what you're looking for then buy this game! If you prefer a story behind your squishing, or a story with a hero you can relate to in some way, or ANYTHING else to go along with your squishing, DONT buy this game. You wont be happy. Gameplay is fun for about the first hour and then you realize you are doing the same thing over and over and over and none of it makes sense.
1259	0	a	Won't make it past the first cutscene despite having 8x more RAM than needed as well as a graphics card which blows this game out of the water. I loved Prototype on Xbox, but this virtualization is just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1260	0	a	Worst Game and bad controls. Everything is bad about it.
1261	0	a	 Cons  -Terrible story -terrible optimization for pc -gameplay that consists of janky movement and a useless array of powers -boss fights and missions that revolve around throwing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and using rocket lauchers -game literally gives you the best power and armor and thinks you'll still use the other 4 options -pressing two buttons at the same time has never been harder  Pros  -Trust me i tried
1262	0	a	Was a terrible game, you basically start off as your end game there is no feelinging of progression or accomplishment. Story is very linear and boring. For a game made back in 2009 it looks like it was made in the year 2006. You can more or less completely obliterate anything that is an enemy and makes it feel WAAAY to easy you can't even play on the more difficult settings until you've completed the game once. So it's a peace of cake until you've played it at least 3 times through which makes it more boring then the previous 2/3 times you've already played it...  In conclusion don't buy this game go buy something better save your money just don't buy this game. 
1263	0	a	hate black......................................
1264	0	a	this game has a serious case of consolitis. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, buggy port
1265	0	a	Don't buy this, a lot of people have issues with even getting the game running. I still can't play the bloody thing, and there is no available tech support. Do not buy for PC unless you have complete and total confirmation that Prototype will work with your computer.
1266	0	a	This is a warning, this game is absolutely terrible. As soon as I start up the game I attempt to configure it for my 1080p screen and there is no 1080p option!!!! I felt like I was just slapped in the face!! I looked up this issue on the internet and found that the developers limited the resolutions based on the graphics cards memory, below 512mb and you are severely limited. My graphics card has 2 GB of memory and yet it doesnt allow me to have a 1080 resolution, this feature is severely broken.  Then there is the issue with the stuttering. My graphics card is very good and the processor is also high end but when I move my mouse around to look it moves as if there are set directions you can look at instead of a fluid motion that allows you to look wherever you want.  Conclusion, the game is not playable in my opinion. And this is not even considering that the game provides no challenge whatsoever, it makes you a unstoppable war machine. Don't get this game until it's free (ie, never)
1267	0	a	Its mindless arcade fun where you become so powerful you can't help but behave deviously. Its a bad console port and had a memory leak that caused me to have to restart it every hour or so. Cant recommend it.
1268	0	a	Interesting concept, but ultimately far too repetitve and boring to justify its cost. One of the few games I've actually bothered to uninstall.
1269	0	a	15 quid? Are they pi55ed?!?
1270	0	a	The good thing of Prototype is that you are a superhuman that can destroy/slice/throw everything you see but that is pretty much it. Graphic aged badly, the combos available are too much in number and it's easy to screw up when you need to use a specific attack, the autoaim is slow and if you don't use it it's easy to dash in the wrong way but the worst thing is the story. It's undeveloped, told in a messed up way and full of plot holes, easily the worst I ever seen in an action game and one of the worst ever. Even for 5â‚¬ you may don't want this game...
1271	0	a	system req not minimun: 256mb graphic 2gb ram and dual 2ghz and I still have 15-20 fps what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I have radeon hd 5870 1gb vram, 6gb ram, i3 quad 2.1 ghz. No thanks.
1272	0	a	Worst game i've ever played.  proes: -god-like for first 30 seconds of game  Cons: -BORING like hell,just hit hit hit hit hit hit hit. -plot is very easy but tell in a twisted way that make all.....twisted. -charcters deep as a cow.
1273	0	a	Even though this is really awesome, it's pretty much the same thing as Infamous but less good. You're also really overpowered, and that gets old. (and the storyline sucks)
1274	0	a	29-Jan-2016 : Finished main story Equipment : MSI GT80-2QE Notebook  REVIEW :  Boring, bad story, bad mechanics. This is the kind of game that you play casually, if you just want to blow some steam off. But in this case, you will be frustrated instead.  CONCLUSION : Not recommended.
1275	0	a	Terrible port, just don't even bother. I purchased Prototype for 5$ and feel ripped off, it doesn't even have 1920x1080 resolution, cutscene audio cutes in and out and crackles every 5 seconds, audio sounds distorted, game preforms like sh!t on a 1,000$ rig, can't even play on high (Not to mention there is no FPS slider!) Can't even tell if the game is good, the port is so bad that I can't even put up with it. I regret buying such a broken port, and wish I didn't support it.  0/10 for everything.
1276	0	a	dont buy this game! I got it and when i try making a new game, it crashes! i cannot find a solution online so save your money and get a game that works
1277	0	a	At least they got the name of the game right! This is just a Prototype, you start the game and it plays a intro movie and thats it you can move or do anything its not even a game in its current state its a bunch of bull. How does this have some many good reviews when you can't even play it? I really think the other reviews are fake to trick people into buying the game its a big scam and i am feed up! I talked with brother who took a law class in High School and he said it was 'BullSh!t' so if hopefully this will change your mind. The intro movie is still really cool i just wanted to play something and not watch something so i will give it a 9 out 10 but still not recommend because it isnt a game.
1278	0	a	if you have played the second game then you will appreciate what this was trying to be, but wasn't. The main problem is the 'double tap' to initiate free running which somehow just doesn't perform as it should, and given that you need to move fast when the helicopters descend, it just raises the anger level. I also found that the character would lose punch ability and a restart was needed to regain it and also sometimes the 'exit vehicle' option didn't seem to work. The second game is a classic but the first is not really worth the money, even if you want tpo see where it all started.
1279	0	a	This game has lots of potential, but it falls flat. Controlling your character is a disaster. I'm stuck fairly early on and I'm just not interested in playing the same section 30 times to try and get past it. There are too many other good games I'd rather play. At least I only wasted $5.
1280	0	a	The port's performance is sadly so bad as to make this game unplayable on PC.
1281	0	a	A bad port that controls like â™¥â™¥â™¥. The writing is pretty horrendous, too, but it's the sort of thing you'd forgive for the chance to throw trucks at police helicopters if it played worth a damn. This game really wants to be that badass Hulk PS2 game from years ago but it just ain't.
1282	0	a	DON'T BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ NIGER OF A PC PORT! The game crashes every time it tries to load a save, and I have literally found 10 USELESS FORUMS! NOBODY CAN FIX THIS! THE GAME DOES NOT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING WORK! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU ACTIVISION! YOU ARE CORRUPT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥S!!! BUY ON PS3!!!!!!!!!

Bad port â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u who ever made this port, i do not think that this is a bad game but its total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t that we have to deal with this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, buy it on consoles instead because it literally plays like one. So lets start of with 1 there is no 1920x1080 resolution, 2nd barely any graphic options 3rd capped at 24fps seriously wtf, and for some reason the game struggles to get even 20 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fps, and my pc specs are an intel i5 4670 16gb of ddr3 ram and a gtx 770 2gb card this is completely unacceptable for pc gaming. Infact this port is so bad its properly better on consoles dont bother with this garbage, even if its 99% of its a waste of broadband download and waste of space on your hard drive, this game does not work.

1286	0	a	Janky Controls.  Decent Animation  
1287	0	a	Awesome game overall, the superpowers, destruction and the city just feels great. The negative things about the game is that the pc port is bad. First of is the max resoltion is 720p. The shadows and graphics are outdated even if you compare it to other games made 2009. There is next to no no graphics options  Framerate problems Awful keyboard and mouse controls  Its a game worth playing, its just no advantage to play it on PC.
1288	0	a	This game was a mess. The controls were really touchy and the lockon system was completely counter-intuitive and made it almost impossible to lockon the the target you really wantedmaking it feel like you pushed the buttons first then crossed your fingers and hoped your character moved the right way. The main character's powers were mediocre when used in battle, it was better to just steal enemy weapons and vehicles to fight with giving the feeling that his powers were more why he was hunted than what made him cool. The characters were unrelatable and the story , while it had a good premise, felt poorly executed. Add on that a half-dozen of the side quests were broken in an amazingly frustrating fashion and I have to say I'm suprised I finished the game at all.
1289	0	a	After more than two hours of attempting, this would not run on my PC (Win 7, 64 bit, can run basically every game on Steam).  Activision no longer supports the game.   Buyer beware.
1290	0	a	Non starter with my 4930K, SLI GTX970s and Win10 x64. not sure if I should refund my $2.... Oh well.....
1291	0	a	This game sucks.
1292	0	a	To the man who designed the final boss battle:  I would like to bang your head against a table untill you become paralized, then force you to watch as i surgically remove your organs, and feed it to your children in lazania.   I beat your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, now i hope that this scaring game will never be seen or played again.
1293	0	a	Crashes upon starting a new game or loading a save
1294	0	a	I must say that one of the final combat before the final boss did make me totally rage because it is incredibly hard. I never did it, so I never finished the game.  To do quick. The pros : The gameplay is seriously amazing, even if surreal. The open world is really nice. The possibility to absorb everybody is kinda cool too. The cons : The storyline is boring. The militaries are such noobs it's amazing they are still in the army. The final boss is not reachable (see my first paragraph). You cannot possibly love the main character (you do however can like the other characters, it's not a problem). The dialogues are soooo basic.  What is not a pro nor a con : You can kill everybody if you like. The violence really graphic and clear in the game. Not really safe for work.
1295	0	a	Cool idea with great potential that's completely wasted.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by inFAMOUS, but I could not find this game enjoyable.
1296	0	a	Terrible console port avoid getting it for the PC if you can.
1297	0	a	This game is horribly dated. It runs sorta okay-ish maybe. but lets break down the two main issues  &gt;No HD support, No HD texture upgrade from the HD version relesed on console  &gt;Volume regardless of sampling or Hz is incredibly low to the point of not being able to hear anything with a dual sub surround system.  Refund submitted so I can just buy prototype 2 instead.

I'm not all too sure what it does to make up for all its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iness, but it still a decent game when bought at 5 bucks. Anything above that is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rip off though. I feel bad for anyone that paid full price for this. So it mediocre overall, buy it if you're bored and have some money to spend I guess.
1299	0	a	Looking at this game, you're probably wondering...'Should I buy [Prototype]?'. It depends. Prototype is a basically the definition of a murder simulator. All you do in this game is kill and attempt to hide.  The AI is crap, the locations are meh, you see the same civilian about a billion times in the same area you are in, the missions have barely any variety (other than kill more people and run up a building) and Alex Mercer is so emo its not even funny.   So should you get this game? The only thing [Prototype] has that GTA, Saint's Row, and Just Cause don't have is extreme gore and constant killing in grotesque ways. If you want something with a bit more depth than that, I would advise you to look somewhere else. Otherwise, welcome to New York, Mr. Mercer.  Verdict: PASS

Next time i torrent games and then decide to purchase afterwards. Glad that the franchise backfired on the producers and forced to shut down. These type of spamming with so-called 'games' should not be allowed on the market.  Regards,  The entire gaming community
1308	0	a	It is an OK game. Gameplay is repetitive, and story is very dumb. To get the whole story you have to consume peoples memories, which is a very daunting task just to know what the hell is going. I wish the character was more engaging. They also used the same cutscene three different times in game.(where he is talking to soldier and helicopters attack in backround). Compared to the hulk ultimate destruction this game doesn't do much to innovate.
1309	0	a	This guy has a vagena and not in a good way.
1310	0	a	I had this game on the PlayStation3 and it was kinda enjoyable. Ripping and tearing apart innocent citizens and soldiers alike, destroying everything, ellbow-slamming a tank - there will be gore and explosions everywhere. Sounds decent, right?  A little.  Only problem is the controls where a bit clunky (even on the PS3) and I had massive problems focussing and attacking the enemy I actually wanted. Another funbreaker is the fact that you're easily being bounced back, even by small and weak enemies. It's even worse when stronger enemies and helicopters chase you. Sometimes you're feeling like a ball in a pinball machine.  This game has so much potential and with proper implementation this propably would have been the best anti-aggression-game and there is. I mean, you have all those amazing powers! From disguise to running at super speed to hammerfists (lets you smash tanks), clawhands (rips and tears everything apart), whiplash (for taking down distant enemies), superjumping, semi-flying (gliding). You can even throw buses into helicopters and stuff, the list goes on and it's awesome.  But you're almost not able to live it up.  The story is ok and acceptable. The missions are way too hard and not fun at all (I'm not a good gamer, though). In one mission you have to flee. Excuse me? I'm a godlike creature and can destroy a tank with a single blow with my ellbow, why the heck should I flee?  That's boring and uninspiring. It's like getting a Lamborghini in a racing game and the game tells you to drive not faster than 30 miles per hour. Unfortunately, I didn't find any cheats or mods for this game. I think with a little effort like removing all the time based missions and the bouncing this would be just awesome.  If you can get this game for a decent price (it's under 10 dollars mostly, on Humble Bundle even cheaper) and if you do like gore, GO GET IT and happy ripping and tearing bodies apart for a while. I really hope you could do an devastator attack on some people out there who are wasting so much potential. It hurts, especially as a creative person.
1311	0	a	No matter how much I struggled, fought, and screamed, this game would NOT run on my pc, which can play almost every game on Steam on max, or high settings at LEAST. The game would boot up at the wrong resolution, being a tiny box in the corner of my screen, with no way to make it fit despite my fiddling with the resolutions. So many things wrong with this game, I can't possibly type it all unless you want a page-long review. it runs SLOWWWWWW and just basically unplayable. Terrible purchase choice. Do NOT buy!!!!

1312	0	a	I managed to get half-way through PROTOTYPE and ended up writing over my save file in an act of confusion, all because the developers made one of the worst PC ports I've ever played. There's no chance I'll be playing through all of this again anytime soon.  Here's the main issues I had with what would be an otherwise fun and enjoyable game:  â€¢ Shadows are completely nonexistent for those who have AMD graphic cards.  â€¢ It's impossible to continue without having the game crash. In order to fix this you need to start a new game with a new save, quit back to the main menu after the first cutscene, and then load your original save file. This is where I got confused, after not playing for so long, and managed to save over my old file.  â€¢ The volume in this game is extremely low. I play with headphones, for almost every game I'll usually set the volume to around 40% through the little controller on my headset. I find it hard to hear at 100% with PROTOTYPE, there's no other way to increase the volume.  There are no fixes for these issues, there's no FOV slider which would help with how claustrophobic the screen is. The developer went bankrupt and no one gives a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the people who bought this in such a broken state, so I insist you not waste your time and money or you'll only end up as frustrated as I am right now.
1313	0	a	The story is uninspired and the main character is as bland as stale toast. The camera and the targetting are on the same stick so you will constantly find yourself in situations where you have to choose between panning the camera or getting a lock on something - only to have that target switch to yet another unlabeled target whether you have line of sight or not. You'll be ragdolled out of maneuvers constantly. This includes 'consuming' people to restore your health. This means you'll grab someone, start to eat them and have the animation interrupted by one of the dozen (at least) incoming attacks. Maybe it's a bulky melee hunter, maybe it's splash damage from the thirty-five missles and tank rounds, doesn't matter. Trying to restore health anywhere near an active battle (and the battle will follow you around corners, onto rooftops, and also see through your disguise instantly once the Super Soldiers enter the fight) is literally setting yourself up to be mauled. I'm lead to believe the studio that created this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ went out of business. With the design decisions they made here I have to say everyone who plays videogames is better off.
1314	0	a	Let me start off by saying that the concept of this game is amazing. Who doesn't dream of having super powers? Being able to run, jump, and glide across city blocks in the blink of an eye is quite the rush. On top of that, being able to shapeshift at will (as a disguise or to transform your body into devestating weaponry).  The problem for me is after about 10 hours of playtime, why am I struggling to find the will to continue playing?  There's a story, but it feels like a narrative that I'm unlocking rather than experiencing. It's completly mission-based. The game quickly turns into a free-roam-the-city-to-start-x-event. To become more powerful I destroy and kill everything. To complete missions I destroy and kill. To learn more about the story... destroy and kill. Let me put it another way... you get reports on how many kills you get and how much money you cost the military, and the higher these numbers are the better your score is.  I could really only reccomend this game to people who: a. Like GTA style games (maybe only those who really enjoy stealing tanks and trying to evade the police) or b. Are into the revenge genre
1315	0	a	Horrible game. I cant compleat it because of glitches and controls
1316	0	a	Broken â™¥â™¥â™¥ sound problems if you are using an onboard sound card. Fixes found online just break other parts of game. Either way completely unplayble unless you like playing games completly muted.
1317	0	a	Not the game, but the port is poor. I booted it up to have major sound issues where everyone talked so fast they sounded like a record skipping. This was atop poor resolution issues, and I coudln't get far enough to say if the controls were wonky or not. Don't buy unless you're willing to play tech support hero to make the game run.
1318	0	a	Prototype has its ups and downs, but more downs that ups. The main character has some super fun super powers that allow you to do some really crazy things as you fly, jump, or run (horizontally and vertically) through the city.The game also looks pretty good. The story seems really fascinating as well, but that's about where the good ends.   First off, the city gets pretty boring pretty quickly as there is nothing really unique about the city that makes any part of the city look any different from another part. I found myself just following the quest markers on the mini map and not trying to learn the city at all. I never knew where I was unless I pulled up the main map. There are lots of cool powers, but when the fights get going you are so busy running around trying to stay alive and kill that you never really get any time to really bask in the fun of watching a cool ability when it is triggered.   The main negative is that it appears that the controls for the PC port didn't translate properly. The keyboard presses are super sensitive. I've been using this keyboard for a few years and dozens of games, so I am comfortable with it, but I never had such problems with the keyboard in any other game than I did with Prototype. To top it off there was no sweetspot for mouse sensitivity either. Either it took HUGE hand sweeps to turn left and right, with the mouse, or my camera would go sitr crazy at the slightest twitch when trying to adjust the sensitivity. Also y-axis sensitivity was way more sensitive than the x-axis.    As a result, I could barely control my character as I bounced off walls, hitting things, or attacking things except the actual mob I had selected as my target. My character looked cool going bat crap crazy all over the fight zone, but if this game had been real life, the people I was fighting would have thought I was an idiot as they easily gunned me down, which is what happened during game play very often. I eventually got so ultra â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at the lack of character control that I finally quit and removed the game from my system. Experiencing the story wasn't enough of a draw to make me spend many frustrating hours getting killed constantly and wander through a boring city. I'll read the story on Wikipedia or something.
1319	0	a	I really want to like this game, but can't. The idea is great and your 'super powers' are awesome and so fun to use. But the difficulty level is all over the place, some missions are extremely simple while others are extremely hard. And the combat... Everytime you take a hit you get stunned for a while, so you often find yourself taking a chain of hits which you can't do anything about. It makes some missions extremely frustrating.  Try Saints Row 4 instead. It has taken the super powers from Prototype but removed the frustrating parts of the gameplay.
1320	0	a	Unplayable one of the worst ports I have ever played. Solid 13 fps no matter what the settings even on the menu's, audio was skipping in cut scene's and some resolution bug ment I had to play it in 720p. Screw looking for fixes just going to get a refund for this and Protoype 2 which wouldn't even start just kept getting prototype2.exe has stopped working. Maybe its because I have ATI/AMD graphics but even if you have Nvidia don't support this game.
1321	0	a	The Prototype 1 Better game but  i wait for prototype 2 but now it took me feel bad for that game   
1322	0	a	having never gotten around to playing this game i was really looking forward to playing it, always looked interesting and im sure it would have been fun to play!  had i been able to get in the damn game, whenever i tried to get into it it crashed.  oh sure i could get into the title screen and settings, but what good does that do me?  save yourself the money and buy a game you CAN play.  and yes my pc should be able to run it, i checked the specs, if it can run things like fallout and games like it at maz graphics and such, this should run fine, it just doesnt
1323	0	a	Get Saints Row 4 instead. Or Just Cause 2 even.
1324	0	a	PC version is complete trash if you have a higher memory video card.
1325	0	a	The most I've ever disliked a sandbox game. Boring, tedious and stupid.
1326	0	a	Great game, tons of fun when I played it a long time ago on a rig with Windows Vista. But if you have Windows 7 or later, forget about this game because it will be nothing but god awful trouble getting it to run, which is why I voted to not recommend it. If you do, have a xbox 360 controller to play this because if you use a mouse and keyboard it stutters horribly. If you have Win7 or higher, go for Prototype 2. And use a wired xbox 360 controller for that too because using keyboard and mouse also causes stuttering in that game as well.
1327	0	a	Buy Prototype 2 instead. The original is a terrible game - as the game progresses, they use more and more cheap methods to prevent you from getting your attacks off - interrupt upon interrupt upon interrupt. Your targeting seems to target the WORST possible targets, no matter what weapon you use. Again, this happens more and more as the game progresses. This game sucks. Prototype 2 on the other hand, is a fantastic game.  Don't buy this stinker. Save your money, and use it to buy Prototype 2.
1328	0	a	Don't buy this.   Lots of consolitis in this one. A camera that wants to do its own thing and frequent slow character animations that take you out of the gameplay. Third-person platforming. Enemy AI is terrible, and enemies just spawn around you rather than following a sensible path through the city. There is no persistence to the game world, making the missions to clean up the city completely pointless. The missions themselves are repetitive. Ends in a frustrating final boss fight,
1329	0	a	DO. NOT. BUY.  Barely runs on many computers because it's poorly optimized. I can run Crysis 3 on HIGH but not this on low.
1330	0	a	Would be a decent game if the bosses weren't ridiculously overpowered, the game has many bugs one being that it crashes A LOT. Meaning you have to restart A LOT of missions because you can't save during them.  I appreciate it's an old game but come on, it can't be this bloody awful.
1331	0	a	Runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the work around to get it to a point that's playable is stupid. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
1332	0	a	this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ too old for 2016 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ayy lmao xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
1333	0	a	been stuck on the loading screen for 127 minutes now, hopefully it comes around
1334	0	a	&gt; Repetitive Gameplay  &gt; Boring Story  &gt; Good Level Design  &gt; Compatent Optimization  &gt; Gross Textures  Not even worth it for free.
1335	0	a	A total waste of Time and Money... But hey, I have a lot of fun throwing cars at innocent people yes. 'Had'
1336	0	a	Bored... :( ... Timepass Game
1337	0	a	In short:  - Uninteresting story. - Mediocre Gameplay. - Anticlimactic final boss fight. - It took me less than 16 hours to finish the game. - Expensive upgrades.  Hopefully, Prototype 2 will be better.
1338	0	a	  WTF,, this audio to gg.. no sound -_-
1339	0	a	What â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I've had bowl movements that port games on PC better than this. $20 retail!? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Activision! I want my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing $5 back. I have a radeon 7870 grapics card, and AMD FX-8350 8-Core 4.0GH cpu. Can't run this smoothly on low setting. What a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horse â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1340	0	a	While I do love the detail put into the dismemberment and gore of this game, the story falls short and well, to be honest, some things feel weird.  I know, I know... 'It's an old game.' But that's not an excuse for the cars to seat deformed polygonal people inside. Some little things like that broke the inmersion and overall experience for me in big ways.  I'd say check out Saints Row 4. It's this game on steroids but add some personality, mature comedy and a slew of mini-games as well.  This isn't a terribly bad game, there's just better alternatives that are now available on the Steam market and well, this isn't worth the asking price. A fair price for this game would be 25% of what they are asking for.
1341	0	a	This is pretty much the worst copycat game I have ever played. And there are some pretty crappy copycat games out there. I'm sure for those of you who haven't played InFamous, it was great, but please, for the love of tater chips, play InFamous. The series so much better. And no, I'm not saying this because the graphics are terrible. I've been in love with InFamous since the first one.
1342	0	a	I don't really like the controls or narative style of games like this, what i call openworld sandbox games(red faction, infamous, GTA, etc) I only played the intro and turned it off. Feels and looks super dated now.
1343	0	a	Don't buy it unless your PC has only 1 CORE WITHOUT MULTITHREADING Or if you want to spend all day on the BIOS configuring stuff for this game to work :/
1344	0	a	Prototype is an action-adventure open world game. You are Alex Mercer, a man without memory armed with amazing superhuman powers and the option to go most anywhere you like and do most anything you want once you get there. A virus outbreak has claimed Manhattan, forcing the island into a military quarantine. The infected citizens turning the population into mutants. The main story path is entirely linear. The missions are a sloppy mix of poorly paced ideas. Long missions involve simply going from one end of Manhattan to the other, while some of the short missions are climactic sieges and battles. Missions can be brutally challenging, often because of the uncooperative auto-lock system. Boss battles are much longer than they need to be and more often test your endurance rather than your skill. As you work your way through the game, you will earn experience points that can be used to unlock new and ever more exotic powers. Experience points are also the only thing you get by finding collectibles. The graphics are not the best, buildings and environments are ugly, so the world is not a place you want to explore.  All in all, the awful boring and repeating missions and linear gameplay ruins the overall experience.  Sounds 5/10 Graphics 5/10 Gameplay 6/10 Atmosphere 5/10  If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation 
1345	0	a	Edgy McEdgeface runs up buildings, 'assassinates' dudes (by brutally beating the to a pulp in front of his enemies) while zombies, hulking behemoths and attack helicopters chase him down.  That's not even a mission - just a normal day in New York. Sounds like fun, was fun when I was edgy enough to enjoy it and unlock most of the powers but soon enough it just becomes a slightly worse version of GTA.  Between the graphics and samey gameplay, I cannot recommend this game while it's more than Â£4
1346	0	a	I had hear about this game and I saw the offer 75%, so I brough it to try out...It very boring.  Waste of time.
1347	0	a	Bad pc port  Just like gta iv  screw this mÃ¤n
1348	0	a	i want refound
1349	0	a	Does not work on pirated versions of windows, would not reccomend
1350	0	a	i was told this game was similar to the infamous series and while they werent wrong, it feels like activision just played infamous and tried to make a knockoff version of it. both games were made during the same year and yet prototype feels cheap and lazy with the graphics of something id expect to see on a much older console. There's no atmosphere and the main character is very two demensional with the sole goal to kill everyone that experimented on him.
1351	0	a	-Prototype-  Where do i begin...?  There's no immersion whatsoever in this game, it's all very unrealistic and the game looks like utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If you toss a car, everything it touches happens to magically blow up.. Guh.. I'm really trying to remain logical and give a good review. But i can't. I literally hated this game, and don't know why people hype about it. The story is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and your abilities are so dull. Heck, even Prototype 2 is garbage too. All they did is fix a few flaws, and updated some textures.
1352	0	a	Graphics look much better on pics.
1353	0	a	This game sucks.  Want an in-depth review why this game sucks? I found the sound messed up really hard so I could barely hear the dialogue when there was any. It didn't stop me from understanding the story, but it did â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off. The story is boring. It's a typical amnesiac with super powers trying to figure out the past. I liked it better when it was the Bourn Identity.  Gameplay started out funny but immediately got stale. I really don't care for stealth missions and I didn't see a need for them in this game, but it went ahead &amp; gave me stealth missions anyway. The whole thing felt poorly balanced. You're this super ultra killing machine and there's always a seemingly infinite number of soldiers on the screen all spread out shooting at you at all times and you're trying to kill enough guys to keep regenerating health. Then they introduce these mutant alien things that take for god damn ever to kill. I got really tired of fighting those things after about the 28th time.  You can steal vehicles, but it wasn't really adding anything to the gameplay. About 8 or so missions in, I just got bored of the game and decided this wasn't worth finishing. I was on normal and I started out laughing like 'hahaha this is so easy' to having a heart attack trying to finish a mission. I get that there were more super powers to upgrade, they seemed mostly useless from the description. The novelty of the game wears off after about half an hour or so. It just didn't seem like it was worth finishing.
1354	0	a	Big arms and Flesh everywhere. It was bad. (3/10)
1355	0	a	Having looked through my reviews on steam, to see which had been helpful, I noticed my review for Prototype had only 2/7 upvotes. Since my free trial on PS Now has just run out, to get over my craving for infamous, I decided to look for games like it on PC. Prototype was the closest thing people could come up with, so I redownloaded it.  I forgot why I disliked this game so much. But as I said before, the controls were off, the camera was dodgy and the graphics were poor even when I had disabled some things to get it above 30fps and downloaded a fix for the resolution cap of 720p.  The controls feel like they were made for a controller, and it is trying to take the same input from a keyboard and mouse, but one of the most infuriating things is how aiming moves requires an analogue stick and so it is very difficult to aim attacks. Also, the camera changes sensitivity depending on what is happening, which may be alright for someone experienced with a controller, but with a mouse it is the height of frustration.  Also, whilst I suppose people who only use one monitor may not be bothered by the resolution, it is forcibly set to 30fps and 720p which is not only annoying, but it makes the game unplayable in many situations.  Once you have fixed the resolution and frame rate cap, and gotten used to the controls, I suppose the game is ok. I don't remember the story from when I spent most of my time in it, but that doesn't mean it is bad. The graphics are poor (not aged well in my opinion, still rather polygonal in some areas, and flat textures trying to mimic rough textures), apart from abilities which look rather cool because they are meant to be black masses. I don't like the gameplay enough to play for long periods of time, although the carnage you are capable of wreaking is fun in short bursts.  I wouldn't buy this game, as it isn't story heavy so I can't see any problem with getting prototype 2 if you have to have a game like this. If you want a game like infamous, as I do, I guess the best course of action would be getting better internet and paying for PS Now, which isn't that tempting (as it costs quite a lot, and you have to pay that amount every month with no discount for buying several months in the UK)
1356	0	a	It won't load past the loading screen at the start.
1357	0	a	Outdated, horrible controls, horrible camera, 'I wanna be Saints row, but I don't know how challenges.'
1358	0	a	The game is a glitchy hunk of junk. Frankly you will be lucky if you can get it to work.
1359	0	a	I always wondered if this game was good or not since I first heard of it years ago. Yet, in the end it's really not that speical. The story is weak and a complete button masher. I don't mind button mashers but the story should at least be stronger than what is presented. The plot is simple and boring but the idea of the story is good. It was just poorly brought out. Even though I can play almost any game, I feel that I would have to force myself to get through this one. If I wanted to play a game similar to this, but better, I would play InFamous. Yet, I can not complain too much about the game. The idea and upgrades are cool. It's fun if you want to cause complete chaos with your overpowered character, but that's it.
1360	0	a	Nothing but gratuitous killing. Where's my refund?
1361	0	a	Bought this on sale and let it sit a year in my library before finally installing it. Sadly, I have the opening cinematic crash problem others in the forum have mentioned experiencing (game crashes to desktop upon starting a new game). Don't know the root cause (the game being six years old at the time of writing may be a factor, I'm sure), but for me at least the game is literally unplayable. Obviously. there's no patch ever coming. Pity! I was looking forward to finally sitting down with this game. Hoping for better luck with the sequel...
1362	0	a	It could be a good game but its just not working. after fixing the reselution and the sound bug i though i can play a great game now. But no. Even if i have a strong PC the game starts to lag. In the cut scenes the sounds i buggy even if i fixed it before. Also it only supports xbox360 controllers which forced me to play with keyboard and mouse.  I think his shouldt be for sale because its not even working.  Story i interesting tho even if i only got the beginning.
1363	0	a	Not happy with this along with Prototype 2, i have played these games on the Xbox 360 platform and i do enjoy these games, i have migrated most of my game play to the PC as i CBA to buy multiple platforms to play the games i like the most, on purchase and download of these games via steam ( Taking into account my Pc Specs i shall disclose below this comment ), i found myself disappointed.  I Cannot run Prototype 1 without serious lag and on the games lowest settings and its tedious that prototype 2 just does not load ( Crashed during basic startup ) i have reinstalled these twice and ensured my rig has its SLI correctly setup for the game.  I ran system requirments lab and well it says i have the minimum for prototype 1 ( il post the link also as its still confussing as it will not disclose the Recommended )  I have both minimum and Recommended for Prototype 2 ( again i can post the link )  My system is pretty high spec and high performance and i can play without a doubt Most games...there has not been a game ive played that i have had issues with and my hardware is quite recent.   i have also tried to go to activation for support but their support for this game on these games for this platform do not come avaliable on their website.....which is frustrating as there is a need for it i believe.  anyway here are the specs of my pc ( Below ) and all in all i would not recommend anyone buying th pc versions of this if they are below the spec i am about to post.

1364	0	a	This game will load (which is more than I can say for Prototype 2) but i get a framerate of 5. only 5. frames per second. so i'm glad i got it on sale for $5 but i would have rather gotten a burger, at least i would have been able to do something with that.
1365	0	a	its worth about 3 minutes and 11 seconds of entertainment. SO, how much are you willing to pay for that?
1366	0	a	An interesting concept brought low by mediocre writing, acting, and rocket-launcher stun-lock. Also, the PC controls are about as precise as waggling a dead salmon at the screen.  This is not to say that you can't still have fun with the game, just that fun doesn't seem to have been in the original design document.
1367	0	a	Let me start off by saying, this game has over 250 collectables. 50 of those...are tips on how to play the game. Yes that's right, you'll be searching for tips on how to play the game, that you've mastered to the point that you're concerned about getting collectables....Yep.  Apart from that, the art direction is cool, the pre-rendered cutscenes are awesome, but the story and in game cutscenes leave much to be desired. The gameplay is fun, but has way too many poorly planned challenges and mission requirements which will make you pull your hair out.  Buy Saints Row 4 if you want to run around having fun with super powers. Buy Resident Evil if you want an outbreak storyline about mutant monsters. Don't buy this game (unless there's a steam sale, then why not right?)
1368	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS GAME.. ITS A GIANT TURD THAT WONT FLUSH.  It doesnt work and there is 0 support for it. You wont even get an answer from the company that makes it.
1369	0	a	Warning: This is a review on how the game runs and not the actual gameplay, mechanics, or other features  Guys just dont do this to yourselves. The game will not run on your computer unless you do some crazy internal work deep within the dark unknown of your computer's settings and disable a whole bunch of things that you have no idea what they do. I repeat IT WILL NOT RUN......PERIOD. It doesnt matter what kind of computer you have. (If its a computer with better specs it runs worse then before)   Now, if you did find out how to get the game to run, good for you man its a pretty fun game. To clear this up it is not IMPOSSIBLE to get it to run eventually it is just very COMPLICATED to do so.
1370	0	a	Overall: not a bad game, but has many annoyances that will add up and impair your fun:  -several sections of the game are just plain obnoxious (getting swarmed with enemies that knock you down every few seconds EACH)  -due to above obnoxiousness, standard strategy is to /not/ use your mutant ability arsenal and instead steal a tank and fire from a safe distance.  -Web of Intrigue is cool but no way to tell where targets are unless you are very nearby, so getting a full Web means running on foot through every street.  -Abilities are interesting but only 2-3 'modes' are well developed  -events are repetative and bland (kill x within y, time trials)  -City is big and parkouring is fun, but its visually boring.  -On the plus side, the stealth AI is hilariously inept. You can literally drive a tank down the streets, mowing over civillians and cars, and still be completely undetected.
1371	0	a	I tried really hard to like Prototype. It has an interesting enough story, tons of power to murder many, many people with, but simply put, it runs terrible. It averages maybe 20 FPS, dropping into low single digits if more than just the main character are on the screen (often). The menu is clunky, and the controls and uninutitve and unresponsive.
1372	0	a	Fun for a few hours...not much past that.
1373	0	a	more like phototype because of the bad frame rate
1374	0	a	This IS a good game. BUT BE WARNED -  Multiplayer is littered with hackers and cheaters.    There is a noticable number of players who are one or more of the following:    Invincible    Able to kick other players at will    Able to unlock max rank etc.    Using aim bots    Using wall hacks    Have unlimited knife/melee distance    Able to control public lobbies as if they were private ones    and various other things.   Infinity Ward/Activision don't care, they're busy squeezing cash out of fanboys' pockets. I've contacted Activision support multiple times, and they literally don't care at all. Considering they're still charging Â£20 for the game, I'd say that's disgusting...  It's a great shame, because it has a great single-player, great co-op, and the multiplayer IS good, but people have ruined it. All I can really do at this point is go to their Steam profiles and report a violation. Some people will rage in the text chat 'why must you hack? it's ruining the game' or similar, and 99% of the time the response is 'hahaha cry more' or 'shut up u â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥', as you'd expect. It's be GLORIOUS if these toxic people were VAC banned, but I doubt any of the higher-ups will do anything about it.  Not so much angry, as I am sad.  Edit: Steam displays my hours played in single player. I currently have 69 hours in multiplayer at time of edit.  Edit 2: The 'unhelpful' votes for this review are from fanboys who are infatuated with grenade launchers, trickshots, and probably some hackers themselves.  Which reminds me... the playerbase in MW2 is   outrageously   toxic. The number of times I've been called a f#ggot, had cancer wished upon, been told to kill myself, insulted for using a certain weapon or equipment... seriously, someone wished for my mother to die of explosive diarrhoea because I was using an MP5K. I don't get it.
1375	0	a	If you like hackers you'll love this game.
1376	0	a	IT's a good game, but hackers are crazy on this one. and then you geta VAC ban and you cant play it any more
1377	0	a	What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking,  'Why is the multiplayer dead?'  The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hackers and children. Hackers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hacker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warefare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hackers and cheaters.  Some examples of hackers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:    Wallhackers   Aimbots   Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks   Hud-Hacking (Yes, it does exist)    Instant VAC Ban   The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.  Please, please,  please  watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are  safe , but the player count is very little in most game types.   If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small.  I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the Spec-Ops, and the Singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hacked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hackers...  -Cheers  
1378	0	a	As for singleplayer, it's good, but too short and lacks options.  As for multiplayer, all it is is a cancerous daycare center for 9 year olds.
1379	0	a	A great and excellent game but too many hackers, making it unplayable.
1380	0	a	Most people remember this game as the last good Call Of Duty Game. The multiplayer is good, but you should probably buy this on console. The multiplayer is entirely plagued with hackers. The neglect from Infinity Ward and hacking has gotten so bad to the point where hackers can ruin your game, and since Steam cloud saves your data, it's impossible to fix in some cases. There's no word from Steam when the community asks for soloutions.  There are groups of legit players who play private matches, if you can find one, it's fun, but that's more of a tactic to avoid hackers for people who already have the game.  Some of the things hackers can do is change your resoloution, your minimap size (to the point where it takes up the whole screen.) These problems can be fixed by deleting you config files and verifying your cache. They can also corrupt your rank, and this can't be fixed, unless you get into another hacked lobby and they rank you up to 70.  This is a GOOD multiplayer game, but I'm going to thumb it down because of how prevelent hackers are, and people should know about. Unless you already have people to play with, I wouldn't buy it for PC.
1381	0	a	This is going to be my first not recommended, but not because of the game because it's a great game. I had so many good memories of playing this game on Xbox 360 a couple years back, but that was not the experience I came back to. The servers are now all full of hackers and aimbotters and players that are invincible. I was so hoping to jump back in when a friend bought it and play a couple games with them and really show them how much fun a Call of Duty can be before all the added stuff from Black Ops onwards. Please do not purchase this game unless you do not plan to play multiplayer (which that is the only reason I purchased it). Fair warning to all.
1382	0	a	 -----EDIT-------  A lot of people have been accusing me of cheating in MW2 Multiplayer lately. This is entirely false, I did not cheat whatsoever. At the time I was playing there were (and probably still are) A LOT of hacked lobbies. What happened to me was I logged into a modded game. After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying ' Bad host '. So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried. I looked up on some forum, found that people encountered the same problem and that you need to contact support as soon as possible otherwise it'll ban you. I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying ' Cheat detected '. I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned.  ALSO NOTE:  I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is 'solutioNNN' and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.  -------------------  Singleplayer: Wonderful! Special Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great! Multiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN. I do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline. Oh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before   getting a possible permanent ban .
1383	0	a	IF You intend to play the campaign and special ops buy the game and have fun!  IF You only want to the multiplayer, You will be facing the most irritating cheater and also the worst community of all Call od Duty games. For multiplayer buy other games, including other COD's but surely not this one.
1384	0	a	Game itself is great. Hackers have ruined multiplayer, though, and they just laugh and change their name and are back on. There's one in almost every match.
1385	0	a	Was a lot of fun on xbox when it first came out, but PC is currently filled with way too many hackers.
1386	0	a	50,000 people used to play this.   Now it's a ghost game..
1387	0	a	This game is great but to bad the multiplayer is full of hackers
1388	0	a	used to be a great game, but hackers ruined it! You can t play it anymore. So sad!
1389	0	a	fallen prey to ever Cod game that ages. it's over run with hackers and players who arent there to enjoy the game, but rather to irritate you with over powered wepons, hacks, and rude jokes (involving your mother)
1390	0	a	The 1939 Invasion of Poland was more balanced than this.
1391	0	a	If you actually want to play the game, steer far clear of this. The hackers have ruined it. The free for all spawns are broken, the aimbotters are plentiful, and if you are playing after 8:00 good luck finding any functioning match. If you're looking for a stupidly unbalanced, hacker infested pool of filth, this is the game for you.
1392	0	a	I joined a team deathmatch 6v6 game on literally the smallest map  everyone was in ghillie suits and using RPGs and gravity was set on low so everyone was a flying sniper rocketman  i came out 10th prestige with everything unlocked  ok its not what I expected for cod 6/10
1393	0	a	Spec Ops is great you can play it with your friends and have a lot of fun. Story line is good too.  But Multiplayer is s**t as to this moment I've played it for 2 hours and I already played with 3+ cheaters, I mean I saw the Kill Cam I know that you have hacks, I'm not saying that I'm great at this game but I see that you are tracking me through the walls.  So you CAN live without this game but it is still good, if you don't play multiplayer.  And I'm sorry CoD but for that kind of money you can get a much better game.
1394	0	a	Game: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Original Release Date: 12 Nov, 2009 Date of Review: 05 September, 2015 Update Febuary 2016: VAC has now been made useless, where VAC bans do not prevent people from playing.  The Good: - No overcomplications, no future/exo stuff. - Special Ops is kinda decent, and the campaign is alright. - Most guns are fairly balanced. - Config files not encrypted. - Fairly well optimised and decent graphics (by 2009/2010 standards) if you put them up to 'Extra'.  The Bad: - VAC REMOVED, cheaters roam free with no punishments. - Abandoned by developers, no bug fixes/patches. - P2P Networking, no dedicated servers (Unlike every previous CoD), therefore more hackers then any other CoD. - No included DLC, even though the game has been out since 2009, so small community split even futher. - The start of Infinity Ward hating PC gamers. - No mod support (Unlike every previous CoD). - No map editing support (Unlike every previous CoD). - Locked 65 FOV (Unlike every previous CoD). - No developer console access (Unlike every previous CoD). - Have to edit config files to customise commands like max FPS. - High cost, few sales. Â£37.99 for the game and all DLC, 6 years after release. - Literally a killstreak that ends the match.
1395	0	a	If you liked Call of Duty MW, then you will be disappointed. They completely ruined the awesome server system they had in the first MW and replaced it with this IWNet bs that doesn't let you choose the server you wanna join. Because of that it has become a paradise for cheaters, hackers and all sorts of rubbish. Combine that with the gameplay that has been more optimized for campers and snipers than ever before. Some of the perks and killstreaks you can acheive with camping are so overpowered that it ruins the whole experience. The single-players is just as good as the other COD games, but I bought it mostly for the multiplayer, so I would say it was a complete waste of money.
1396	0	a	Nice game but too many hackers
1397	0	a	Worst multiplayer I've ever played.
1398	0	a	Decent game totally ruined by uncontrolled hacking.
1399	0	a	Now, Dont get me wrong. Modern Warfare 2 is a good game. But nowadays, you get nothing but hackers who get in lobbys on public and gives everyone a prestiege master hack or unlock all weapons. I would DEFFIENTLY play this game over Modern Warfare 3. And that's saying something. That Infinity Ward needs to stop making Call of Duty games in general. (Seriouisly, Ghosts is NOT worth it.)
1400	0	a	there are enough players still around im mw2 but the game itself is an absolute copy and paste from call of duty 4. the fanbase is one of the worst i have ever seen and they will shout at you for being more skilled than them. it is not fun at all with all these horrible people playing this game. call of duty is very well known for the horrible players. the gameplay is absolutely nothing new and is getting extremely dull these days. you are trapped inside a tiny area with a few other idiots calling each other f@gs, and being attacked by the other team which are also calling you and their own teammates f@gs.
1401	0	a	I loved this game on consoles and PC in the beginning, sadly the multiplayer is now infested with hackers no matter what lobby you go to, simply put. Its a waste of money. The community is now miniscule at best due to the staggering amount of cheaters. Do not buy,
1402	0	a	The game WAS good, but i was kinda late with buying it (bought it yesterday). It was a lot better in the past, now you don't even have servers to join, just a matchfinding system. The graphic style is ugly (i'm not talking about the quality, i'm talking about the too much brown colour in the game). And, i don't like Infinity Ward's CoD, i'm more the Treyarch guy. Imma buy BO3 when it comes. As i said this game was better b4. Don't buy it now, cause you are 3 or 2 yrs late
1403	0	a	10/10 would get modded by hackers and get 5 trojan viruses again   AVG detected 5 files within the Modern Warfare 2 files that were trojans.  will now uninstall this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  To be honest, MW2 isn't a bad game but the VACT (get it? VACT instead of fact) that there is no more VAC makes the game unsafe for literally anyone. Hackers are abundant and virus transfers are too. Stay away until VAC comes back.
1404	0	a	Get the game only if you want to play singleplayer and/or spec ops. I DO NOT recommend playing multiplayer beacuse there are hackers who use improved cheats which can cause VAC bans to non-cheating players on the server.
1405	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game got banned for aimbotting? wtf is that ?
1406	0	a	Despite Infinity Ward selling DLC in all their games, microtransactions in their most recent game, almost never having to pay for server hosting, making more than most other game developers from tremendous sales... despite all of that, they don't spend the money on upkeeping their old games.  It's unbelievable that they drop support for a game once the next one is out, and the PC is always the last priority for them. There is still a ton of life in this game...or even COD4, but Infinity Ward doesn't even look twice at them anymore. Both games are plagued with a LOT of cheaters online. It's almost as if the game has become like a 'Thieve's Landing' type of place... a place where all cheaters get together because they know there's no law enforcement there. Cheaters cheating against other cheaters. It really is something that has to be seen to be believed.
1407	0	a	When i got this game it was great and cool. Over time though there has become a course of hackers and less population. I guess its time to let the good old days die...
1408	0	a	Just too many hackers in Online multiplayer.
1409	0	a	Why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ are all your games $60 forever.
1410	0	a	This game is heavily over rated, the campaign is ridiculous, the spec ops is only enjoyable if you are teamed up with a friend, the multiplayer has no dedicated servers, over-powered killstreaks and guns and has no option to alter my FOV i rate modern warfare 2 2/10
1411	0	a	Probably one of my favourite Call of Duty Multiplayer games of all time. Now is unplayable because the main servers are shut down and to play you need to patch it (illegally) and play on cracked russian servers riddled with hackers and cheaters. Was good, now not. Stay away.
1412	0	a	It was a good game for casual play when it came out, now its broken since there is no VAC active for it. No competative multiplayer, people say that if you buy the DLCs you get locked to play with other people who have bougth them.
1413	0	a	was a descent game but now is a sack of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that has a ton of hackers on like every server no fun sad face :(
1414	0	a	OOHHH BABY ITS TRIIIPLEE GEEEEEETT NOOO SCOOOOOOPEEEEE NO GET A CAMERA MLG DORITOS MOUNTAIN DEW WEED xXx_â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'DESTROYER_xXx 
1415	0	a	Before I start I must explain that the reason I do not recommend this game is not because it is bad in any way, it is because its multiplayer is full of hackers/mods/spam and broken equipment (it also has no developer support).   The game is however very good, the single player has a gripping storyline that is full of action and great cinematic cut scenes. It includes a variety of wepons and settings so that each level is interesting, one level could take place in a desert and the next in a forest. There are intense moments and plot twists that really do get your emotions going, it's possibly one of my favourite story modes of all time. However it's slightly short and on veteran difficulty certain levels can be near impossible without touches of luck.  Single player also comes with 'spec ops' (which can be played co-operatively), spec ops adds another layer of difficulty to the story mode and alters story mode levels to suit a different challenge. It's divided up into a variety of categories including races so the diversity is enough to keep you playing when one type of mission is frustrating you. The frustration is worth it however as when difficult spec ops are completed you feel extremely satisfied.   Overall I would say it is a great game however its lack of developer support and its toxic hacking environment (online) mean it cannot be worth its price tag.
1416	0	a	Short, though intensive SP campaing with over accurate enemies and useless team mates.
1417	0	a	No dedicated servers and hackers basically ruined this game...
1418	0	a	Hacked lobbies, script kiddies, noobtubers, commando knifers and an airspace filled with killstreaks. Every single multiplayer lobby is/has at least one of these, and it is bloody annoying.   As for the single player, 5 hours of linear nonesense (Campaign) and an okish co-op mode (Spec Ops) that both pit you against AI of your difficulty choice, with objectives on screen.  If you are looking to pick up an older Call of Duty, just get the first Modern Warfare. Less bs. More enjoyable.
1419	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. It was the first CoD title leading the series into console â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t without dedicated servers, without a good community without anything. It had good potential but it's full of killstreaks and full of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Sadly I have this game in my account. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
1420	0	a	This game would easily fall into my top ten of all time. I think this is THE BEST COD ever made, and probably well be made. single player is so damn good. But unfortuantly,the multiplayer is ruined with hackers. The fact that steam claims this game is Valve Anti-Cheat enabled makes me sad, there is no enforment of this wahtsoever. Its really too bad becuase this was one of the best games to play with friends, but until the multiplayer is cleaned up i would not say its worth $21.99
1421	0	a	There is a reason why certain people tell other people 'Go play Call of Duty or something'. Now those people may not be the sharpest arrows in the quiver themselves, but they do have a point. In the male brain, there is a little person who leaves the cave only to kill stuff dead. I have one too, and often play videogames with him, but even he thought this was ridiculous. I like the phrase 'Ramirez! Teach me about the magic of friendship!', though.
1422	0	a	Hackers... Hackers everywhere. Literally online you will join a game that is a hacked lobby.
1423	0	a	The beginning of the end for the Call of duty franchise
1424	0	a	This was a great game I enjoyed it alot the only problem is the amount of hacked lobbies is just unbearable and now my minimap covers my hud so it makes the game unplayable Dont buy this game now it too late.
1425	0	a	Well it was fun for a couple weeks, then i got deranked lost all of my unlocks, and my whole screen is a minimap, diddnt get my money's worth..

1427	0	a	I would rate this game highly but now the servers are full of hackers, this game has been out what 6 years now? and yet the community on it thats left gives gaming a bad name, so don't pick this up unless your a sad child who wants to hack a game with pretty much dead servers.
1428	0	a	Pros:  - Nice Campaign - Good Graphics - Very well optimised - Decent first person shooter  Cons:  - The multiplayer is full of sweaty try hard - Rainbow name tags everywhere - Hackers - Everyone is Prestidge 10,Level 70 - Aids
1429	0	a	The multiplayer portion is plagued by crappy controls, P2P servers, hyena hackers, and clan mobbers, but the single-player campaign is surprisingly deep. There are some truly jaw-dropping moments in the game, especially once you hit the halfway mark.  If you're looking for a decent last-gen multiplayer game, there are certainly better ones out there. Don't bother with MW2 unless you need a quick shooter fix and can find it for less than $20.
1430	0	a	Almost every game you play online is a hacked lobby. It's stupid.
1431	0	a	Multi player is alive..with 360/540 people 10/6/2016...of couse 1 out of 2 people are either still using 3rd party walling..but it was worth a shot checking if it was still alive..at lease the hackers keep it alive.
1432	0	a	Ok this was a good game until it got hacked.I played 1 match and already recieved prestiege this is not cool fix this or else not funn 
1433	0	a	The multiplayer is essentually dead. Few players and half are cheaters. Would not reccommend this to anyone for anything aside from the single player (Which is meh as it is)
1434	0	a	graf ok. but i hate that all this 12 year olds gonna 'qickscope' and flame about so cald 'hard scope' why would you qickscope in war?

1436	0	a	Piece of trash game. Please never buy this, I don't know why I have it. If you have bought this like myself â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you and put your god damn head in a fire and hold it there till you die because you are a scum filled â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a human being you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1437	0	a	F*ck you!!!!!  I am so full of rage right now it's unreal. I have been a loyal fan of Call of Duty for a very long time even pre my PC days. I have racked up over 700 hours on COD Ghosts and nearly 200 hours on Black Ops 2. At the weekend I randonly recieved a notification mid game during my gameplay in Ghosts to say that I had been permanently banned from online multiplayer. No reason! Just a notice. I have never cheated on a game in my life, I collect games, I achievement hunt and I have a f*cking expensive PC, all of which pretty much cements me being a solid and dedicated gamer. I contacted Activiton and went on the community hum on Steam and all I am told is it's irreversable and they say I have breached one of their t&amp;c's for fair play. What the actual f*ck?? Why would I rack up nearly 1000 hours to then decide to cheat?! Are they F*cking stupid? I think this is absolutely disgusting and I am totally enraged by this because they have given me no explanation whatsoever other than a link to their policy agreement which is total BS. I am so enraged I am now refusing to buy anything from these c*nts ever again. How can someone or a company have the right to do this to a customer, especially when I am a loyal customer and have done nothing wrong at all. I gaurantee it's a group of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on here that have complained about me in some way to force a ban on me. I have no VAC ban or nothing and never have had one. I hope those pr*cks at Activition read this and I hope half the f*cking gaming world does becuase this is not acceptable
1438	0	a	I've always enjoyed the single player aspect of these games. This one continues where the first Call of Duty left off. The graphics still are decent to this day (2016) and the music can get you in the mood as your shooting down soldiers. The only bad thing is this series rarely, if ever ges on sale. The price for what you get isn't worth it for single player coming in at little then five (5) hours. It's all preference. The mutlplayer component is there but filled with hackers. If you can get it on sale for 14.99 or less I say grab it. Otherwise, your not missing out on anything that has not been done in previous FPS.
1439	0	a	Very dissapointed to spend 15 dollars (i think) and find out that the multiplayer is full of cheaters. At Least i can play the campaign but seriously super dissapointed.  I have 12 hours or something like that on the multiplayer. THIS IS THE CAMPAIGN Not the multiplayer. Thats why it says 0.5 hours on it clam down  If you are getting this for the multiplayer, Don't. Its a waste of money. Its full of cheaters and is pretty much dead
1440	0	a	I hate this game...
1441	0	a	This one was still OK....
1442	0	a	Almost every lobby is hacked and really stupid...
1443	0	a	very bad game
1444	0	a	If you like playing with Hackers, then i high recommend this game!
1445	0	a	got VACd for another person hacking.
1446	0	a	Broken piece of garbage. No dedicated servers, player counter is broken, the in-game invite function doesn't even work properly, hackers everywhere, the community for this is dying out. I played for one hour before someone randomly hacked me to lvl 70 and unlocked every gun and attachment upon joining a match. Get this if you want to see a great example of a publisher who doesn't give a flying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about PC.
1447	0	a	Re-writing my review. As the COD series is on sale right now hopefully some of you will read this before buying MW2. Back when it first came out I gave it a positive review. Unfortuantely, over the years this game has become not only less and less fun, but now, hackerfield. Hackers everywhere. I recently re-installed this game about two months ago to play with some buddies of mine because they were playing. I literally played less than 3 mintues and then uninstalled. Simply because, #1. It was boring. and #2. HACKERS. Oh my gosh. Modded/hacked lobbies and tons of players with hacks, i.e. aimbots, etc. Please, please, please do not buy this game. Save your hard earned money.
1448	0	a	I've owned every Call of Duty, except Ghosts, and Advanced Warfare. I have to say, this is where it all went to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. With the addition of lobbies only, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ maps, and overall â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mechanics, this is the real lemon. This CoD is really what ruined SERIOUS competitive Call of Duty. I spit on the makers of this game.  Made for consoles, on pc, then ported for pc. Absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  -100/10 Would never play again.
1449	0	a	i have played it until the end(4 hours gameplay) and still dont know about what happend,The story is just unineristing!Usualy i love the story of cod (playerd mw1,mw3,cod bo1/2,ghost) but in this story its hard to know why their doing it,I still dont know why markarov is a good character.then the final it was unlogical and unspectacular.Multiplayer:Only hackers more i dont need to say about it.Specialforces could be good but not with no players. Overall: I wont buy it again if I had a choice.
1450	0	a	i hate this game now because i can't play TDM or somthing like that
1451	0	a	This game is terrible. Game is poorly balanced, hackers are all over the place, and the hosting system is so awful I hated myself for playing it. 
1452	0	a	i don't play this and contemplate why it's in my library
1453	0	a	Too many hackers and modded lobbies.
1454	0	a	Omg where do I begin with this one. My steam has 3 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing vac bans from modded lobby\'s. Never buying a cod on steam again now my profile makes me look like I hack.
1455	0	a	Game is good, but unfortunately there are a lot of hackers and therefore receives less than me and the game is already very old and should have all the DLC to be free and not cost much more expensive! for which no one wants to allocate money!
1456	0	a	Great game. Great multiplayer and campaign. The number of hackers in the multiplayer are like ...urgh.... well basically every third player is a hacker. Also one man army + noob tubes pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing annoying but that's the game. If you're getting for multiplayer only don't get this. Even if you only want to play private matches they dont work :(
1457	0	a	Another sequel in the Call of Duty franchise. Not only is this game now very old it is also the bloody same as every other Call of Duty.Hey atleast they had half the decency and didnt reuse all of it right? The gunplay is unoriginal and the game offers nothing new. The graphics were even then when it came out outdated and poorly textured.I do not in any form recommend this game
1458	0	a	I have loved playing this game since I had it on the Xbox 360. However, this version is plagued with hackers, with no real method of action for taking them out (besides a long and laborious external reporting process).   I have never NOT recommended a game across any of my reviews, so this says a lot. Either Activision or Valve need to make this game's online actually accessible. Games without hackers are an extreme rarity, maybe around 5% of actual lobbies. Until then, this game gets a NO RECOMMENDO from me.
1459	0	a	For me this is the 2nd best Call of Duty game only to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. Sadly I do not recommend you purchase this in 2014. Graphically on my Windows 8.1 machine with GTX760 and 16GB memory the game has serious issues with jumping frames and gives the impression you're experiencing severe lag. (Can't find a fix anywhere!)  Moreover, as you'd probably guess with any Call of Duty game, it's been destroyed by kids who think they're hackers. Having some wannabe hacker remove your rank is not un-common. Fair matches are not impossible to find however you never know who is using a mod or what advantage they have given themselves.   Also be warned there are no leaderboards and only a few of the game modes have any activity. Search and Destroy is completely dead.   It's a shame each Call of Duty game is abandoned by the developers so soon after final release, especially considering how much the gaming community has given them.   (Played 4 hrs on multiplayer)
1460	0	a	This game was unfortunately the downfall of CoD. While it fixed many previous inbalances from the first modern warfare, it introduced many new overpowered abilities such as the commando perk and dual wielding shotguns. Not to mention how crazy devs went with killstreaks and even included the game ending tactical nuke. The game is still a bit of fun as it has very satisfying gunplay and can be very intense, but good luck playing some of the more tactical game modes that require teamwork over deathmatch. It also is very easy to get cheap kills that take no skill or for someone to cheaply kill you without really using any skill. The skill cap in general is very low as well seeing as it pretty much an arena shooter with slower and simpler movent, iron sights, and regenerating health.   On top of all of this, this game is a very bad pc port. It lacks basic features that previous pc CoD titles had such as dedicated servers that support up to 64 players. You can also apparently get vac banned for adding a fov slider, a feature that should have already been in the game in the first place  5/10
1461	0	a	It's Call of Duty, the worst game series in the world.
1462	0	a	Too many hackers and modded lobbies.
1463	0	a	Due mostly to it's lack of userbase and limited funtionality as a singleplayer game, I'd say to avoid not only Modern Warfare 2, but the Call of Duty franchise (post the third) as a whole.
1464	0	a	DONT BUY THIS HACKED PIECE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 85% You will end up playing with subhumans. No wonder the sales were good when 1 out of 3 had to buy an new copy to cheat. Buy COD4 or World at War. At least there you wont be put into an position where you bend over and take it like a little b1tch.

1471	0	a	Too many cheaters.... not enough means to stop it and I think the developers care little about it.

1473	0	a	i have played it until the end(4 hours gameplay) and still dont know about what happend,The story is just unineristing!Usualy i love the story of cod (playerd mw1,mw3,cod bo1/2,ghost) but in this story its hard to know why their doing it,I still dont know why markarov is a good character.then the final it was unlogical and unspectacular.Multiplayer:Only hackers more i dont need to say about it.Specialforces could be good but not with no players. Overall: I wont buy it again if I had a choice.
1474	0	a	the single player is short. like really short. its alright I supose but I wouldnt buy this game for single player. I'd save my money for something more expansive with a longer more satisfying ending and a better story that makes no real sense.  the multiplayer is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. conecting takes way to damn long. and the game is just plauged by hackers.  inshort could be so much better go buy battle field 1 instead.
1475	0	a	hate it. nat type strict. i portforward turn my router firewall on, it opens up then basically after my internet resets and it's back to strict. 6 days ago i played mw2 now it says Connecting to IWnet, that closed down ages ago. i cant even play mw2 at all now. thanks for the money steals â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you.
1476	0	a	Ahh Modern Warfare 2, one of my favorite games of all time. but unfortunately it have become a hack fest.  I guess i can talk about the positives about this game before i tell you why i'm giving this a negative review. The things i love about this game, where do i even start. The first thing i can say that i love about this game are the killstreaks. The killstreaks like the nuke changed the whole game and it was so much fun getting the nuke. The other positives are: the guns (AKA intervention), Maps, Perks, campaign, spec ops and everything else. Now let's get into why i'm giving this a negative review.   (This review is only for the PC version, the Console version are still fine and you can get into a hack/modd free lobby easily)   if you are planning on buying this game right now, wait for a Sale. almost every game you join is filled with hackers using god mode and other cheats to ruin the experience for other people trying to have a fun, casual time. But sometimes you might join a lobby where there is no hackers or modders and when you find those type of lobbies the game become so much fun. but you realise that there is a small chance of returning to a good lobby again.  So that's the reason i'm giving this game (ON STEAM) a negative review. the game is almost unplayable with the amounts of hackers and modders ruining the game. So if you are planning on picking this game up on PC you should probably wait untill a sale happens. Or just get the game of Consoles becuse atleast there it's actually playable.  It's wierd giving this game a negative review since i love it so much. But since Infinity ward and activision won't do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to stop the hackers or modders from ruining this game, i'm afriad this game is gonna be full of hackers and modders till the game eventually dies.
1477	0	a	CoD MW2 was the first shootergame i ever played. Back in the days i used to play it on my xBox 360 but some time ago I bought it for steam too.  positive Aspects: + The Singleplayer is absolutely       great

1479	0	a	This game is terrible. Game is poorly balanced, hackers are all over the place, and the hosting system is so awful I hated myself for playing it. 
1480	0	a	you cant find a game for ground war- community is full of modders and hackers.

1482	0	a	What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking, 'Why is the multiplayer dead?' The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hickers and children. Hickers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hicker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warfare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hickers and cheaters.  Some examples of hickers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:  Wallhickers Aimbots Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks Hud-Hicking (Yes, it does exist) Instant VAC Ban  The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.  Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.  If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the spec-ops, and the singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hicked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hickers...  -Cheers  old cod better   0/10 (can I get it any lower??)

1484	0	a	I JUST GOT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING HACKED SO I CANT PLAY THIS AMAZING GAME WITHOUT RAPID FIRE GRENADES GOD MODE AND INFINITE AMMO. I JUST â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BOUGHT IT
1485	0	a	Ok so I have mixed feelings about this one...... I loved everything about CoD up until this game, and as far as the amazing single player experience I think that still stands, but the replayability for me has disappeared with MW2. The removal of dedicated servers, a plague of cheaters and what seems like a much younger (and less mature) demographic of player base, has soured my CoD multiplayer experience for now.   Let's hope it gets better with the upcoming Black Ops.
1486	0	a	Too many Hackers...Ruin the game. One hacker gave me hacks, and that is one reason that I got banned from it because some guy gave me hacks while I was in game then reported me for using hacks which I've never used. Now I am VAC banned and can't post a letter so I can't get unvac.
1487	0	a	A hacker hacked my friends screen, and then i downloaded the hacked client he had just so i could try to remove it from my friends screen. And now i am banned from playing online just because i had a hacked client. So freaking stupid....
1488	0	a	so many hacked lobbies, would not recommend to anyone.
1489	0	a	Hackers, hacked lobbies, max level hackers and lobbies, hacks hacks hacks VAC ban bypass,
1490	0	a	Hackers. Hackers everywhere
1491	0	a	Activison shutdown â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I'd give thumb down for way shutdown.
1492	0	a	Multiplayer is still full of cheaters. Don't waste your money.
1493	0	a	Poor maplayouts and Hackers Galore
1494	0	a	Too many hackers... Hackers killed this game.
1495	0	a	It was a great game in its time, but it has been ruined over the years by the rise of hackers appearing everywhere. I had the game for not even an hour, and I was hacked to level 70. I didnt want that at all, it takes the fun of the multiplayer away from me. Hacked lobbies are too common, and hackers will be found with access to all care packages(unlimited amounts of them), god mode, and unlimited ammo. Now, the story is still great dont get me wrong. But if you came here for the multiplayer I must warn you its not what it used to be. Buy only if you want the story.
1496	0	a	Originally, i wrote a positive review. in hindsight, ive since deleted it.  Sure, MW2 is one of the best CoD games ever created, but the game was released in 2009. its now 2014, so the graphics and gameplay are seriously outdated, and there is now zero support from IW. yet Steam still charges the retail $89.99 for the game.  I PAID THAT UPON RELEASE!  there is zero justification to pay this much, especially considering the community has dwindled exponentially, and moved on to MW3, BOPS, Ghosts etc.  even on special at the moment for $49.99 there is still zero justification to pay so much for a game that is so old. honestly? you would be better off buying CoD4 and have the joy of private servers.  it makes me sad to not recommend this game, but with the blatant price gouging by both Steam and Activision, there really isnt a choice. i just hope this review will stop alot of people wasting their hard earned money that will offer a sub-par experience at best.  off the top of my head, i can think of a dozen games that are more worthy of your hard earned $$
1497	0	a	Call of Duty games tend to get a lot of hate. I got this one for free with a graphics card a while ago. After having it sit in my library for a few years, I figured I'd play through the single player campaign. This is a review of that.  This game is total garbage.  A nonsensical story held together by average shooting mechanics riddled down with tons of red goo on your screen.  Here's a plot summary:  Makarov, a Russian, is bad... apparently. So we go undercover, murder a lot of Russians, get killed, start a war, shoot more Russians, free some guy from jail... who fires an EMP at America, go back to finding the bad Russian guy, get betrayed by our commanding officer for no reason, murder tons of Americans and Russians, talk to Russian bad guy who helps us, and then kill a bunch more Americans, then have a stupid knife fight ending with the commanding officer who tells you that he did it basically 'so people enlist in the military'. Roll credits.  I feel like this should all be an elaborate ruse, but I'm pretty sure it's not. Sad.   
1498	0	a	The Game that started Quick scoping and black scoping which infinty ward has tried to killl in COD ghosts
1499	0	a	Full Of Hackers. I Gave In To Temptation And Installed A Mod, Just Days Later They Re-Instate VAC. Great -.-
1500	0	a	At the beginning it was good but now it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing noob game. There are only guys with noobtubes, autoshotguns and other stupid weapons.
1501	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PC port. Cant alt-tab, cant change my resolution, i get framerate drops all the way down to 5 FPS every 60 or so seconds and i have a good enough PC to run it. The story is ok, I think it's good, but since the PC port is so bad i cant enjoy it. This game is nothing new though, its still the same game when it comes to multiplayer etc. just with a few new weapons and maps. I would not recomend this on PC, buy it on console since iCOD:MW2 runs much more smooth on them.

1503	0	a	After the awesome first Modern Warfare the series just got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. The beginning of that made MW2.  Story sucks compared to MW1. Where MW1 tried to create a 'authentic' atmosphere, MW2 is just unrealistic and ridiculous. It had its moment though. The gameplay is mostly ok; there is not much evolution, but with some interesting, but infrequent, levels which give you the choice of how to act. The SP is worth a try, even though it isn't as good as MW1.  What totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s it up is the MP. MW1 was basically good, but had some issues. Instead of fixing those, Activision deceided to screw the game totally. Here are some reasons. If you are a fan of MW2, please do me a favour, and explain how you can enjoy the game with such problems.  -Way too small maps for the amount of players. Clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all day long. -Complemented with a stupid spawnsystem.  -Matchmaking, no dedicated servers. -Killstreaks. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sake, I don't get it. How can people enjoy it, getting instantly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 6 or 7 times in a row by a guy in a OP Apache in a game which is all about CQB? -Stupid perk system. Why the hell is there a perk which increases your bullet-damage?! -Zero weapon balance. G18, enough said. -Hitdetection and hitboxes. Watching killcames in this game makes me sick.  -And last but not least a totally immature community which is screaming 'ANAL' in voicechat almost the whole time.   I don't understand how this game can be so popular. I also don't understand why Activision decided to kill the franchise and create the CoD disease we have today. Get MW2 for the SP or the COOP. The only way you can have fun with the MP is in a private lobby with 3 of your friends, disabled killstreaks and some rules.
1504	0	a	I removed the game from my steam account for all times. (my soul is clean) Singleplayer is too scripted and brainless. Multiplayer is good but thats not enough for a +review IF you want to play a good fps..buy a Wolfenstein, Medal of honor, Quake or DOOM.
1505	0	a	The single player doesn't even start without crashing, and I have been trying. A lot.  Even in safe mode, the game crashes instantly, and trying to tamper the compatibility settings prompts a 'Steam must be running' error. It's a half-assedly ported abandoned mess that is going to be lost in time and only pirates will be able to play it in the future.
1506	0	a	This game use to be good until the hackers came along which IW don't do diddly squat
1507	0	a	Really good game so realistic besides the fact it bans you for hacking
1508	0	a	rubbish steam effort with no controller support as per usual , and they don't make it clear before purchase !!!!!
1509	0	a	Meh. I've grown up.
1510	0	a	I bought this game because years ago I loved it. It's a great shooter, a real classic of the genre. But, there is a really big problem. The PC version has very few people online and the system for joining games is a joke. Joining my second lobby, the game refused to load the game and it contiuned to do this. As a result I am refunding it.  WARNING TO DLC BUYERS: There are very few games with DLC online and it's a waste having it.
1511	0	a	THIS GAME IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FULL OF NOOBS THAT PLAY NOOBTUBE AND â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS IM â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MAD THIS SUCKS I CANT PRACTISE MY FAZE CLAN VIDEO BECAUSE OF THOSE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING NOOBTUBERS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IM â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MAD OMG REMOVE THIS GAME EVERYONE HATES IT U GOT NO FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1512	0	a	I have a permanent VAC ban on my record because of this game and its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cheat detection. I unknowingly joined one of the many rampant hacked lobbies that the all of the hackers were creating, was instantly max level and had everything unlocked, and then was subsequently banned. Good job Valve...how bout you improve VAC and do something about the real hackers in these games?  Would be 9/10 bomb nuggets, but the hackers and faulty VAC detection make this stank, festering pile of elephant feces a 0/10.
1513	0	a	Lacks a server browser, the main reason to buy a CoD game is the multiplayer, and unless you can coarse a group of friends to buy it, you likely won't have a good time. and it lacks the simple things that most shooters on PC have, like FOV sliders and it has an FPS cap.   The campaign is over the top crap, written by a man with a 5 minute attention span. It desperately tries to grab at some open links to the first Modern Warfare, and although the campaign is big on spectacle, it lacks everywhere else, minus Burger Town, which is sort of this games Volga River/D-Day landing.  A terrible port, it runs well but lacks so many features that any decent PC shooter released in 2009 should have. A terrible entry that started a general downward spiral for a great series. Buy Black Ops 1 or CoD: 4, or one of the original Infinity Ward games instead, those are much better.  Also, it gave me a VAC ban. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off! Worst purchase I've made on my Steam account, at least Ride to Hell Retribution didn't stick me with a warning label.
1514	0	a	Just don't do the mistake what i do because the game it's full of hackers and btw if u will place a hack noane will ban u because it's just full of those wores.It's a good game but full of hackers.This game need a bit more cheat protection because it's easy to place a hack invisible to vac u just can domnate de FFA.I just got a hacker in l00by and he dosen't care about vac bans he sayed: -I play this game whit hacks like 6 months and noane catch me. Now seriously if this game will get a better anti-cheat sisteam i will just play every day.
1515	0	a	the call of duds is bad lelelelelelel
1516	0	a	Game sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ don't play.
1517	0	a	WHY THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DID YOU ENABLE VAC BAN NOW THERE IS NO SERVERS WTF
1518	0	a	Still no favela retured for the PC players and VAC was removed because so few players playing the game. In reality everyone is at liberation mods which allow custom servers (including favela)   I would love to rate up this piece of legend but it's not worth it anymore.
1519	0	a	was fun playing this game some years ago... now it's dead  TDM is kinda fun if you like playing it and if you find a game that isn't hacked and/or Domination  Search and Destroy is totally dead. You almost only find games with quickscope â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s kicking you if you play normal -.-  that one DLC I got has 2 maps I actually like but when activating the DLC you find less games (sometimes not even a single one)  do I recommend this game? nope will you buy it anyway because it's CoD? of course  the quickscoping kiddies got butthurt and disliked the review xD   the spec ops missions are kinda cool
1520	0	a	As of now (I'm sure it's not as of now, now) the game is pretty much worthless to play. Hackers everywhere and it's just simply not worth the hassle to find a server without hackers. It was a great game back in the day but if you want a CoD either buy BOII or any of the more recent CoDs, whichever you prefer.
1521	0	a	Not into the CoD franchise, 5 oppy guns in every game that everyone uses, quick scope â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like someone can do irl, and full of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 8 years old. And yeah, i do play battlefield, 10 times over this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community (not that there arent â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s there..) 
1522	0	a	If I had written this review 5 years ago, it would've been a Yes. Now, however, I do not recommend this game.  MW2 was great for a while. It had awesome sounds, awesome gameplay, awesome guns, sweet killstreaks, really it was just a great â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game. Of course, people exploit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t like noobtubes and commando, and people have gotten too obsessed with sniping. I join a game to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sit in the back and hardscope like snipers do, not quickscope.  Now it's just hacked to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The chances of actually finding a legitimate lobby are lower than the chances of you getting a life. R.I.P. in peace C.O.D.
1523	0	a	Its really bad, you know its bad but you didn't know its *this* bad, its so awful. nothing about it makes sense, the story makes no sense, the writing makes no sense, the general gameplay makes no sense. the gameplay is bad even for a call of duty game, its the most obnoxious first person shooter I have ever played in my entire life.  Do you know that scene in dumb and dumber where they have the most annoying sound in the world? basically that but for like six hours.
1524	0	a	Joins Team Deathmatch, gets in modded lobby, hackers put files in your MW2 directory, get VAC Ban on MW2, quit MW2, start playing CS:GO, Gets VAC Ban in CS:GO, Gets VAC Ban in CS:Source. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.
1525	0	a	this game is... was a legend but now you cant play because on every single server there are cheaters or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ trickshotters lobbies and they kick you every time you are close to win.  
1526	0	a	-Pros: CoD Parodies  -Cons: Spawnkill Simulator  10/420 'blaze her right in the camera' -iGN

1528	0	a	Got VAC banned from the game for something I didn't do. I am not pleased. I owned that game for years.
1529	0	a	just another call of duty game! would not recomend playing online due to the fact its packed with hackers!
1530	0	a	Not into the CoD franchise, 5 oppy guns in every game that everyone uses, quick scope â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like someone can do irl, and full of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 8 years old.

1531	0	a	Personal rating: 5/10 Replayability: Low Budget: If it's on sale and you like the franchise, buy it.  Lenght: Half a day.   Modern Warfare 2 takes everything that was good about Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 and slowly starts decomposing it.   Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 are both interesting games because of the story, but this half-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ attempt to continue a story that really just isn't interesting or captivating anymore, is just... Tiring.   The gameplay hasn't changed, the graphics might be a little better, but in a game like this, you don't really have time to stop and admire the scenery anyway.   The game is extremely linear and you're left with a constant feeling of frustration from not being allowed to make any decisions ever, and basically being treated like a side-character in someone else's story.   If you've ever played pen&amp;paper roleplaying games, this is how it feels to play with a game-master who loves his own NPC's more than he cares to provide a good game experience for his players.   That said, if you can get it very cheap, it's moderately entertaining.
1532	0	a	I don't recommend this game unless you're looking for a short single player campaign and some ALONE coop fun. However the multiplayer and coop parts are totally broken, in MP almost every lobby seems to be hacked or modified in any way and playing this game over LAN is merely impossible due to the matchmaking system and the always online 'Feature' of the Multiplayer. Coop is also very complicated since you have to open ports on your router to sucessfully host a game, same goes for the Multiplayer part. Furthermore Activision and Infinity Ward don't give the slightest bit of support anymore and new hacks and other tools aren't recognized by VAC.
1533	0	a	0/10 - Cod speaks for itself.
1534	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, uttrer â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, full of hackers. Don't waste your money. Please fix
1535	0	a	Got banned, not cool
1536	0	a	Got this game when I bought my new laptop in order to bring back good memories. However, as expected there's only small community of players left meaning that there are mainly only games in TDM,S&amp;D,HC-TDM &amp; FFA. In these games modes there are often hacked servers, low gravity, prestige, wall hacks amongst the other classics.
1537	0	a	Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in itself is not really a bad shooter. It can be quite fun at times, but it's shortcomings are plenty and I would advise you purchase CoD 4: Modern Warfare instead.  The biggest problem this game has is the way servers are found. It has a 'matchmaking' system that forces you to join servers you know nothing about, which are then hosted by a random player in the game. See the problem? Due to this, prepare for wonderful amounts of lag in every game, and in case a player forced to host the server leaves, you have to wait for 30-60 seconds for the server to migrate host to another random player(in the middle of the match). Add to this the fact that you can't pick which settings on a server you prefer, be ready for things like people jumping 50m up and server playing slow-mo or being forced to spin 360 degrees for every bullet you fire.  Another problem are the hackers. Playing this game with a wallhack seems to be a must for most players, as every enemy knows where you are at any moment and will shoot you through walls without you moving an inch, throw grenades at your face or kill you before they even come around the corner(that one might just be the wonderful lag I'm talking about).  Also, the game has a big issue with large monitors. Despite having resolution set to that of my monitor, when aiming down the sight the mouse will move for 5-10 pixels for each 1 pixel it moves when I move my mouse on my desktop, making precision aiming impossible and forcing close quarter combat. Maps themselves also force this, as most of them are made to suit close combat, and you can forget about any sort of tactics, as they are made in a way where you're forced to go down a 'corridor'(whether it's a street, tunnel, building) and the enemy can come only from in front of you, or behind you.  Game modes offered are plenty, but dead. As the game works on forced matchmaking system, you can choose between TDM, DM, Hardcore TDM and S&amp;D. TDM, however, usually contains 80% of the player base, which is around 500 players online normal times.  The game falls short of it predecessor in almost every aspect. Avoid my mistake, as now I'm angry I wasted 12.49â‚¬ on this instead of buying CoD4: MW as I originally planned.
1538	0	a	So this review is about a refund.  i bought this game a few months back and expected to get a fun delightful game and then i log on... people flying around rainbow camos, aimbot, rapid fire snipers, and ect. so i politley ask if i can have the full $20 back

1546	0	a	This is a fantastic game that's been ruined by scumbag â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cheaters and mod users (like there's any difference between the 2 anyway). I've got a list of people who use cheats on here and already my 1TB Hard drive specified for that file is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing full!  Don't get me wrong, THIS IS A LEGENDARY GAME! But it's been ruined by the Community.
1547	0	a	The game itself is good, but the foundation of players it has is horrible, and here is the primary reason: Too much hacking. Every game has a serious, offending hacker that ruins the fun for those who merely want to play the game. They either render themselves invinvible, make themselves capable of firing randomly and killing the entire other team, shoot another player through obviously solid objects such as mountains and hills, and they even warp the game mode (you may select Team Deathmatch, but they will alter it so that you are actually going into Domination or any other mode.) If you really want to play the game, then this is not the option. Just go with Xbox or PS.
1548	0	a	This is one of those nostalgia â™¥â™¥â™¥ games people can't get away from. This game brought in many new ideas to make Call of Duty what it is today and is considered to be the best in the franchise.  Yes. This game has an amazing soundtrack, maps, and guns, but unfortunately this game is horrifically unbalanced, ugly textures and graphics, full of hackers, and a terrible campaign.  It's one of those games where even though you hate it, you always go back to it eventually.  It's like a terrible drug where you know it's bad for you, but you want to keep using it.  I hate this game and I can't stop playing it! Help me!

1565	0	a	As much as I enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it.  There is still no custom lobby support / dedicated server browsing. There are cheaters in EVERY game and it seems that there is absolutely no anti-cheating mechanism in place, since they don't get VAC banned or even kicked. And they removed the absolute best map of any first person shooters (my favorite): favela.  I actually bought this on steam only to be able to play in that map in multiplayer again, and to my enormous disappointment found out they removed it YEARS ago because of some misplaced potentially religion-offending content and never patched it back.  Game has potential, still the most fun CoD, but the devs made very poor choices and basically showed the consumers their middle finger.

1570	0	a	This is a good game, BUT, it does not work as there are many bugs and glitches, the game corrupts easily, and so is unable to be used. Love the game but hate the hackers, cheaters and corruptions. I do not recommend this game if you don't like hackers and wasting your money.
1571	0	a	So I bought the game, installed multiplayer, and started playing. The first game, I was in a hacked lobby. I was a little bit discouraged, but then, I joined another game, and GUESS WHAT? IT WAS HACKED. I was very frustrated and left the game. I noticed that I was level 70 thanks to hackers. Overall, if you want a modded lobby 99999999/10 games, by all means this game is for you!
1572	0	a	well it is 'playable' but I wouldn't recommend this actually.  Just played mw2. Here's what happened.  I invited my friend to play Team Deathmatch together. out of nowhere we're playing Domination. First we said, dafuq?! after that, 2/3 times 'Host ended game' In our team everyone was under level 20 and in enemy team everyone was almost max prestige. Sooooooooooo there's sum ting wong atm.  If you want to play this game, play it on console. Because this game is just a bad port. 
1573	0	a	put 120+ hours into the multiplayer before it became littered with hackers and cheaters who just want to call you a â™¥â™¥â™¥ :/  great game before iw stopped giving a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about it
1574	0	a	It gave me an endless blow job. It was not fun. It had braces.
1575	0	a	This game is really bad, AI is either WAAAAY too easy or its got aimbot, multiplayer is filled with hackers or people who have over 1,000 hours on the game and noscope4lyfe.  Really I think call of duty is ruined, and this was the first ruined one.
1576	0	a	I have had this game for a while and only played just over 2 hours on it. After an upgrade to Windows 10 the game no longer functions; immmediately ceasing response upon launching. It is now unplayable and due to the time I've had it and the play time it will not be refunded. THANKS GABEN
1577	0	a	By far the best COD game out htere, but that doesnt mean anything if you cant play the game though!   I've tried everything to find a game, several tips from pages and steam support is completely f'ed, so i do NOT recomend for anyone who actually wants to play the games they buy.
1578	0	a	This is the game for you if you like shooting things with guns. Cause there are guns in it. And shooting. After I beat the storymode of the game I was invited to shoot more things in multiplayer. I guess I'm good at shooting things, but I really felt like I could've shot more things. With guns.
1579	0	a	This game used to be a lot of fun!  TL:DR; If you play online, you will play against hackers, and not have fun.  Unless you play in a private lobby with friends, (which you can't level up and get new or fun gear in private lobbies) all of the online servers are filled with hackers. And even if those hackers get VAC banned, they can still play and cheat like they were never banned.
1580	0	a	Best Way to avoid VAC ban is...... Delete this game Don't try to play multiplayer  Hacker are everywhere Also If you aren't using hack But If there was hacker or modder in lobby . Well that mean  Every Players in lobby can get VAC. Activision can banned you without reason Some how DON'T PLAY THIS SH*T Great Story Great Co-op Multiplayer is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing 0/10  Play Battlefield is the best way because EA has good anti-cheat system No random Ban  Better than Activision is Banned people without reason Random Ban [ Mostly People get random banned ] OH last thing I want to talk.The realistic is IN REAL LIFE DON'T SAID VIDEO GAMES ARE REALISTIC ! Hey Kids stop saying video games are realistic.  Because Your skinny body can't handle real gun[Even pistol]. Aimming weapon is harded than video game  NOW SHUT OFF YOU COMPUTER . GO OUTSIDE AND JOIN THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ARMY MARINE OR ANY ELSE ABOUT MILITARY ! IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO REALISTIC YOU SH*TTY! 
1581	0	a	For a game to not take serously and just be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ being a noob its quite fun. If you are planning to take it serous i wouldn't recommend this game at this period of time do to the fact of the mass amount of nerds in the game makes it hard to begin as well as the high chance of getting a hacker in the lobby using aimbot or some crap like that. Other than that the killstreaks seem too extreme and that it is pretty easy to get spawned killed. So If you don't give a crap and your playing with a friend and you want to make a some 10 year old no life nerd rage bc you ruin their killstreak by noobtubing then this is the game for you.
1582	0	a	Steam is unable to manage hackers on this game....so , just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !
1583	0	a	too old now and not very good when it was new.......Its not BF2 :(
1584	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK. After a few hours spent in singleplayer, I decided to try the multiplayer. It worked fine at first but ever since that first session it will no longer boot. Have tried all 'fixes' discussed in the steam community but nothing fixes the issue. No updates ran on my computer. No drivers require updating. Reinstalled numerous times. The multiplayer program simply will not start. Crashes upon opening and requires a force quit to close every time.   Contacted Steam to request a refund. They refused as I had spent more than 2 hours in singleplayer, despite the other half of the game not even functioning.  DO NOT PURCHASE. MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK. GAME IS NOT AS DESCRIBED.
1585	0	a	this was NOT the 'last good' COD. this game is horrible. bad gunplay, bad level design bad AI, bad story, bad characters, bad gameplay very quickly thrown together singleplayer without any effort put into it the 'best' thing about this game were the coop missions multiplayer suffers from the same problems as all the other cods after 4: unbalanced and generally horrible gunplay, terrible spawn system, insanely unfair items, bad leveling and unlocking system, bad matchmaking (no servers), unfair killstreaks, HP regeneration, etc. this game is bad, the fact that the sequels are even worse does not make it a better game.
1586	0	a	this game is trash
1587	0	a	You can get VAC banned really easy from this game like me. Perma banned... I cri everytiem. ;_;
1588	0	a	Intesive but extremely short 'tunnel' FPS. That is the whole problem of CoD games. And from game to game it is still pretty the same. Again, again, again, again, again... It's not worth that money.
1589	0	a	Great game, when it came out.... Don't buy it now though, hax are insane. Can't level up legit, Leaderboards are un-fair.
1590	0	a	There are two seperate components to this game.  The single player is fast paced and action packed, but extremely linear. A few stealth sections are present, and are OK by FPS standards. It fulfills its purpose of teachingthe player the controls well enough to play the multiplayer.  The multiplayer is fun in theory, but several problems get in the way in practice.  No dedictated servers ensure near constant momentary lag.   The player base is not very mature, and there is a good number of cheaters.  The unbalanced perk system permits EXTREMELY unfair advantage.  There is no votekick option.  Waiting time in the lobby is quite long as there are many players who purchased the hilariously overpriced DLC map packs that you most likely do not have. The only way to get around this is to pay 90USD for a title that already has a sequel, which has only served to lower the player population.   If you really like the gameplay style, get Black Ops for the console.
1591	0	a	just get a refund but csgo get another refund suicide
1592	0	a	Was a great game but like all old games the hackers have taken over and not fun anymore.

1595	0	a	Great game, when it came out.... Don't buy it now though, hax are insane. Can't level up legit, Leaderboards are un-fair.
1596	0	a	yeah, id really like my money back. I can't find 1 server online that isnt hacked/modded and i can't even play. This game sucks and i wish i didnt spend my money. FIX THIS SOON
1597	0	a	After 10 hour of playtime a hacker made me and a friend level 70 with all guns and attachments.  Was fun until then. Except for the dozen or so modded lobbies and 10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hosts before the hacker.  Don't buy this unless you enjoy playing with hackers.
1598	0	a	too many hackers
1599	0	a	i don t have map in multiplayer for 1 month
1600	0	a	Why would you make a multi player game online with no match making ? What a waste. You can only play the spec ops missions with other people by inviting them, you can't just create a random match like EVERY OTHER GAME OUT THERE!
1601	0	a	mediocre game, I would only spend the money if it was on sale.
1602	0	a	It's so boring
1603	0	a	Get vac ban for nothing
1604	0	a	not gonna recommend this because, its a dead multiplayer game and the story now isnt worth the imaginary bullets you'd be shooting.
1605	0	a	Would I recommend this game back in 2009-10? Yes.  Would I recommend this game now? No.  The game was amazing back in it's day, but now it's just filled with low-life hackers, who ruin the game.  When you want to play some TDM, 25% of the time you will be placed in a hacked lobby and promoted to 10th prestige without your permission (Happened to me). Also because of all the hackers/ the game not being updated, the population of the game is about 500 people, resulting in you playing with the game people from day to day. Don't get it, the game is dead. Yet Activision still makes you pay Â£20 for a out-dated game.
1606	0	a	I don't recommend buying this game now... developers just don't care about this game anymore, it has been 3.5 years since they edited Favela map (because of some painting frame which was offensive to Islamic religion that was hung above a toilet) and they couldn't take a minute to put it back into multiplayer maps rotation. They put it back in PS3 and XBOX, but not PC. I'm extremely disappointed.
1607	0	a	Do not get. Everyone will be better than you even if your using the same gun and attachments. Its not worth getting when you die way way more than you kill.
1608	0	a	3/10 Sucks. Joined a lobby, I had no way of knowing that it was hacked until a mod menu popped up. It put me to lvl 70 and unlocked everything. This ruined the game. I have never experienced a hacker before today.
1609	0	a	wtf i whas using a mod but it say's i cheated wtf steam unban me now
1610	0	a	since modern warfare 3 got released the servers will prolly be empty and I mean EMPTY. don't buy
1611	0	a	No players, so you can't play this any more.
1612	0	a	It's just another COD, mainly designed around multiplayer which is pretty much dead by now. It's not impressive in any respect, just a shooter like so many others.
1613	0	a	Dont remeber playing this... I will probably never play this game again.
1614	0	a	To many hackers
1615	0	a	it was a meg alright game not one for fps
1616	0	a	You'll get into a lobby with some kids who has mods and he'll get you to level 70 and unlock everything for you. (literally) Next thing you know you're VAC banned, and it's permanent. Fine, fine. Call them up and tell them it's a mistake. Get into a lobby like that again? VAC banned.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, too many modders who â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you over. It's not like the servers aren't already drier than Britney Spears' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Waste of $20
1617	0	a	Only Team-Deathmatch mode works... !! Why other are not working? The game tries to connect but doesn't join any game!
1618	0	a	Got VAC banned for joining a friends game. Can't ever play again.
1619	0	a	do not use it on mac when you download it goes to a black screen
1620	0	a	i bought the game not from steam but from walmart it said it cant run on my 64 bit but thats what i own its slow and lags 
1621	0	a	-No lifes COD -Gets into Modded Lobby -Gets Vac banned  -Comes back 1,884 days later to write review  - 1/10 would not play again
1622	0	a	its multiplayer lets hackers in and i dont like some of its maps
1623	0	a	I love the game and played endless hours on my XBOX 360 and then on PC... until I got VAC banned for a modder leveling everyone up without choice in a TDM lobby to get the banned. Otherwise i'd give it 10/10.
1624	0	a	If you're this late into buying this game, you should've bought it while it was still gold; too many hackers in games, just spinbotting with snipers. This game is still great and all, but tbh, it's just dead now and not worth your money. Just save for a sale on this game or buy another game. Buy Zero G Arena maybe.
1625	0	a	just bouight this game last week for $20.00 . Story mode is awesome and whatnot but if you are looking for online competition, this game is the worst. No one is really online and when you find a server, it is supper laggy or a host is switching like every 3 minutes
1626	0	a	Cheater war....game not supported anymore... RIP COD!
1627	0	a	This would still be a awsome game if it wasn't for the wall hacks that are still going on here
1628	0	a	I had tons of fun with this game at one point, as you can probably tell by my hours played in Multiplayer. There's no denying it's quite a fun game, well, was a fun game.   In it's current state (referring to the online) it isn't worth buying. There aren't as many people playing anymore, and you'll probably get caught up in the same two or three lobbies, half of which are modded.   By the off chance you land yourself in a fresh lobby with no hackers, then you'll still have to deal with an FOV locked at 65, which for many people is just absurd. (You can find a third party launcher than changes the FOV without getting banned by IW, that's what I used for a while).   At one point this game was teeming with competative, fair players. It used to be one of the only COD games, besides CoD4, with a decent community. Unfortunately, the game now houses boatloads of hackers, modded lobbies, and little incentive to keep playing.  Anyway, great game if you have the patience to ignore these major flaws, but I cannot recommend it anymore in it's current state.
1629	0	a	I am upset with this game because of the matchmaking system. It automatically searches for players in your area, and since there was not many i couldn't hardly get into a game, so me and my 2 other friends would just play private matches. However you cannot level up doing this and 1 of my friends was the highest level so he had all the guns me and my other friend didn't have. This felt unfair since we couldn't level up, therefore we decided to download some hacks just so we could actually level ourselves up quickly. We didn't hack agaist other players so we didn't ruin anyone else's experience, we just wanted to be able to enjoy the game that we payed for. However, we ended up getting VAC banned for this. I do not believe this was a fair ban but whatever. Now I can no longer even play the game. What garbage.
1630	0	a	If I had a Billion, yes a billion dollars and paid a dollar everytime I got noobtubed in this game I would have no money, because I broke my PC so many times of raging and bought a new one
1631	0	a	Nostaligia is nice, but playing this in 2015 is worse than it was in 2010. Apparently the people that still play this have been using those 5 years to learn how to be the best camper that has ever camped.

When they wins, because they will always win, because you are doing 23-0 and they tube you accross the map, they write things kinda 'Ez, you noobs' or 'Frank da TANK rekts you'. I've played this on competitive side, CTS and networks like this on console so many years ago, and now I think I'm leaving this game because of this rage problems that simply win agains the whole game. This game is DEAD, or better, it is left to die.  In January 2016, I don't recommend this anymore.

The problem is that coop doesnt work on combination PC - MAC and when I play campaign it stucks on Mission 8 (Mac) making it impossible to complete. Terrible MAC support, so I advise other people not to purchase the game.
1712	0	a	This game is the reflection of the human condition. We all know hoe it is, and even though the are many things that could be easily improved for the benefit of the most, the few who can don't bother to do a single step. All they care is money. Exactly as mankind.  Would be difficult to change the teamcolors in order to help daltonics? Would be difficult to fix the server instability? Would be difficult to improve the chat menu? Would be difficult to allow mods and add ons since most of kids cheat anyway?  The fact that this game still costs 20 buck is the proof that money is all what they seek. The only reason worth playing this game are the maps, which are quite good, and the men is simple, but there are far better and cheaper games out there.
1713	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway

1720	0	a	Definitely one of the better Call of Duty singleplayer stories out there. It will definitely keep you entertained for the duration of its' mostly four hour campaign.  BUT  Multiplayer doesn't work on Mac. It just...crashed...or goes int oa black screen only restarting your computer can remove. Definitely broken in the multiplayer aspect.
1721	0	a	Just don't buy this game,its a waste of money,i am really sorry i bought it just because of the hackers and i lost all my attachements on a server and a hacker dominated the server,i watched the killcam and he was using aimbot:( i am really sorry for this game,it was the best game i had played but it doesn't worth the money,i would take my money back if i can!
1722	0	a	The game is good and all, but there are so many hackers it wrecks it. A couple of times I've joined a server and they are hacked servers where I get forced up to level 70 and finishes all the challenges. So for the hackers I can't recommend this game but the campaign is fun.
1723	0	a	The single player story is awesome. It picked up where Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare left off. With the 2-player co-op mode, you get to play with your friend to complete missions. Multiplayer contains more choice of killstreak. From remote-controlled missile to 10-second nuclear strike, multiplayer has been more fun than the previous game.  The multiplayer, however, isn't that great. It has poor matchmaking system and also doesn't have a game browser. The lag can be quite troublesome. The ping is stated as bars instead of approximate number. Hackers is the biggest problem of all. They can unlock every killstreaks, challenges, weapons, and attachments for you. This is a problem in the future gaming community because it will just lose players and Infinity Ward may stop supporting the multiplayer game in the future.  I rated this as negative because the multiplayer which is what making the game fun is badly implemented. It would be more stable if there are dedicated servers for rent to continue the fun match while maintaining a good connection quality.
1724	0	a	Excellent game love it. But was only able to play this game a short while then was banned by VAC for no reason. When i asked steam why they said that VAC detected a cheat. I have never cheated in a game and mill kill to death ratio in this game should back up my story but steam thinks that their VAC program is perfect and this does not happen, so who am to defend myself against a company who is in complete contol of your games. So its no use me trying to defend my case. Its a great game otherwise, and i hope that no-one else has had the same trouble i had. I have heard of this happening to others and they had their ban lifted, but why hasnt mine, especially if this is the only game in my list that has a VAC ban on it. Makes sense doesnt!? Godd luck to anyone else who own this.
1725	0	a	Terrible. The story line is weak and short. Multiplayer? LOL Yeah the biggest fail ever. NO dedicated servers, NO kicking/banning, NO choice in what map you play or any other options OTHER then gametype, NO leaning, unbalanced weapons/perks/killstreaks, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ respawns on overly busy map designs that leads to always being shot in the back by someone respawning or being killed by a camper, cheaters run rampant and are blatant because there is NOTHING you can do about them. Oh maybe VAC will detect the PUBLIC hacks, and ban them a few weeks later...maybe. It just keeps being worse. Lack of a console to tweak settings or even to display your frames per second!!!! Laggy as f*ck, as expected with no dedicated servers. Also what would appear to me, having their employees or simply people they pay to blatantly lie saying how good the game is. All of this for $10 more then PC games go for.....what a rip off.
1726	0	a	91 FPS cap and no ability to unlock via console like Black Ops. This game should be running at 200 FPS no problem. Why bother putting a 120hz graphics setting if you're going to cap at 91?
1727	0	a	alot of people cheat from lvl 1 to 70 (i have and i gave alot of videos and screenshots to steam and VAC but they don't care) and they ban who they want........
1728	0	a	single play is only thing thats good mutiplayer is full of hackers there are no dedicated servers ,i rather play Call of duty 4 !!!
1729	0	a	This game had its glory days, but now the game might aswell be dead.  Currently everyone playing is sup3rl33t360MLGv1rg1nzzxxx, or you enter a hacked lobby and your rank is gone.  
1730	0	a	nothing has changed
1731	0	a	After CoD 4, 5 the best part from this series, but only if you using 4d1 with dedicated servers, if you play with the lobby system good luck to find one which isnt full of hackers or complete morons beside the fact that every steam lobby lags.
1732	0	a	Call of duty: Hacker warfare XDDDD
1733	0	a	Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoD MW2) is the game that ruined Call of Duty Franchise.   Let's start with singleplayer. Singleplayer and escpecially Co-op missions were still somewhat ok, but singleplayer also had many things that I didn't like. First of all the singleplayer was filled with too many cutscenes. At least I play games to play them and not to watch movies. Of course the plot is important, but too much of cutscenes is just too much.   Another problem was that the plot was just too ridiculous. This is connected in many ways with with the third problem. The thing that I really liked in previous Call of Duty games and especially in the first Call of Duty game was the feeling of fighting with other soldiers (unlike in most early FPS games, in which you are a lone wolf) or how it was said in the cover of the manual of the very first Call of Duty game: 'No one fights alone'. This no longer applies in CoD MW 2 and the games following it. In CoD MW 2 you no longer fight with large group of fellow soldiers. Instead you fight alone or with only a couple of guys at most.  Now to multiplayer, which was the real disappointment. In the first Call of Duty game the maps were larger and more open but for some ridiculous reason the maps kept getting smaller and had more and more bottle necks as the series progressed. I could somehow cope with that until this game and i might have coped with it still if it had been the only problem, but it wasn't. The main problem that I have with this game are its ridiculous killstreak rewards and killstreak requirements. In CoD 4 the killstreaks were still somewhat acceptable, but CoD MW2 is no longer an FPS game. It is a game of killstreaks rewards. That is just not fun. The CoD games after this one have continued the usage of ridiculous killstreak rewards and because of this I will probably never again buy Call of Duty games. (To be honest, I predicted that this game was going to be horrible, and as a result I didn't buy this game, but instead got it as a gift.) Multiplayer part of MW 2 also suffers from decision to not to have dedicated servers.  Grade for Singleplayer: 6/10 Grade for Multiplayer: 2/10  Edited 26 Nov ember 10:29 to correct annoying typo. Edited to change 'the maps were large and open' to the maps were larger and more open' Edited 14 January 23:26 to fix a minor typo. Edited 18 February 21:03 Lack of dedicated servers added.
1734	0	a	One of the worst call of duty games I've played.
1735	0	a	This is the game that I got VAC banned from. Don't buy it. Everyone hacks in it. Not one single legit lobby I can get it.
1736	0	a	Game will not start and im very mad i Paid 20 bucks for this game an i want it to work !!!
1737	0	a	A disappointing sequel to one of the most solid FPS games of the late 2000s.  Released with no mod tools, dedicated servers or custom maps. To many, the hallmark event that turned the once-great PC FPS gaming into a consolized mess, something from which it has never recovered.
1738	0	a	This game got me a VAC ban on another account. The ban was wrongly placed; this was admitted by Steam and I got TF2 for it as compensation. The VAC ban is still visible though...  The game is not worth the money; The original MW is better...
1739	0	a	Game will not start and im very mad i Paid 20 bucks for this game an i want it to work !!!
1740	0	a	Like licking dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off the pavement.
1741	0	a	WARNING!!! If you join a XP Lobby, you will be VAC banned according to many people. The game is pretty good though.
1742	0	a	Worst game IÂ´ve ever palyed, RIP 25â‚¬
1743	0	a	-Trys using a zombies mod  -coverts Disc Vertion level over  -gets vac banned for both
1744	0	a	If you get a black screen, request a refund.
1745	0	a	Buy it for SINGLE PLAYER! Online is full of hackers and not even worth trying. Even the hackers are bad because online this game is stupidly easy to kill people, I'll end up being the top 3 frags.  It's a good game on its own though, just don't do it for multiplayer because it wont happen.
1746	0	a	Grr.  Ok, functionally this game is excellent. Lots of guns to shoot and lots of things to shoot at. However, the improvements made to these areas come at the price of the story and variety that CoD4 had. The result is a cheesy 'cold war goes hot' story where the Ruskies invade America that is just not very well done (if you want a good story in that setting, go check out the game World in Conflict). And while there is some of the sneaky funtimes of CoD4 that balanced that game against the intense firefights, this game is almost entirely big firefights. Make up a list of every thing you would expect to see in your typical hollywood action movie, and chances are quite alot of what's on that list is somewhere in this game. This is the sequel CoD4 got, but not the one it deserved.  Oh yeah, and multiplayer's here too. I actually did try that out in this game a bit, but after a while I stopped due to a mix of being terrible at its high-pace and annoyance at having few to no chances to try out the Spec Ops co-op missions which were actually kinda cool.  If the only thing that means anything to you is shooting guns in games and explosions, then you can have fun here. But if you like story to go with it, then this game will dissapoint.
1747	0	a	Im sorry to say that this whole franchise died after CoD4:ModernWarfare. That edition was as classic as CounterStrike.  Yet they wanted to milk their gamers further.. and further.. and further and here we are 2013 around 6 games later..   No soul left in these games anymore.
1748	0	a	MW2 multiplayer is filled with hackers. No dedicated servers make it even harder to find a game.
1749	0	a	game is trash. i got banned for joining a lobby where someone gave me 10th.
1750	0	a	Most people play it for multiplayer, but now it's full of hackers, so MW2 is kill.
1751	0	a	8/8 would not play agian
1752	0	a	Fantastic game, but all but died off because of the poor support by activision's VAC program that is woefully inadiquate at monitoring cheat hacking. Cheat hacking iswhat ruins the game forregular players looking to gain skills.
1753	0	a	I had my computer up side down
1754	0	a	was good at one point, not anymore
1755	0	a	MP review only: MW2 multiplayer [now] is a perfect sanctuary for mentally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ trolls. This acid cheating community is a wrong turn for those still sane.

1756	0	a	  I played for nearly 2 days i encountered my first hacker He gave everyone fly hacks He continued to report everyone but himself for hacking Valve vac banned everyone on there but the hacker Hacker screwed us over I get vacced 10/10 would get vac banned again
1757	0	a	This used to be a great game but now it got old. Multiplayer is dead-empty, and even if you manage to connect to a full-populated match, 20% of players are cheaters or noobsters with G18 akimbo.  In short, dont buy this. Used to be a good game but it's worthless now.
1758	0	a	one of the worst Military games I ahve played in Multiplayer, the single player is allt hat is worth playing. Internet play is as loggy as they come and there is no Dedicated server, so you are relying on a Host that is probably infested with Spyware from the Giant Google Partners. Stay away from this POS game, because you knwo after you get threw single player your stick with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Stick to Modern WarFare it's better, and So that you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ers know, CoD is on the Death Bed, and the Development teams are considerign the Suspenion of future releases. Right now there isn't a version planned for next year (At the Time of this Review)
1759	0	a	This game is bad. Very bad. All my pretentious friends told me so, all my normal friends told me so, but with a metacritic score of 86, how bad could it be? I thought while ominous music played in the background.  Pros: - spunkgargleweewee if you're into that sort of thing - burly white dudes kill other people with large guns that have military sounding names  Cons: - frustrating - levels feel all the same - the person you're following always moves too slow - F***ING GRENADES EVERYWHERE WHAT THE F**K!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - is everyone in this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? - will make you question why you haven't stopped playing yet  That said, it's got good multiplayer.
1760	0	a	The most unrealistic, immature, stupid, over rated, stupid game i have ever played in my lifetime.  2/10 peas in a pod.  p.s. if ur looking for a rather GOOD game, stick with csgo. &lt; rated 10 islams / 10
1761	0	a	The prize for it is too high, and in multiplayer is mutch cheaters and hack modes. Don 't buy this.
1762	0	a	worst game ever steam remove this broken game
1763	0	a	Back then I had no life.... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. 9/11 would bomb again.
1764	0	a	Enabled VAC again, no players online. **** THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!     
1765	0	a	Does not have conroller compatibilty
1766	0	a	No offline LAN, no mods, no command console, the campaign is decent but the muliplayer is a copy paste clone of call of duty 4: modern warfare with fewer players allowed per server, no server browser, just terrible matchmaking that doesn't even work correctly anymore. It's basically a console port. Buy Call of duty 4 Modern Warfare instead as it is actually future proof...
1767	0	a	Not balanced for lean.
1768	0	a	This game is full of wanna-be hardscopers, 0/10 ***
1769	0	a	Don't buy this game, it is filled with hackers and is just not fun to play anymore. Get it on Xbox360 or PS3 to have a hacker free experience.
1770	0	a	Alright folks this game's over ! Servers are now hacked or they are just down. RIP MW2
1771	0	a	The worst bug i've ever encountered! Exodus: the laser sensor locks out after you die once making the game impossible to complete as you need that same key to finish the level (changing controls doesn't help either). It is a great game and I have played it on consoles for years, just disappointed about this glitch that wont likely be fixed since it is such an old game now.
1772	0	a	What can I say about Call of DutyÂ®: Modern WarfareÂ® 2.   Whenever I think of MW2, I think of bliss, I think of flying through the clouds without a care in the world, talking to our lord and saviour jesus. This immense feeling of paradise can only be achieved after playing MW2. Soon afterwards, people will try and stop your progress to Utopia. This stage is called chemotherapy. Ignore them and continue on your fast track to heaven, because after playing this game you will immediatley begin to die of cancer.   The amount of cheaters is absolutley ridiculous, it outnumbers the cheaters in CSGO by 300:1, and that is saying something. It would be okay if they at least tried to hide it because at least then I can try and believe that they are better than me. MW2, a game where its weird if you dont encounter mulitple hackers.   More importantly than this, the amount of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s on this game is even more obscene. Who opens up a game and thinks 'How can I be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rat today?'. If I had a pound for every time I have been noob tubed, I could stack them all up, climb up and be the first man to walk on Mars. The amount of tryhards overwhelm all my emotions. I normally miss the final kill cam of every game because im curled up on the floor, sucking my thumb and rocking myself to sleep.   Finally, can we get chat disabled? Its either that or castrate every single person that says 'GG' after a TDM. Who the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do you think you are? Its a DM, not ESL One Cologne you braindead â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥head.   In conclusion, this game isnt the worst game ever, but there are some points (highlighted above) that could be improved.
1773	0	a	I wish I could rate the online mode some where in the middle because I do have fun from time to time. Unfortunately, I can only recommend a Yes or No. While single player is pretty good, the online experience is extremely tainted with hackers and aimbotters. The worst part is that I do not believe anything is really being done about it. I will admit that I have had fun playing online. But this really only happens if I am able to get enough friends together to start a party. To sum it up, if you plan on playing online, expect this: You will continuously be shot through walls by aimbotters, ruthlessly tracked down by wallhackers, rude players, the occasional dDos from poor sports that can shut your net down for a bit, and you will quickly discover how sexually active your mother actually is (likely within the very first match).
1774	0	a	I downloded the game 4 times and restarted it 7 and I still cant play the damn game I expected more from Call of duty I will not recommend this game to anyone.

1776	0	a	Lost all my game data have random classes made, lost all my perks steam what is going on!!!!!
1777	0	a	got shot by probably 50 bullets in 1 mission and regen health in like 15 seconds 0/10 worst game ever
1778	0	a	i have not played this one for i was always a fan of world at war and black ops. but this one was said to be the best before the third game. well truth is i can tell it used to be but not now. this game is infected with hackers, aimbots, map hackers, speed hackers, you name it and you can find it. oh did i mention that out of the constant 300+ people there most of them are hackers? ya see i can tell this cause of the severe landslide of 10th prestige level 70 players with prestige emblems/rank emblems you cant get unless you mod or hack or have a hacker give to you. i was level 24 when this happened but i joined a server via random matchmaking que and it put me in a server that was really laggy. then after about a minute a player on the console with a rainbow colored name said ' everyone gets level 70 ' then a loading bar popped up on my screen that looked like it was a campaign hud overlay for a mission done in campaign counting percents. well in my console it was telling me all my challenges were being completed one by one and one after another. i tried to leave the server but it had been too late. the hacker had made my once FAIR level 24 profile a level 70 profile with hacked emblems titles and such. being really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off as i was i refused to play for a day then said 'might as well just try to enjoy the game' well among servers like that and other exploits i was also thrown into countless matches where people were running mods such as changing the team names of navy seals and the spetsnaz to 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' and 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'s' as well as turning off everyones loadouts killstreaks knife button aim button and replaced grenades with throwing knives and forced to no scope with a intervention. then there was another server where one such hacker was calling every single kill streak reward in the game all at once within the first ten seconds of the match. another server i joined changed the map half way through. and to further prove my point. there is a server that someone is running labeled as a team death match server but its a team domination server. the host of such server is running a aimbot with a 50 cal and every time he takes a shot every lags. as well as he has turned off various loudouts and changed what is in them. i dont think this game is bad persay. but it is infested with hackers and Infinity ward and Valve's VAC service that is supposed to maintain the game is doing absolutly nothing about such problems. i would say get this game because its a good game in the series but unfortunately i wouldnt even look in its general direction unless its playing privately with a friend or two. ( if anyone will play it due to call of duty's reputation. i for one have only few people i know who play it on my friends list cause of the fad of people saying cod sucks cause it sucks nonsense) if anyone were to get this game i implore you to not even touch the multiplayer functions unless playing privitely with a friend. other than that this game is dead because of infinity wards abandonment of it as well as the VAC service being proved to be really useless in it. RIP Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. we knew you well.
1779	0	a	(mulitplayer) Either you join a lobby full of hackers who lower your scores, and reset everything you've done, call in a nuke with 2 kills ect. Or you join a lobby full of campers, I'm talking hardcore sitting in the corner with an rpd silenced.... I even caught 2 people boosting once !!! and there's very few lobbies to join as nobody plays it anymore, you'll leave to find a new one, straight back in, I do not recommend you buy this if you're looking for some nostalgia, buy an xb360 and get it on there if you must, but not pc.
1780	0	a	The game in which the COD-series began to get worse, although I liked the single player campaign very much. The multiplayer section I really cannot recommend, due to the too hectic nature of the online experience. Everybody just runs around with multiple badass weapons and a loadout of superhuman perks. Just like the wet dream of an 8-year-old. On top of that we see the gunship who comes in when a camper gets a killstreak, and who seems to be able to kill dozens of enemies in or out cover, does not matter whatsoever. BANGBANGBANG I defenately would like that back in the days when I was 8. No sorry this is not modern warfare but a disguised version of DUKE NUKEM
1781	0	a	Its a Good GAME but i get banned from 'Hacking' Aparently playing with Self Texture is hacking yet i didnt even play Multiplayer Online. Best Reinstalling Game ever. And WAY to many hackers online *gets game goes online gets rank 70.'
1782	0	a	Was fun game, until I got VAC banned...
1783	0	a	decent fun, cod 4 is better tho
1784	0	a	i bought it and played it. only thing is saw in the multiplayer was explosions. i had no idea where people are, only thing is saw is explisons and death, it was like a movie from michael bay
1785	0	a	Would be nice if it actually launched consistently on Win 10
1786	0	a	Can't even ragequit.  Edit: Got the retail version so this won't count in the statistics. Just me letting of some STEAM here.
1787	0	a	mulitplayer guarantees a strict nat. prepare for lag fest. nothing you can do not even port forwarding or dmz no support from IW either
1788	0	a	 (This review is for the multiplaye because thats all I ever played)
1789	0	a	I would of recommended this game if it weren't for the fact that almost 99% of players cheat and I decided to jump on the large bandwagon and do the same thing! NOW LOOK WHERE IT ENDED ME UP IN! I'M IN A PERMANENT VACATION AND CAN'T DEPART! Anyways... if your going to buy this game I stongly suggest to play singleplayer and avoid multiplayer at all costs (unless your playing with a friend) so you won't rage quit every match you join and keep getting headshotted by the same player 50+ and smash your keyboard.

1797	0	a	CoD Modern Warfare 2 is possibly the best call of duty game ever developed. But that completely meaningless. All CoD games I have ever played have been unbalanced, felt horrible and imprecise, not been fun in the multiplayer at all, and not even had decent graphics. Don't consider getting this, unless you have horrible parents and can get nostalgia from it because they bought you an 18 when you were 4 or 5.
1798	0	a	Short version: Ok singleplayer for $10. Not recommending cos the normal tag is (at least in AUS) $40 USD. Play time 8hrs 40min on Veteran (frist run)  Long version: Standard shooter. Still not as good as original COD. Stole a lot of it's missions from the original  (e.g. Reichstadt, Stalingrad). Gunning down civilians was a plus.  The difficulty of enemies is lame, brought on by implementing a simple AI that autoaims/wallhacks, funneled scripted moments, and overwhelming number of enemies. Nothing tactical or strategic required.  Weird autosave spots, like right in the middle of a firefight. Then not one for 5 minutes. Visual cues when and where you are getting hit from are poor. Screen shakes a lot for no reason (getting hit, heavy vehicle) Garbage stealth level where you kill one guy silently and suddenyl everyone knows. Unless if your sniper buddy kills him, then that's ok. Spawns enemies right on top of you, in corners where you know there were no enemies.  Can't tell who are the enemy, yet get a game over screen for shooting your buddies No continuity between one level and the next.  Some nice level design - felt that although scenarios were repeated ad infinitum - some of those levels lacked character, while others were detailed. Only allowed to complete everything one way (with a handful out of thousands of potential choices, with zero consequence).  Hold button until it dies works in 95% of cases Your allies do next to nothing unless explicitly scrtiped to do so... might as well be Star Wars Stormtroopers.  I feel there was a much better story here that someone sold out just to get it published. There were heaps of tiny details that were present just not utilised. Pity.

1805	0	a	The last Call of Duty that has been okey.  But since last year there is alot of hackers and trollers thats why i say NO!
1806	0	a	This is the herald of the end of good CoD games. The game that signaled the fall into a game series that more than anything are a parody of themselves. The final nail in the coffin was its successor, the game-turned-actionmovie MW3.
1807	0	a	CoD Modern Warfare 2 is possibly the best call of duty game ever developed. But that completely meaningless. All CoD games I have ever played have been unbalanced, felt horrible and imprecise, not been fun in the multiplayer at all, and not even had decent graphics. Don't consider getting this, unless you have horrible parents and can get nostalgia from it because they bought you an 18 when you were 4 or 5.

1813	0	a	Before u buy this game make sure ur laptop/desktop is in perfect condition and up to date because this game is so laggy i could barely move the corner without getting killed by hackers. Also single player is even laggier but works fine.
1814	0	a	I really like the game. I hate the fact that I have to deal with Steam just to play the damn thing when I want. I just wanted to play real quick for a few minutes because I haven't played in a few months. I can't because I have to wait 11 freaking hours for the game to update! Really?! I didn't want to play online or anything multiplayer, just a couple minutes in the privacy of my own home. Just because my game didn't have the latest updates was not going to take away any enjoyment for the hour or so I had available to play! I have had it with this crap! I have most of the call of duty games and all of the modern warefare games. I am going to get rid of them all in a yard sale this spring and as God is my witness from now on any game that has anything to do with steam is not coming in my house! I don't care if it's the best damn game ever made and the characters crap gold nuggets onto my desk! Thanks Steam for ruining these games for me and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off today!
1815	0	a	Game was good in 2010, trash now. This game is so flooded with cheaters you'd be surprised to see a game w/out them, also, there's virtually no punishment for it, only a few get VAC'd, and reporting them does nothing. Not to mention the fact that there are certain guns that destroy everything else (Scar, ACR, Ak, Raffica, etc). There are certain killstreaks that are cleary better than other when it comes to effectiveness (Predator, Harrier, Pave Low, Chopper Gunner/AC-130). The tick rate + netcode are awful (you'll get killed around corners more often than not, when you see someone all you have to do is just shoot because if they try and hide you'll still kill them).  Stay away, game is good (kind of), community is more toxic than Chernobyl (Old COD fans would understand).

1821	0	a	 (This review is for the multiplaye because thats all I ever played)
1822	0	a	I would of recommended this game if it weren't for the fact that almost 99% of players cheat and I decided to jump on the large bandwagon and do the same thing! NOW LOOK WHERE IT ENDED ME UP IN! I'M IN A PERMANENT VACATION AND CAN'T DEPART! Anyways... if your going to buy this game I stongly suggest to play singleplayer and avoid multiplayer at all costs (unless your playing with a friend) so you won't rage quit every match you join and keep getting headshotted by the same player 50+ and smash your keyboard.
1823	0	a	In most multiplayer games, kids like to adapt what I call the 'naiive driver' attitude, where cars going faster/driving more aggressive than you are crazy, reckless, cop magnets. while cars going slower/driving more passively than you are obviously in no hurry to get anywhere, they must be senior citizens in the driver seat and well the world would be better off without them.  This game is absolutely ridden with children like these. I consider myself a pretty good player (I get some ridiculous KDRs...) but as always, those who are better than you MUST be hacking. Those who are worse than you are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing noobs and need to learn how to play.  In addition to the community complaints, I have a bone to pick with those who consistently use the most overpowered or trolling weapons. People like to justify this with 'its in the game', but this fallacy is overturned when they realize that metaknight is in super smash bros brawl, the moon breaker laser was in Golden Eye, and the 1-hit-KO hadouken upgrade was in megaman X. Just because the programmers of the game wanted to make a few guns easier to use and overall better than others doesn't mean they meant for the grenade launchers and akimbo glocks to be abused all the damn time. Yes they're programmed into the game and if you buy it you'll have to deal with it.  Pros: I liked the single player campaign it was fun. Spec ops are fun too. Cons: Community in multiplayer blows, hackers run amok â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing with lobbies and your customized classes and whatnot, some children will whine and cry while others will troll the hell out of u with cheap strategies and annoying classes.  Don't get this game I still play it because I'm good enough to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with everyone. That's about it.

1828	0	a	Hello! Just wanna say this: This game sucks! Don't download it its sucks! 
1829	0	a	Its Ok but 2many hackers
1830	0	a	Wont open or run, what gives....
1831	0	a	A lot like CoD4.   The campaign is fine, but the multiplayer has hackers, which ruins the game. The multiplayer maps you start out with make poor use of space, and unlike in CoD4, where small maps had room for all ranges of weapons, pretty much everyone in MW2 uses medium range weapons. So less diversity, still hackers, but the game doesn't have all the mods that made CoD4 interesting, plus no admins.  Just not worth it.
1832	0	a	It's decent game. I'm still downvoting it, because I think it's unreasonable that they would release a patch that would stop the cheat codes from working in a game that still has some serious flaws. It's the same with MW2, and probably with World at War, too.
1833	0	a	1 of the worst game that i have ever seen. So boring, primitive, unlogical. I am talking not only about mw2, but about all game series from CoD4 to ghosts. For example, weapons. It seems that weapons' characteristics were written under tonns of drugs. .50 cal barret has similar damage to 7.62x51 M21 rifle. USP .45 has same damage to 9mm beretta ( 9x19 vs 11.43x25 ). Tavor-21 ( 5.56x45 ), AK ( 7.62x39 ) and SCAR-h (7.62x51) have SAME damage. .50 AE desert eagle has same damage to .44 revolver. WHY every CoD has WA2000 rifle??? only 200 rifles were made and nobody use it. HEY TREYARC! just google ' sniper rifle ' - you will find a lot of sniper rifles which is much better than experimental WA2000. About scenarious - yeah, bad russians and good americans save the world - very fashionable story. Nothing original, nothing interesting - just always make the same. About BO - this is the worst CoD even made. Its just epic fail. 90% of all weapons are FROM FUTURE. Game about 1960's and it has AK74, WA2000 from 1980's (!!!), GP25 and a lot of other things. Of course scenarios are the worst - tell how bad russians used nazi scientists and put heroes of ww2 into the prison. And it doesnt matter that IRL situation was clearly the opposite - americans used nazi scientists. Gameplay is the most primitive, unlogical, unrealistic and boring. All gameplay in 2 words - run n gun. Even Counter-strike is more logical, realistic and interesting than this. Freaking health regeneration - after .50 in stomach just wait several seconds and you are OK.  http://huh.by/uploads/posts/2012-06/1340985650_call-of-duty-vkratce.gif  - about melee fight. And about Ghosts.. dear treyarc, what do you call ' nextgen '? I have never seen so bad graphics, even RO1 and CS:S have better graphics than 'ghosts'. Gameplay is just 100% copypast from other CoDs, this game is still the same as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, IT IS ABSOLUTELY 100% SAME GAMEPLAY - NOTHING CHANGED.   I think that treyarc just uses the brand, sucks money from blind people. I really wonder that someone still plays it and love it.  The only 1 CoD which i like - is the first CoD. This is the only 1 CoD where you dont have health regen, here you have 100 hp. Yea, its quite unrealistic too, but it is more realistic than auto regen after any wound. Only in first CoD you can place your weapon bi pod. Only in first CoD you can use vehicle NORMALLY, WITHOUT ANY STUPID LAPTOPS.

1836	0	a	The game is fun. Unremarkable and short singleplayer. Fun, but mostly abandoned multiplayer. The multiplayer community is split across a number of map packs. The game still costs a lot because activision is seemingly unwilling to discount it to a reasonable amount.  I would only recommend this game at $5.  I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.

1838	0	a	Look this is a great game, fantastic. But You can not play Spec ops with friends, and also can't join your friends in multiplayer. I bought this game for the spec ops, and the spec ops alone, and i'm afraid other people might too. DO NOT BUY GAME FOR SPEC OPS, DOES NOT WORK!!!!
1839	0	a	The classic (and problematic) mechanics of Call of Duty of 'spawn an infinite number of enemies until you go to this waypoint' are in full effect here. In a game that gives you limited health, limited ammo, and unlimited enemies, it very much forces you into a style of gameplay that may not be one that you actually enjoy.
1840	0	a	TOOOOO DAMN MANY HACKERS ( not showing off but i reached to a point that i played with no map just because i was getting my map hacked like 4 times a day and its realy frustrating repairing all the time your files and i was able to nuke many times ) but after a year the hackers just went off the charts totaly insane hacking on every game you could possiby search and as you entered theyr loby your prestiges reset to 1 and maany other frustrating tricks they got :) Plus totaly Removing Favela without fixing its issues with the whole insulting matter that went on with the toilet and the arab scribings on the portraits i personaly payed for this game and i would like the whole package that i payed of if you get my point cus Favela is still out of the search lists....u just got to set up your own game there and lets face it this game is to enter it and kill some people ( see the perks like comando = fast and slash not w8 for every1 to log on make the party and all that u just want to go online join search find game and PLAY the game not setting up the whole grid for a decent favela....

1847	0	a	There was an era when people gathered and lan partied. Then the time came, when you Owed to have Internet connection and services such as those steam provides, in order to play multi. Then dedicated servers seized to exist and games such as this, ruined the fun, especially when match making doesn't find any players. If you like fps and especially COD , play everything until MW(2). Your location might depend on whether you will be able to find other players and from MW2 and on, the game is more esport friendly, meaning for ex. Totally random spawns etc...

1866	0	a	Used to be a pretty nice game, but not worth buying now as it does not work properly with Windows 7 or newer. Even in compatibility mode it freezes and crashes consistently in single player, so unless you enjoy playing the first few missions of the campaign until it freezes, crashes, and looses all your data and makes you start over, it's a pretty worthless game at this point.
1867	0	a	Hello, thanks for reading my review. Hope yall take it into consideration before you buy this game.  Will it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Your Computer: Yes. I'm not kidding. there are endless articles about it online. just go look up 'How to fix MW2.'  1. DO NOT PLAY MULTIPLAYER ON THIS GAME. it will break your computer. it gave me internet problems where i disconnected from my router yet my brothers laptop could connect 100% fine compared to mine. EVEN IF I WASNT PLAYING MW2, IT STILL RANDOMLY DISCONNECTS MY INTERNET FOR NO REASON, AT LEAST ONCE PER 25-30 MINUTES. i had to uninstally and reinstall my internet and ethernet drivers and it STILL did not completely fix the problem, even though it helped a bit.  2. it also broke my computers headset support so my headset that worked 100% perfectly fine before playing the game would not work at all. back to the internet problems, being in a skype or teamspeak call for too long while playing ANY game not just MW2 would also make me lose connection automatically after about a minute.  3. I EXPERIENCED NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE HAVING THIS GAME, AND EVEN AFTER UNINSTALLING IT, NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WERE FIXED. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  4. My brothers friend who is pretty good with Computers says my last alternative will be to freaking uninstall and reinstall windows 10 tomorrow and we will see if that will fix anything.  5. CAMPAIGN WORKS 100% FINE. BUT ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER ASPECT.  6. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. I loved loved loved the xbox version back in the day but i sold my xbox awhile back and wanted to play a little MW2 cause it was an amazing game, but all the issues with it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing with my computer. its such an unstable game holy shhhhittttt do not buy it. It will give your computer cancer.  7. its cheap as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (like 4.50$) on â™¥â™¥â™¥, which is a very trustworthy site, so thats a good cost if you ONLY want to play the Campaign. otherwise, do not get this game.  Rating: Gameplay: 4.5/5 Stability: 0/5 Campaign: 5/5 Will it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Your Computer: Yes. I'm not kidding. there are endless articles about it online. just go look up 'How to fix MW2.'

1875	0	a	I would like it if it werent for the fact that after every hour I play of it, it crashes and my computer wont turn on for a whole day, and when it finally does, its still in game, then I can get off it, and that why i HAVE 15 or 16 hours on the game and like no achievments, its because I cant play the damn game.. other than that good game...
1876	0	a	Aside from 'No russian' i found most of the game boring, repetitive and stupid. I'm not a xbox fratboy or 12 year old, so this game just doesn't appeal to me.

1882	0	a	Don't buy this game anymore, there are too many hackers on now.   Honestly the multiplayer is so broken, it's not at all perfect, but because everything is broken you end up having fun.
1883	0	a	Why is this game full of 15 year old dumb kids who don't even know what an education system is. This game on PC alone makes me want to sell my computer and buy an Xbox so I don't have to deal with dumb poor kids who buy alienware pre-built PC's and think they're insane.
1884	0	a	if aids could be contracted via video games, this game would be the main host for the disease. If youre thinking about playing this game in this day and age, save yourself from losing a few years of your life due to stress from noobtubers, knifers,, painkiller, and just plain â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ players. Pretty much anyone left playing this game is a huge â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who's main objective is to ruin other people's experiences of what could have been a great game. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something that causes enjoyment more than frustration.

1891	0	a	Amazing game for ret. ards! If you are a ret. ard, this game is just for you and doesn't require any skills to be a hero! Get yourself an unlimited sprint perk with a commando perk, which allows you to stab your enemies with your pocket knife for 5 meters distance! Spend your time on the run and stab mission! Not interested? No problem, you can just equip yourself with a M203 nooblauncher to get an easy and guaranteed kills every time you respawn! If this still isn't your style, we got another option: The dualwield autopistols! Take the Glock 18 to each hand and just run and spray it all over the map, you will get your free kills! Still not interested? Than you are most probably not a re. tard and the game isn't made for players like you.

1902	0	a	if u like to be noobtubed, spammed with over powered guns, and quickscoped and getting killed in every cheap way possible get this game. if u want a good game get battlefield
1903	0	a	'Jerry'
1904	0	a	This game does not support controllers and is NOT co-op. It reminds me of my ex-wife Betsy. Promising apsects, but in the end, one big pile of **** that doesn't put out.
1905	0	a	Very short game for single player. I am disappointed in the amount of playtime.
1906	0	a	Dont Buy The Game I Bought This Game Days Ago Ive Been Banned In Day For Being In A Hacked Lobby That I Didnt Know Was Hacked Im Still Kinda New To PC Gaming Because Ive Played Xbox For Years Now While On PC it May Say 2 Years But I Just Never Get On But Ive Been Banned For Pretty Much No Reason I Do Not Recommend This If Your Playing Mutiplayer Im Done With Steam Im Not Paying Anymore Money Found Out What A VAC Ban Was Because I Had No Idea What It Was Xbox And Playstation Is Better Go To Consle.
1907	0	a	the starting screen wont load so u basically spend 10 dollars to look at a black screen
1908	0	a	It sucks
1909	0	a	I've been banned from this game.. I don't own it. :D
1910	0	a	I honestly don't like this game because there is so much spawn camping, you die everytime you spawn in
1911	0	a	Very short game for single player. I am disappointed in the amount of playtime.
1912	0	a	I like this game but I can't recommand it on PC. This is the first ever COD console port. it took away leaning and mods. But no controller support and local splitscreen.   If you just want to play mp, go for it. Servers browser is still there.
1913	0	a	The worst Call of duty I have ever played 'In terms of the multiplayer' The noob tubes the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lag everything about this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. This is coming from a guy who put hundreads of hrs into MW1. The only redeeming quality of this game is the campaign
1914	0	a	The game that killed the CoD franchise for a lot of PC gamers... Laggy, full of hackers, no servers (p2p). This is Cancer of Dullsville: Men Whining 2.
1915	0	a	it sucks harder than ur mum
1916	0	a	IF YOU'RE IN AUS, THIS GAME IS RUN BY A PIGHEADED â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING ARAB â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WHO BANS ANYONE WITH A KD OF 1.0 OR HIGHER
1917	0	a	this would be a brilliant game, but it keeps freezing everytime I try to open it, and thus, I am unable to play. please fix this
1918	0	a	Cheaters + Noobtubers + Campers + Lagging = MW2
1919	0	a	the only thing thats gonna â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing happen is your gonna get noob tubed grenaded and broken â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hitboxes this game should die off
1920	0	a	WORST SHOOTER EVER. The amount of hacked servers, pathetic sounds, and broken controls make this game feel cheap. I would rather play combat arms then jump off a cliff then play this game.
1921	0	a	game would be better if it supported controllers. im terrible with mouse and keyboard
1922	0	a	Worst game series ever created, just terrible.
1923	0	a	In 2007, CoD:MW (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare) was released into a community that has a seemingly insatiable lust for more shooter action. They weren't just given another shooter, they were given a game that really pushed the genre considerably. Amazing single player campaign and adrenaline-pumped, fast-paced multiplayer action with perks and weapon sets set the new standard on how these FPS's are done. It left it's mark on gaming as a whole, so a sequel was inevitable and gamers couldn't wait. In fact - according to an eye-witness who works at my local Game Stop - MW2 '...became the best-selling game in history before it was even released', all being pre-orders (of course, #1 sellers are subject to change). Imagine their dissapointment when they got this...  Plot 1/10  ..was so convoluted, I can't tell you what it was. Everybody wants everybody dead except the protagonists, and the only solution is...killing everybody. It's a movie written by Michael Bay. That's all I have to say about the plot without spoiling it. If you don't care (which you shouldn't), highlight this big, black box.    You meet Soap in the third-person, but it's so akward and out of his character to hear him talk. Then when you get back to playing as him, he stops talking again. For the main character of the first game being linked into the second game, he's just so seemed; so tacked-on and uninteresting. All the characters from the last game are 'magically' back too, despite being shot in the back of the head with Desert Eagles. Captain Price is back, but his acting and dialogue couldn't be more out of character. He went from rough, clever, and a cold sense of humor, to this...My Little Pony....thing. He's overly polite with no backbone. Imagine Mufasa suddenly with the mentality of Patrick Star, and you're not far off. Further, everytime I hopped onto an escape vehicle, I knew someone was going to shoot me because it happens like 4 times. When General Shepard reveals himself as the bad guy, it wasn't exciting. It was met with a loud YAAAWN. The twist is where the game's story slips into a void like a balloon into a hurricane. The player also 'dies' too much. Not in gameplay, but more like a scripted event/cutscene thing. Once again, *yawn*. The only intriguing part is when the EMP wipes out most of America's power. You and your team navigate a deathly-silent ghost town. It's eerie and very realistic; the best part of the game.    The ending also plays out like every other cutscene in the game: 'Good job, now let's carry you off and tell you who the kill nex-' CREDITS; THAR'LL BE A SEEQUEL!  Graphics/Sound 8/10  I'll put these in the same category because I don't have much to say about them. MW2's sound and visuals are everything we expect from the series: excellent. The guns, the dust, the lighting, character models are all beautiful, and guns, tanks, explosions all sound great, too; so why an 8/10? Attentive gamers will notice that a majority of this game's voice cast is from Mass Effect. In fact, several things were just 'taken' from Mass Effect. For one thing, your CO's voice is the voice of Captain Anderson, and the voice of the general is the voice of Admiral Hackett. Oh, and the general's name? Sheperd. There's nothing wrong with being inspired, but I call this a lazy, rip off. Infinity Ward wasn't even trying. Maybe I'm just being picky, but this really rubbed me wrong despite Keith David's long career as voice actor for military-esque media.  Gameplay 5/10  Finally, gamers are starting to see the light with the release of CoD:Ghosts. It's the same. Darn. Game. Same rail-shooter scenes, same set pieces, same 'set bomb and run away' scene, same door breaching scene, same, same, same. We've been playing the same game since the original Call of Duty in 2003 and before that with the Medal of Honor series. It's been 11 years of the same game. It's time for CoD to die. You run forward, you kill the next thing that moves, and steadily march to the credit roll. Everything about it is so banal; boring to the point of painful. The graphics and sounds aren't enough to mask the bad gameplay and story. A pretty package doesn't make the bad contents good. You've played CoD before. Enough said.  Multiplayer also went downhill with unbalanced weapons and killstreak abilities that broke the game entirely. When you get 3 kills in one life, you get a UAV that reveals all enemies on the radar. However, these streak rewards stacked with one another, so you use the UAV to get a few more kills, and get a chopper. The chopper automatically gets you 5 more kills giving you an AC-130 gunship. Use THAT for a few more kills, you get a nuke that ends the game instantly. Sounds pretty ambitious on pen and paper, but in game it means: first to a 3 kill streak WINS. Hackers also had their way with the game and Infinity Ward/Treyarch/Activision or all three refused to do anything about it. I've heard rumors that the same hacks that worked on MW2 also worked on MW3 and Black Ops. Watching this trend, I believe it.   If you want an example of customer service done RIGHT, let's ask Valve. Some time ago, Steam was glitching up and improperly banning players from accessing MW2. Gabe Newell wrote a personal apology to these gamers, and offered them a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2). While that was generous and very polite, that might have been a bad idea for the poor people that play L4D2, because all the teenage @***holes from this game are now trolling the L4D2 community (as if that game wasn't bad enough.)  The Verdict  Visually, there's little to complain about. MW2 is very realistic by sight and by sound. Some of the settings are creepy with ash blotting out the sun and smoke rising from decimated vehicles and climbing corpses to escape combat. The whole world is going crazy, but they couldn't make the player care less. Traversing the beautiful world is an uphill hike to the credits. Yearly releases also means the community will be widely divided and chopped thinner and thinner with each release, so there's no point in trying to play MP. MW2 is big pass. Maybe get it for 5 bucks and beat it once. Final score: 3/10 Almost no reason to buy it.
1924	0	a	pls help my mouse dosent move when im in call of duty modern warfare 2 multiplayer main menu it dosent move HELP

1932	0	a	What a piece of crap. It seems almost everyone who recommends this game is 100% nostalgia blind. Firstly dont bother with the piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ storyline that is so dry you could snort it, lets talk about the multiplayer, which consists of: run into a room, shoot, repeat. 'Oh, you shot a bunch of people real good heres another rank (the equivilant of a gold sticker in kindergarden).
1933	0	a	DONT buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.  SINGLEPLAYER  the story absolutely makes no sense. its just about action.  MULITPLAYER is full of cheaters, last stand, martyr and aikombo noobs that just camp, bunny hopp or lay down while shooting.  if you get a connection you play a few maps and then the connection randomly interrupts again cause the privat server solution is crap.  the game is also full of rank hackers, wallhackers and other cheaters and annoying for people that have at least a bit skill.  its the WORST of all call of duty games. i never wasted my money sucessfully like for this epic fail game.
1934	0	a	I own a macintosh and I cannot hack 1/10.

1953	0	a	so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bad i can go play because ''steam must be running to play this game'' and i cant fix it â™¥â™¥â™¥ this!!! 
1954	0	a	Too many hackers, too many 'instant 70' servers, I really like the game, but at least playing the multiplayer on steam is not recommended at all.
1955	0	a	Yes, I loved this game it's awesome! It never gets damn boring! If you're so much into leveling as I am, you're gonna have much time spend on this game! BUT! Here's the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing thing! There's a important reason why I write this TODAY! I've bought this game like one or two months ago! I enoyed it a lot til this day. Because when I joined a match today I stumbled into a hacked lobby, which is actually nothing in usual in cod as you may know, you just gently exit it... But today, I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥IN GOT BANNED FOR JUST NOTHIN! It is just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in rediculous! I did not do one little rule breaking thing, and got punished for the 'crime' of another person! I even tried contacting the the staff, as adviced by steam... And this is what came out:    1 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 As I today started steam and thought about playing a bit Modern Warfare 2 Online, everything was fine. I logged into steam, started the game and finally went into an Team-Deathmatch game. Then i quickly realized, it was a hacked lobby. Since it was some kind of Snipers-Only match. I then turned around and went out again. Then the strange things started. Firstly my name was, for non me known reason, completely dark blue, as if I'd have set it up in my Steam name, those color combinations I mean, which I did not! I thought then 'it might maybe be just an bug...', so I just started to look for another match, another TDM one. But this time, when I'm entered, I immediately got kicked out and left with the message 'Cheat detected.'. I was just shocked! Because I did nothing wrong! I was not hacking at all! I just accidently joined such a lobby! I even asked, before leaving, who was hacking in there. A player with the name 'Progster', or something like that, responded. So I tried another time to play a match and the exact same thing happened. Until that point my name was still blue. I decided to restart the game and see, if it may goes back to the nnormal state. And so it was. My name then turned white (or orange in the menus I mean), but the ban still existed!  So my question is, if you may could reset the ban and instead punish the right perpetrator. I did really nothing wrong and I was so happy when I finally got the game. I just can't believe that I got really banned... All this happened like half an hour ago. So I beg again for resetting this somehow happened ban. This has already happened to me in the past, but I did not got banned for accidently joining an hacked lobby...  Thank you very much. - Message by our staff on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 If you have been VAC Banned, the ban will not be removed.  For more information, please refer to our FAQs:  https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4044-QDHJ-5691  2 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:54 But it was really not my fault! I wasn't hacking at all! Is there no possible way of checking this? 3 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 7:05 So this is what I've read in your FAQ: Q: I am a legit player but I am afraid of getting banned?  A: It is extremely unlikely that VAC will make a mistake when banning someone. Even if this occurs you can simply contact Steam Support who will usually lift the ban if it was given wrongly. Again, this is extremely rare.   So please...    Now you see, they wont even keep their word. I don't even think they read what I wrote there! I bet it's just somekind of an auto message! Since it was posted immediately after i posted mine. How rude of them! Im gonna be patient until tomorrow... But still, for everyone who is about to spend money on this, to this day its a pretty high price for the game, keep in my this could happen to you, too!!! ive read through some threads as well. I dont think there is hope for my siuation, since those people never responded with something positive again...
1956	0	a	another crap fps, you dont need half brain to play it, just jump around with akimbo shooting everything and you will rule! cheater dominate this game.  can I delete it from my library?
1957	0	a	There is too meny hacked lobbys on this game. Buy the Mordern Warfare 3 insted. just saying  I playid this game om ps3 for like 300 hours but the pc version is just  :/ bad
1958	0	a	Great game, bad anti-cheat. I have only owned this game for about two weeks and have already been VAC banned, for no reason at all. I don't hack in any of the games I play, and never have hacked in any games. I am dissapointed in VAC's anti-cheat, hope I can get unbanned.  Until they can ban players for legit reasons, I will continue to not play and dislike this game.
1959	0	a	i would realy like it if they added xbox controllars if you do i will recomend and fix the hackers i got banned because i was on a modded server and the hacker gave me a menu and now im vac i would really like it if you un vac banned me please!!!!!!!!!!!! i really love this game!! 
1960	0	a	Over-the-top military action, same basic package as Modern Warfare 1 but with prettier graphics and a bit more controversy. As usual, the TF141 segments are not nearly as fun as the Ranger segments, but they are the ones that play the story forward, unfortunately, whereas the Ranger parts feel more like afterthoughts.  Part of the storyline feels completely ripping off Homefront, story is convoluted and hard to follow and rather short. Barely 5 hours of gameplay. Glad I got it for cheaper.  Not even going to bother with the multiplayer...  If it's 15$ or less, not a bad deal. But more than that? Meh...
1961	0	a	I'm gonna have to say no. The gameplay and campaign are great, but multiplayer is the single reason I bought the game. Multiplayer is not the best.  Pros:  -Multiplayer is still populated -Optimized (Plays perfect on my GT-610 and i3 550).  -Fast paced gameplay -Good leveling system -Valve Anti-Cheat -No 9 year old cursing trolls, unlike the Xbox version  Cons:  -No community servers -Matchmaking system is out of whack (Look at my profile screenshots for details). -Asking questions in MP is impossible without being called a 'Nub' -Constantly migrating hosts in-game   If this game were maybe $10 instead of $20, I would definetly recommend it, but when the cons are compared to the price, I have to say no. I will still play the game, but will not buy any DLC from it.
1962	0	a	I remember how few years back, CODMW2 was released. Some chose to boycott it, others bought it. Some hated it, some loved it. For me personally, having spent few good weeks in a decent COD4 clan, which at its time was a game, where a lot of DFBHD community moved to, I remember CODMW2 being like brick, which destroyed fragile dreams. Suddenly, there were newses about lack of dedicated servers, lack of mods support and suddenly - there was no hope that CODMW2 is ever going to reach heights of COD4 and its community - and if only we were exaggerating it - reality turned out to be even worse. Yes, I'm judging MW2 by the prism of esport gaming - one of my favourite memories were of a time, I spent playing COD4 in clan and then comes MW2 - no mods support meant, no promod. This meant, that all the balancing issues would pop up with high skill esport scene, were never going to be addressed. Lack of dedicated servers meant, there is always going to be at least one person, who can potentially react faster than others. There were DLCs - which at this point in time meant, nobody in esport scene is going to even play these few more maps. And obviously - then there was one of the laziest implementations of VAC, ever. And finally - esport killing FOV, set at ridiculous 65 horizontal degrees. Everything combined, created one laggy mess of a game, full of cheaters, only made worse with near unplayable FOV. It was a mess and luckily esport-wise got nowhere. But even skipping whole esport scene case - casual-wise it wasn't relly that good of a game either. It's just that PC port was so poor, it either made me feel sick due to low FOV... or made me quit, thanks to people shooting using aimbots, wallhacks and a tons of other crap.  Furthermore, at its time, I didn't really like CODMW2 for its singleplayer, either. I remember most of my friends being extremely impressed by its singleplayer campaign, but I found game's heavy hand-holding extremely irritating. If only I knew, this problem is going to infect almost the entire shooter genre... yes, if there is reason for what happened with shooters for the last 4 years - for the existence of atrocities like Aliens: Colonial Marines, Duke Nukem: Forever, Homefront and many others - it's sadly that other developers tried to copy MW2 formula, despite for the fact it does not fit and it would have never fit their games. CODMW2 was pretty much the first military shooter, with such an incredibly scripted singleplayer campaign, where a player is constantly hold by a hand and told what to do and what not to do - where to go. This is where linear shooter ended and scripted shooters started. Admittedly, all credit to MW2 - it still manages to make for some interesting cinematic experience and some action set pieces are really good. It's just a shame, player is so often a viewer of this story instead of a hero.  I'm going to say this - if you don't mind scripting much and being hold by a hand almost the entire game - and if you really want to know how the story develops after COD4 - if you can get MW2 on sale (5â‚¬) - you should have a decent fun with it. Don't expect however to play much of a multiplayer - it's essentially dead. For multiplayer - buy good old  Call of Duty 4  or much better PC-wise  Black Ops  or  Black Ops 2 .
1963	0	a	all it needed was DServers and it would have been great :(  fun while it lasted  
1964	0	a	this game was terrible, i had it for a weekend and during that time there were so many hackers, also you cant pick what server you want to go to, its all automated.
1965	0	a	Decent multiplayer for sure but I cant recomend this game with the amount of cheaters unfortunately.
1966	0	a	Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the main game we point the finger at when we look at the negative aspects of Call of Duty, and rightfully so. Before I delve deeper, I would like to start out by addressing the controversy between Call of Duty and Battlefield. While I do prefer Battlefield, I do NOT despise the COD franchise. I had moderate enjoyment with Call of Duty 4, and a blast with Black Ops 2. However, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is easily my least favorite in the franchise. Without further ado, lets dive in.  What does Modern Warfare 2 do wrong? The first place is the campaign. While the story was decent in the game, it was a big disapointment. To no suprise, it is a linear corridoor shooter, as you mow up enemies and stop evil Russian men. Nothing new here, and there is no motivation to play the campaign. The only REAL motive I can think of is if you took alot of enjoyment in COD 4 campaign, and want to see what happens to your favorite characters in the franchise.   Next we have Spec Ops, which is a spectacular addition to the game. The minigames are superb in this game with great level design, and is a blast with friends. I took alot of enjoyment holding off enemies, mostly due to the replayabilty and freedom of this gamemode, in contrast to the Campaign, which forces you to put rockets on certain targets.   Finally we have the multiplayer, the heart and soul of the game. And let me tell you, is it horrid. This is not because the game is not 'realistic' enough - come on, we are in an arcade shooter. It is because mechanics are bad. Yes, they gel well, and the game doesn't feel clunky, but they are just flat out bad design choices. The first issue is create-a-class, which looks very dynamic at first, but essentially boils down to a handful of gun and attachment combos that are overpowered. This makes gunplay boil down not to skill, reaction time, or map knowledge - but who has the best overpowered gun. Same goes for perks and deathstreaks. I would have much more enjoyment in making a class, and finding a setup that suits my playstyle, in contrast to this game.The game also has no emphasis on teamwork, mostly due in part to killstreaks that cater completely towards racking up more kills. Not to mention, hacking in this game is horrid - but that is a whole 'nother story within itself.   To conclude, Spec Ops is not worth purchasing this game. While it is fun while it lasts, you will be forced into multiplayer, which is terrible. The games' mechanics only allow a handful of good classes, and that is the only way to do well in the game. Combined with a lack of emphasis on teamwork, the game becomes a muddled mess more than a competitive arcade shooter. If you want the best experience possible, I would highly reccomend picking up Black Ops 2, which fixes many of the problems addressed above.  
1967	0	a	Heyyo, UGH! One of my worst purchases in a while.. friends told me how great this game was, and at first? It was pretty fun.. until people found the cheapest and most broken combos... like the dual 1887 shotguns.. akimbo rifles with grenade launchers and 'slight of hand'... made me rage. This game is so broken.
1968	0	a	ultimately i feel the games not very balanced amd very slow paced. As a casual game, theres more fun ones than this one, player populations are ok, but the host systems bad, ultimately not the most fun cod exsperience in my opinion.
1969	0	a	Too much hackers.
1970	0	a	Excelent multiplayer ruined by hackers. A good camain. Can't recommend due to number of hackers.
1971	0	a	.
1972	0	a	Was fun when it first started.. now its an abandoned mall in russia
1973	0	a	Camper filled craphole filled with stupid campers and tubers and 360 intervention PROs
1974	0	a	NAT Strict, Lost Connection after 12 seconds.
1975	0	a	Use to be a good game, but you can't find a lobby now that either doesn't have hackers or doesn't lag.
1976	0	a	Someone hacked my game or something and now I get a map overlay on my entire screen. Very hard to play because you can't really see anything. I've uninstalled the local files and reinstalled from the cloud. Still the same thing.
1977	0	a	This game was bad the way it was 6 years ago, it's still bad.  I'm not gonna go over an intial review, I just want to get into the heads of everyone who thumbed this up and want to know WHYYYYY did close to 12k users and 92% of them thumbed this monstrosity up? users voted on metacritic on average 5.5 out of ten from all 3 platforms with PC at 4.0 and highest 6.1 on consoles...  I did not forget why this game was considered terrible and the start of the 'Cash cow' Mass opinion which made dewritos and marijuanas popular Until Advanced warfare came out but that only put the 'Breaks' on the dying franchise.  Dedicated servers, Remember that launch date fuss? Nobody plays this damn game anyway and nobody wants to play running Peer to peer like it's the fall of napster or Bittorrent. OP guns: Intervention, ACR, Shotty, Care package, etc, remember these issues? Offensive missions: Remember, no russian. This was just a marketing tactic because the writers are garbage. and me, Why me? Because I supported this game, raged at it and spent over 100 hours in Multiplayer on this crap. (200+ on Xbox)
1978	0	a	I don't do the MP, so this is all about the SP. I put about 160 hours into this game on PC, completed all the missions multiple times on the highest difficulty, and have almost all the achievements. If I can do that, then better players like you will do great for sure. Overall, the game was not a waste of money, but it is sad to see a great franchise focus on the features I like least. I haven't bought a COD game since this one and based on watching other people play them, I am glad I didn't. If you want the best COD experience, COD4 or COD2 will serve you well. Never played COD3 since I don't own an Xbox or whatever console that was exclusive to.   If you liked COD: Modern Warfare, this game will appeal because it is pretty much the same game with lots of minor changes. It expands on the trends that set COD4 apart from the original WW2 shooters that COD was built on, expanding the special operations focus and focusing on bond-style villains weaving fancy plots to run the world in some way.   Technology also is greatly emphasized; COD4 was built on real weapons in wide use in the early 21st-century, while COD: MW2 makes commonplace what is rare or simply theorized even today. Most guns now have electronic sights instead of ironsights, automated weapon systems like sentry guns play a prominent role, and remarkably efficient UAVs with more firepower than a B52 menace the skies. If you want a more sci-fi than real-world experience of 'modern warfare' then you have found your game. Incidentally, the poor RPG7 rocketlauncher remains a big part of the battlefield and remains unable to hit anything more than 30 feet away without a huge dose of luck. So much for modernity!   If you like the classic 'common soldier fighting for his country' theme of the original COD series, you will be in for some, but not complete, disappointment.There are maps where average soldiers still fight average soldiers from other countries, but where they are fighting often requires considerable suspension of disbelief. What is clear is that COD: MW2 is continuing the trend of the franchise towards special ops missions where the real story revolves around elite special forces units who battle sinister evil geniuses weaving great conspiracies. Common soldiers like Paratrooper Martin and Sergeant Moody are very much passe. If you want Splintercell without the stealth mechanics, this will do something for you.   Like COD4, maps are tight enough to keep players from getting too lost and open enough, most of the time, to let players do more than simply charge straight into killzones. Some maps have tedious bottlenecks that will frustrate, so expect a few ragequits unless you are a masochist like me. So far, the grenade spam problem that makes many COD games very annoying is not too strong here; certainly not as bad as COD: World At War. You will have time to rest between rushes without too much fear of an endless rain of grenades appearing out of nowhere to punish you for your laziness. Infinite respawns are pretty reasonable in this game as well, so you aren't always going to lose for not having rushed after that last enemy getting shot.   One huge feature that greatly limits the appeal of this game for me: NO PC CONSOLE! COD consoles have always been fairly limited in their utility compared to games like Halflife, but for reasons that make no sense to me, IW has decided that players don't need consoles and so now players have no ablity to fine-tune their game settings, use cheats, or even fix some issues that could have been done in the past with five seconds of typing. This massively reduces the playability of the game for me. Before this game, I loved to see the beautiful animations and graphics in slow-motion. Can't do that here and that makes me sad.  
1979	0	a	to many hacked lobbys i got in to alot of them and got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing vac banned wtf steam wtf
1980	0	a	Terrible don't waste your money!
1981	0	a	Buy this if you are dumb...I'm dumb
1982	0	a	To be totally honest, this game is not worth the money. Even on sale it's not worth it at all. The multiplayer is FULL of hackers. The only thing that's fun is the campain and the special ops but that can only last you so long. You join a game in multiplayer and you get all this op stuff... It takes away the fun and experience in leveling up. So you should hold on to your money and wait for another game you want to go on sale. Hope this helped '')
1983	0	a	This is a pitifully disgusting game now. ruined by hackers and little kids. hell both i should say. shameless lag switchers, aimbotters, wallhackers, hacked servers. Hackers killed this franchise because they have no skills and choose hacks to be better. No hackers you will never be better, if you use hacks you are less of a person and skills will always be better than hacks. and btw, you are not a hacker just because you use hacks, the person who made the hacks is a hacker, you are just subhuman scum in the gutters of forgotten humanity. if i was a zillionaire *even if that was a money amount* id buy this fncking franchise and set it straight, bring back up dedicated servers, update it with the latest hack defenses, idk theres sh!t out there. if it wasnt for hackers and little kids this would still be The Number One FPS shooter of all time. yes. im not exaggerating. But it is nice to find that one rare match where no one is actually hacking and its a non hacked lobby and acceptable connection, thats when the beauty of the game truly shines through. i dont recommend you buy this game, but you can if you want. i just bought it for old times sake because i had it on PS3.
1984	0	a	Lobbies have nothing but hackers. If your looking for the game you played on your 360/  Ps3 then this is not it. It's just hackers, who can't be killed. Infinite health, 1 shot kill water guns. If you like hackers here's your game. If they annoy you then do not purchase this game.
1985	0	a	Worst game ever. Soap and his â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mohawk...  0/10 Needs more hats
1986	0	a	The best COD game I've played. Singleplayer is great, but the multiplayer sucks, just about everyone hacks in one way or another, and most games are modified or changed in some way. Waste of money.
1987	0	a	The singleplayer is lackluster, the multiplayer is horrifically laggy, don't buy it for more than 2 cents. A shame upon a formerly good series.
1988	0	a	Marks the beginning of the end of IW and the CoD Franchise when this was released. What a terribly made console port that utterly shafted the game for all PC players. Absolute rubbish.
1989	0	a	Hackers Galore.
1990	0	a	Verdict: Passable  While more technically competent than, say, Skyrim, it's an incredibly jerky, ill-paced game that tries to do too much in its time span. Too many weapons, too many twists, too many bad guys, too many gameplay types. It's never really content to allow for falling action of any kind. As soon as you reach the final objective of a mission, it cuts to a loading screen, with hardly a line from one of your squadmates or anything to provide a moment of relaxation, a feeling that you've made it and, for the moment, you're safe. Alternating between the Rangers and TF141 on a mission-by-mission basis for the first two acts of the game ruins any sense of continuity between the missions -- with each feeling about half the length of a Call of Duty 4 mission -- further exacerbates the lack of fulfilment provided by the end of each mission, because each mission ends on a particularly poor and jarring cliffhanger and you're thrown into the rising action of another mission in another place with different people before you've had a moment to decompress. It may be that Infinity Ward was trying to keep the tension high. But, if that is the case, they confused tension with action. Yes, an all-out firefight can be tense, but it quickly loses its dramatic appeal the more you do it in a given span of time. And, since you -start- the game in a firefight and do little else besides move from one firefight to the next, aside from some parts of some of the TF141 missions, you're basically forced to keep an adrenaline high for almost the entirety of the game's runtime. This also prevents even minimal characterization. So, when characters are killed, there is no emotional impact because there was no time or cause for you to become emotionally invested in them.   Even the death of Ghost is completely forgettable, because while he's present for almost the entirety of the game, he spends almost all of it off screen, and never does anything important or unique to distinguish himself from the rest of the TF141 mooks during the brief time he's a physical presence.   While there are some things the game does well, such as the first mission with Roach and Soap and the way the end of 'Of Their Own Accord' and the beginning of 'Second Sun' tied together (the beginning of 'Second Sun' honestly took me by surprise), they are few and far between, lost in the sharp scene changes and deafening non-stop gunfire.  I'd be lying if I said the story lacked drama, but most of what drama it has immediately falls apart when you think about how ludicrous the plot is. The villain's plan was needlessly complicated, bloody, and destructive, especially given its purpose, which could have been accomplished much easier and cleaner with the clever usage of media and politics. But what broke my suspension of disbelief was not how out of hand it got, not how far off the deep end the villain had gone to even consider it to be a good idea, but how willing the villain's lackeys were to let him carry on and how freely they seemed to provide their assistance. It is clear they are trying to top the first Modern Warfare. However, the first Modern Warfare was already pushing the limits of reason while still trying to set the stakes high. Modern Warfare 2 front-loads so much ridiculous escalation, much of it climax-worthy material, that you really can't help but think every time 'It  can't get any worse.' And yet it always does, and never in a good way. If I didn't know any better, I'd say there was a team at Infinity Ward that did nothing but sit around and play 'One Up' for the entirety of the script-writing process, just to come up with new ways to turn up the heat, regardless of whether or not they actually made sense in the grand scheme of things. The scene of using foxholes and trenches to avoid machine gun nests on your approach to a ruined, Russian-occupied White House screams WWII callback. Aside from that, though, it does little but try to show the player just how bad things are in DC by stirring up patriotic anger. The same kind of patriotic anger that the game itself practically condemning, both in its plot and in the quotes that are displayed on screen after you die. And, by this point, the game has gone on far too long with its messages of treason through patriotism for that to be the point. Not to mention, the game isn't smart enough for it to have ever been the point to begin with.  When they announced the original Modern Warfare, Infinity Ward said they wanted to make the campaign feel a lot more like a film. And they succeeded. With a well-paced plot that followed a clear dramatic arc, parallel subplots that contributed to the overall scenario in a positive manner without weighing it down, missions that had their own miniature dramatic arcs, and the sense of danger and urgency needed to justify the faster-paced gameplay, Modern Warfare was a good action movie. While most of the actors went without characterization beyond 'Spec-Ops hardass', 'Military grunt', or 'Total evil psychopath', such archetypes are pretty much standard for military action movies, and they were neither over-done nor hammed up, and were almost always present, leading to a solid core cast you came to care at least a -little- about by the end. Combine that with carefully-placed and well-handled twists -- the end of Jackson's subplot in particular was wrung out for as much drama as they could justify -- it was a game that, despite ending up as the spearhead of the subgenre that has taken over the FPS, stands out as an example of trying something new with a franchise without completely butchering the job. Modern Warfare 2, on the other hand, is the result of trying to capitalize on the success of a new idea without understanding what made the new idea  good .  If you're  desperately  curious to find out what happened to Soap and Captain Price following the events of Call of Duty 4, or you just want to understand what all the fuss is about, Modern Warfare 2 is worth a play, with some emphasis on 'a play', as in the singular. If not, perhaps you can help unmake the rest of the franchise by silencing  its  truth, leaving only the deaths of 30,000 Marines, and the sacrifice of the 22nd SAS to avenge them, that the horrors of that week would not return to haunt the future.
1991	0	a	I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.
1992	0	a	'Did a double MOAB with a sniper, after a time I found out that I didn't equip MOAB then I rage quited' 11/9 - IGN
1993	0	a	I use to enjoy this multiplayer game but it is being hack so much you can't find a decent game.. I tried playing yesterday and it was completely hacked. Don't think the creators are monitoring for hackers any more. They have pretty much abandoned the game.
1994	0	a	+ Good campaign + Spec Ops is fun + Good weapons + Very good multiplayer maps + Full of configurable settings - No FoV system - No console access - Missing alot of configurable settings - Mouse sensitivity system does not feel confortable - You can't ALT+TAB while in-game - No controller support - (RUINED BY CHEATERS)  -----------------------   MY RATING:     5.8   out of 10 -----------------------
1995	0	a	Every lobby is hacked, basically unplayable.
1996	0	a	Brutal online gaming. People love to hack into the game. Doesnt make the game fun at all. Please fix!!
1997	0	a	Full of Hackers?. Yes. Matchmaking will put you into hacked lobby's randomly?. Yes. Hacked lobby's will ruin your stats and auto unlock everything?. Yes. There is no point of playing after your stats where hacked therefore you won't grind to unlock prestige. Only way I found to fix my stats to start from 0 and save my progress as I played incase I ran into a hacked lobby was using a program that would would reset stats and save my progress. After 400 hours steam decided this program I was running was a hack and I got VAC banned and lost my game and my profile is marked as a hacker. I wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy.
1998	0	a	Not a very good game, toxic community.
1999	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this to many moders
2000	0	a	gay af full of dropshottng ump45 sweaty nerd bogan inbreds
2001	0	a	This game is great. USUALLY. The multiplayer is next to unplayable because of all the hackers. You are most likely going to join a lobby, (which some hacker will be in control off) and get boosted to Level 70. Then, Valve Anti-Cheat is going to VAC ban you because you were boosted. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a waste of money and a terrible experience. Everything else is great though.
2002	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Don't get me wrong this is one of my favorite games ever but IW has completely given up on anti cheat and almost every single person cheats. Not like they aim too fast, like 4 c-130s circling around the map at once while the host flies around with dual grenade launchers telling everyone to get rekt I repeat  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
2003	0	a	The game is very fun and an older cod that brings back memories... But the multiplayer system is hacked. I would have about 80 hours right now... but I just wasted my money buying a game that doesn't have multiplayer. If you are in a lobby with hackers, you'll most likely get banned. I could go on but this isn't worth it.
2004	0	a	i do not recommend this game, because in multiplayer there could be a hacked server resulting in unlocking EVERYTHING, for some people its AWESOME, but not to me because it just ruins the point in multiplayer with unlocking everything altogether, so i would like a refund because of that, thats the reason for MY refund
2005	0	a	My mutiplayer dont load!!!!!!!
2006	0	a	12 year olds cussing more than sailors.... same BS game play as EVERY CoD... and players who in my honest opinion need to get outta the house a bit more...
2007	0	a	So, multiplayer is still working great.  Not. 
2008	0	a	This game fails to load multiplayer on my mac, there is no reason for this to happen so I don't know why it does. I've looked it up and there are many reports of this problem but no fixes
2009	0	a	Community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, gameplay is boring. But I love the kids screaming hacker &lt;3 10/10
2010	0	a	My multiplayer for MW2 doesn't load. I just bet a black screeb
2011	0	a	The online gameplay in it's current state (sept 16 2014) is unplayable, there are barely any players (300 to 500) and matchmaking is worse than ever. This game is overrun with hackers and I'm not exaggerating. My minimap has been permanently disabled from hacks used by other players. There will be at least 1 hacker in every game, usually more. I see people using aimbots in EVERY game.
2012	0	a	This game maybe good on console, but on pc this game is absolute garbage. Its full of hackers, noobtubers and hardly anyone plays, so most of the time you run into at least 1 hacker per lobby.   I'm only giving this game a thumbs down because of how much this game is hacked. I recommand that is you want to play this game, go buy it on console because you will have way more fun.
2013	0	a	Tp be real I have no idea why they say this is the best cod game of all time, maybe in sales. The game is ok, the multiplayer is crap because everyone is cheating, and not just a little, a whole lot, and no one gets kicked,to me it is the worst call of duty ever.
2014	0	a	Not the best game to play if you want to play a FPS. Single player is quite bad and short, multiplayer is a non-strategical mode, just shoot and respawn and shoot more while being shot by 15-y-o kids who are screaming at his mic (and in fact are better at shooting and screaming than you).  Buying it for 25 euros was a waste of money and I regret it. Even if it was 5 euros, I'd be upset.
2015	0	a	It's now full of hackers. I decided to rejoin my nostalgic game of MW2, but as soon as I joined a lobby, I was instantly hacked and prestiged. Good, yet bad at the same time :&lt;.
2016	0	a	Hate it because theres hackers and i got vac banned for no reason at all they have no proof if i hacked or not DONT GET IT wait for Black Ops III
2017	0	a	Got VAC-Banned because a hacker unlocked everything in my account (Still think this is total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.) Now I have a VAC-Ban on my record for NO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING REASON!
2018	0	a	A great game, that is completely unmonitored, with hackers in most lobbies with the ability to change your rank and remove all of the weapons you've unlocked. It's a broken game now, don't buy it if you want it for multiplayer.
2019	0	a	Pls don't buy this game. I've played it 3 days and have to deal with nothing but scumbag kids with trainers. save your money for something better than this
2020	0	a	Had fun playing the campaign Multiplayer was fun for the time I got to play it Left game to see I was level 70 Got vac banned can't play game anymore  3/8 campaign was good, but if you don't wanna get vac banned don't waste your money.
2021	0	a	A great game left to decompose.   As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD.
2022	0	a	I don't reccomend this game it is a waste of money. I was just playing nearly level 70 and then i get into a hacked lobby i left and now whenever i go into a online game i get kicked for nothing and then it says 'Cheat Detected' but i don't mod modern warfare 2 and then when i go into a private match i see as a command i think and says 'Cannot kick host player' millions of times and have to reset my stats every time i go on fix this and i will be keeping it if you don't fix this it is getting sold
2023	0	a	10/10 wouldn't recommend
2024	0	a	Single player very good, Multiplayer HACK CITY. Is terrrible, steam does not care, publisher does not care, do not get it.
2025	0	a	I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.  Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:  It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience.   While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public Â£100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.  This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned.
2026	0	a	Stopped working after a week. Activision gave â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ support. I wish that I bought this game AFTER Steam refunds became a thing.
2027	0	a	The baby one.
2028	0	a	Any Call of Duty in the series will tear you apart. How you may ask? Well, Let's just say 'vocab', and rage. That is what I best describe this game. Also, this will tear your family apart as well.
2029	0	a	It Keeps Saying Cheat Detected For No Reason... FIX IT!!!!
2030	0	a	Back in the day I would have suggested this game. I spent crazy hours playing Multiplayer Online. It's such a shame that the PC version multiplayer is dead now. I hear that Xbox is still alive. The single player was fun but short. Bad Company 2 was my next FPS and I enjoyed the single player more.         RATE:   3 OUT OF 10     
2031	0	a	Honestly don't buy it if you want to get a lot of time out of it and play multiplayer. Youtubers and reviews all said that multiplayer has a ton of hackers that will hurt your steam/computer and even some take out all exit functions. So I didn't play multiplayer, which is a large part of the game. I got about 10 hours out of this game before getting bored of it, and five of which were campaign and the other five special ops. Campaign is much better. Special ops is pretty fun, but it can be annoying trying to get new missions by playing the ones you hate. Overall, save the $20 and go buy Cs:go or Cod4 (which has multiplayer thats not hacked as much)
2032	0	a	Keeps crashing its a peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
2033	0	a	don't make the same mistake i did nobody plays this game on multiplayer anymore so basically all you have is a 3 hour campaign and special ops that basically suck
2034	0	a	Best COD released but its crap now cuz of all hackers
2035	0	a	Each week I play it seem there are more hacked games and many more games with poor host, dropped connections. The CoD MWII experience on line is getting worse...don't think I'll be playing online for much longer.
2036	0	a	I would love to say a must have... but this makes CoD4 looks seperior. And the Yearly-New CoD game destroys this franchise.
2037	0	a	Thanks for getting me vac banned. Although i didn't use any cheat :) because i joined a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hacked lobby so i am banned.. -_-
2038	0	a	Campaign is another dull, Brown People/Foreigner Murder simulator 2009. Lacks any wit or intelligence present in COD4. The multiplayer is hailed as the best of the series, but then again what do 11 year olds know? The only redeeming qualtiy of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fest is the Spec Ops missions, which are occasionally fun to play.
2039	0	a	all it needed was DServers and it would have been great :(  fun while it lasted  
2040	0	a	My multiplayer for MW2 doesn't load. I just bet a black screeb
2041	0	a	Dont buy this game random vacbans and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for no reasons
2042	0	a	liked the campaign but hate the multi player.total chaos
2043	0	a	Too many hackers.
2044	0	a	Steam took it away from me after about a week for no reason i Called them and they said we cant allow a game like this is out web.site
2045	0	a	this game was terrible, i had it for a weekend and during that time there were so many hackers, also you cant pick what server you want to go to, its all automated.
2046	0	a	Multiplayer was fun for the first 3-4 months after release. No dedicated servers, Punk Buster or any post launch support to deal with hackers meant that after people figured out how to hack it the game was truely unplayable.  
2047	0	a	hi i get cod6 and i play it 9 hours and i get baned for no reason now i can't play and like evry normal people i get mad and i want to fix that s**t and i want to be unbaned to have posibility to play these game  Somebody how have the same problem to help me please.  Sory for my bad english
2048	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game dont buy its full of cheaters
2049	0	a	so many hackers
2050	0	a	Fun for a while, but the community isn't as great compared to other fps games. Community is lacking compared to the CS series.
2051	0	a	The multiplayer is a hacker ridden graveyard. Do not spend your money on this.
2052	0	a	Used to be a great game, Multiplayer that is. Now its just crap and full of stupid mods. Its no fun anymore.
2053	0	a	Ok, multiplayer is fine and awesome but, the multiplay I just got VAC banned because since there are so much hackers it thought I was hacking. 3/10
2054	0	a	VALVE SORT THE HACKING NOOBS OUT IN THIS GAME WASTE OF  Â£40
2055	0	a	This game maybe good on console, but on pc this game is absolute garbage. Its full of hackers, noobtubers and hardly anyone plays, so most of the time you run into at least 1 hacker per lobby.   I'm only giving this game a thumbs down because of how much this game is hacked. I recommand that is you want to play this game, go buy it on console because you will have way more fun.
2056	0	a	It is very good game but i choose the negative vote because the hackers ruined this game. 1.I lost my level progress by a hacker and i couldnt get it back. 2.There are a lot kids who kicks everyone out of the lobby except if you stand and they do 360 stupid shots. 3.A lot wallhackers and aimboters. 4.The nat is buggy and dosnt work with all routers properly so even if the port is open you cant host a game to avoid the modded lobbys. 5.They removed the Favela one of the best map on the game. 
2057	0	a	It is a good game, but i can never get in a lobby with out a hacker! way to many hackers, the MOST u should get it for is around $10 $15. 6.5/10
2058	0	a	The best COD game I've played. Singleplayer is great, but the multiplayer sucks, just about everyone hacks in one way or another, and most games are modified or changed in some way. Waste of money.
2059	0	a	Alot of hackers on multiplayer. You will most likely get hacked to max perstiege and get all weps. You will prob join a hacked lobby on first try.
2060	0	a	The game is to short. 6 hours on normal mode, and i died plenty of times
2061	0	a	1st of all, I HATE the CoD games, I mean I HATE IT SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MUCH, but this game is different from the others. The single player is full with action and adrenaline rich. The multiplayer, well its still a blood bath but can be fun. But some other players included me miss some features, for example the Server Browser, the Mod section, and the admin commands. If you love the FPS games, its for you. But the kiddos can ruin everything, so sometimes the mute function the best in the whole game. I really recommend it!
2062	0	a	I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game.

2063	0	a	This game used to be amazing in the past. I'm here to write a more accurate up to date review as of August 2014. This game is complete garbage now, with Call of duty 4 still having 10x the playerbase, this game has a flat 300 players for its playerbase, half the games are still to this day filled with hackers, and not to mention errors that this game comes with as soon as its installed, its a shame this game has gone to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, do not make my mistake and purchase this garbage, if you want something worth your money, call of duy 4 is still an amazing gem.
2064	0	a	Used to be a decent game.. blah blah blah... infinity ward is a horrible company, never buy from them ever.... blah blah blah... what else can I say that will inform even a single individual about what a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game this is today? There is nothing. So.. if you've not bought this game for whatever reason and you're thinking about it. Stop. Don't do it. Don't ever bother with Infinity Ward again.
2065	0	a	I would totally reccomend this game if you are willing to go into a privat match with your friends and play against each other. Other than that no. The multiplayer is destroyed and not fun at all. With all the hackers its not even remotley fun. Makes you wonder why game developers abandon good games to drive people to the newer 'better' games like CoD Ghosts. Activison has become a money seeking company. One of the last good CoDs and will always remember it as a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game cause of my latest expirences with the multiplayer. And you can only play the campaign so many times before you are bored out of your mind.
2066	0	a	Hackers everywhere you go.
2067	0	a	this game has a lot of hacker so no i dont recommend this game
2068	0	a	Needs to have the valve Cheat Symbol removed.
2069	0	a	Very good game but to many hackers...i don't want play anymore...Nobody protect us from hackers!!
2070	0	a	too many hacked lobbies.
2071	0	a	It's hacked to death, spawns are broken, rapid fire 2 shotting guns, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ maps, and a terrible commmuntiy. Other than that it's great!
2072	0	a	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was the most popular Call of Duty of all time. It has an engaging campaign and the visuals at the time were top notch. But its glory days have passed. The multiplayer is riddled with hacks and it is almost impossible to find an unhacked server. So if you are looking at this game for the multiplayer then I would look elsewhere. If you are looking at this then I would wait until the price drops but until then I cannot recommend this game simply because of its age and non working service.
2073	0	a	Im going to try to be fair with this one as ive strayed away from the call of duty franchise for many reasons (the only one i enjoyed out of all of them was 4). The Pros: Graphics, Music (Hans Zimmer, enough said) Sound, and finally Voiceacting; these were all amazing. The Cons: No dedicated servers, extremely broken multiplayer (unbalanced weapons, broken spawns etc), no kicking banning or choosing map types either. Lots of exploits and glitches as well as hackers. Infinity Ward basically restricted the game from having any fun when you think about it. Personally i wish i could get my money back.
2074	0	a	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was good when it came out.  Now it is just sad. With all those hackers and their hack servers sending you to prestige 10, when you wanna level up yourself and earn all those things.  i managed to get prestige 4 before getting into a hacked server which turned me into prestige 10.  So i've done my fair share of resetting. But then i got tired of resetting every now and then and eventually stopped playing.  Back in the day i would score it 10/10 but today i will probably score it 3/10
2075	0	a	It could have been fun. But there are no dedicated servers, so one of the players is chosen to serve as host, which usually results in a terrible connection and a lot of lag. Once the game notices that, it looks for another host. The original host is kicked after the host migration (because the game obviously has to be as annoying as possible), and the thing starts all over again. If no other host is found, everyone is just thrown out of the game. There is also no way to kick or ban the hackers, which is great fun as well. The same thing goes for hacked lobbies - sometimes, you join a game that is modified, meaning some weapons can't be used, the game mode is different, your settings and stats can be changed and other things. Of course, there's nothing you can do about it. Dedicated servers would fix that as well. Of course, those are impossible, because Activision says so. Giving you the ability to play the game mode you want without lags and with the ability to ban hackers could actually make this game fun! We obviously can't have that. So: If you're lucky and get a host with a good connection, you can play the Team Deathmatch mode. No one bothers to queue for other game modes, because there's not enough people playing them - of course, hacked lobbies do have other modes from time to time. And if you're really, really lucky, maybe there's no hacker in the game either, so you can even enjoy it.
2076	0	a	Got banned, kind of expected this because of all of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hacked lobbys
2077	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2078	0	a	Hackers are the most annoying thing, other than that its good. There are many hackers Always ruin the game.
2079	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this to many moders

2089	0	a	this game so old there was only 2 dorietos flavors when it was made
2090	0	a	'still rocks. no ded. servers but still better than BlackOps.' - Thats been my Review... until now.  Dont get me wrong, this game is awesome and I love playing Multiplayer. Oh wait. I loveD. But since they sued 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥net' and '4deltaone', which did a pretty great job with developing some modification for this game (New Gamemodes, New Maps, Dedicated Servers...) it just got horrible.  Sorry InfinitiyWard - but your policies really suck. No one buys this game anymore. No one plays it anymore. So why do you even care if somebody makes it playable for the last remaining fans?  'Black Ops' was the last CoD I bought after MW2 - and I did regret it - it felt like playing in mud... But those lawsuits against 4deltaone make it clear: CoD is dead (for me!), I will switch to Battlefield, DayZ and ArmA. R.I.P. CoD, its been a great time. ;)
2091	0	a	Excelent multiplayer ruined by hackers. A good camain. Can't recommend due to number of hackers.
2092	0	a	Someone hacked my game or something and now I get a map overlay on my entire screen. Very hard to play because you can't really see anything. I've uninstalled the local files and reinstalled from the cloud. Still the same thing.
2093	0	a	Don't even waste your money
2094	0	a	I really liked this game but its multiplayer was ruined by cheaters and hackers &gt;:-[
2095	0	a	Umm this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the gameplay is amazing its just i got VAC banned for no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing reason so im â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2096	0	a	There are not that many people playing it anymore and there are a bunch of modded lobbies and cheaters.
2097	0	a	TERRIBLE DONT BUY IT
2098	0	a	Guys i Download this game but how i change language from russia to english Pls need help
2099	0	a	You get banned for no reason (Error Detected Hack) hate modded lobbys
2100	0	a	first of all, COD on Steam? nope. dont bother &gt;-&lt; there are hackers evreyehere. its a hacker paradise. just get this game on xbox 360 and its not bad. mW2 is a decent game, but not on steam. the campaign is playable and spec-ops is pointless scince you cant unlock any other missions ._. oh and   Xxx_MLGFaZeCLAN360PU$$YDESTROYER_xxX  dont forget the dew and doritos.
2101	0	a	To be totally honest, this game is not worth the money. Even on sale it's not worth it at all. The multiplayer is FULL of hackers. The only thing that's fun is the campain and the special ops but that can only last you so long. You join a game in multiplayer and you get all this op stuff... It takes away the fun and experience in leveling up. So you should hold on to your money and wait for another game you want to go on sale. Hope this helped '')
2102	0	a	Lobbies have nothing but hackers. If your looking for the game you played on your 360/  Ps3 then this is not it. It's just hackers, who can't be killed. Infinite health, 1 shot kill water guns. If you like hackers here's your game. If they annoy you then do not purchase this game.
2103	0	a	Ok, multiplayer is fine and awesome but, the multiplay I just got VAC banned because since there are so much hackers it thought I was hacking. 3/10
2104	0	a	old, few europeans, all noobish russians playing causing ur ping to be so high
2105	0	a	so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bad i can go play because ''steam must be running to play this game'' and i cant fix it â™¥â™¥â™¥ this!!! 
2106	0	a	Too many hackers, too many 'instant 70' servers, I really like the game, but at least playing the multiplayer on steam is not recommended at all.
2107	0	a	this is the most broken â™¥â™¥â™¥ piece of people actually think this thing is good
2108	0	a	to many hackers and i cant play becasue the update paused and the hard drive is full thats bull
2109	0	a	The multi-player is hacked to pieces. If you don't have enough friends to host your own site, forget about it.
2110	0	a	I got Banned for no reason...... 10/10 would play again
2111	0	a	Forgetable shooter, played the single player campagn, nothing stuck out in my mind. im a big fan of story and fun in my games and this has neither, unless you are looking for multiplayer, avoid like the plague. there are much better games out there than this
2112	0	a	Great game dont get me wrong! I love this and would still be playing.. But stupid hackers are every where! My friend is now banned from modern warfare 2 because we were in a hacked lobby. YES, the hacker was fine, but not the innocent.. such bull****. He didnt hack yet he was banned. Good job VAC!!!!!!!!!! GOOD F****** JOB. Good game, non existent, I Bought it for PS3 recently too and hackers are there too. Sadly not worth the money
2113	0	a	not nice you kan kill my brothers in it.....
2114	0	a	.
2115	0	a	Was fun when it first started.. now its an abandoned mall in russia
2116	0	a	great game worth your money, but wouldnt buy it if you wanted to play multiplayer as you join a game to have fun and rank up and automaticaly your max rank and have everything due to hackers who have made the game theirs by tuning the games their way, so they always win and you cant play the game you intended to play unless you host a private match where you cant level up  this is dissapointing due to spending money on the game :( !
2117	0	a	OK, SO HERE'S THE DEAL: - You have to unlock gamemodes (Wha?) - No one plays search and destroy (Best game-mode) - No one plays anything hardcore, everyone plays teamdeath - Can't change FOV - No server browser, everything is hosted by players - No custom mods or maps - Can't alt-tab out of game when in match  Don't buy this trash, get a real game - GET CALL OF DUTY 4  - ALL GAMEMODES UNLOCKED AT LVL1 - EVERYONE PLAYS SEARCH AND DESTROY - ALL GAMEMODES ARE PLAYED 24/7 - CAN CHANGE FOV - SERVER BROWSING - AN UNGODLY AMOUNT OF MODS, CUSTOM MAPS, CUSTOM GUNS, CUSTOM EVERYTHING - AND FINALLY, YOU CAN ALT-TAB OUT OF GAME WHENEVER YOU WANT  HALLELUJAH COD4
2118	0	a	This game is good in gameplay and all that stuff, but there is one thing that makes the game unplayable, hackers.  Now, I'm not talking about aimbot or some lame exuse when I get killed or something like that. I'm talking about LEGIT hackers/moders.   Almost EVERY multi player server you go on, it will be hacked. I can't even PLAY the game anymore because some hacker put this GIANT MAP in the middle of my screen! Even if I restart the game it's still there.  They also have acess to your LOADOUTS too, and some hacker took ALL my items from me.  Would I recommend this? Well, maybe. If you don't mind all the hacking and taking away all your items and giant maps on the screen. Just maybe.
2119	0	a	It used to be fun when I played multiplayer with my friends but the game itself isn't fun.  The multiplayer is unbalanced, full of immateur idiots and lacks variety (by saying that I mean community made maps, mods and etc.) it only has few maps and it isn't fun to play most of them. To get few more maps and gamemodes, you have to buy expansion packs for ridiculous price and the game itself has ridiculous price.   The singleplayer isn't very good too. Its story is naive and illogical. It would look interesting probably only for 8 year old children.  There are only few things in this game that are fun but you shouldn't buy it for such price. There are more much cheaper, more interesting and more balanced first person shooters to buy.
2120	0	a	I would not recommend buying this game at this point cuz it is more than 4 years old. The game has almost no players left on multi player and most of the time you get the same enemies over and over again. Most of the gamemodes in the game have 0 players. In total the game has around 1000 players.
2121	0	a	Well the bad thing is there are so MANY hackers and if they get VAC Ban, they just make new account and share their library.. so they can get back on and hack again easily so I think the anti cheat should work better to stop the hackers from ruining the game I stopped playing MW2 and barely play it because of hackers. GOOD THING: It's cheap, great game but just too many hackers. Hope this helped. If you get this game I recommend just playing single player and on servers with no hackers.
2122	0	a	played game got free â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ from hacker. couldn't quit got a free vac ban 10/10 would play again
2123	0	a	This Call of Duty was the first step downward, and it sunk every year, even more and more.
2124	0	a	huge disappointment from CoD4: Modern warfare.
2125	0	a	dead game but for really i lied there are real players but they are haker))
2126	0	a	Just awful, avoid at all costs.
2127	0	a	Its an OK game, but there are many hackers/Modders on the multiplayer side of it, witch i dont like.
2128	0	a	how boring can this game be? no one moves around, everyones sits in a corner waiting what a waste of time
2129	0	a	With nearly a thousand hours played in Singleplayer and Multiplayer it makes me sad to give this a negative review now. I loved this game. I used to play this all f****n day long after school with my friends and even made new friends.   It used to be the best game I ever played but now it's literally dead except for hackers, campers and ofcourse trolls. To bad that the newer games don't give the same feeling like this one did. I guess it's time to say goodbye and finally uninstall it.  May my memory of this game stay always in my mind and the pure joy that I felt, shall stay in my heart. RIP &lt;/3
2130	0	a	No dedicated server support in multiplayer. Not only does this mean there is virtually no ability to play on custom user created maps (unless you play locally) but it means you get put in games with no attention to connection issues, skill level or map choice. This one thing alone ruined it for me. If this doesn't bother you I'd say it's a great game, all of what you'd expect from the COD series. Haven't gotten much into the single player campaign yet but what I've played has been pretty decent.
2131	0	a	i do like the game but im consantly getting only one bar connections. can anyone help me  
2132	0	a	buying the dlc broke my game and i cant play domination anymore
2133	0	a	Lack of players makes this game less enjoyable than it used to be.
2134	0	a	Game randomly decided not to start after a new steam patch, dont waste your money, go buy the disc at gamestop or from somewhere that will escape you from steam's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ service
2135	0	a	This game is amazing, campaign and multiplayer, but when you try to play multiplayer, its like super rare not to end up in a hacked or modded lobby, I would recommend this game... but too many hackers 
2136	0	a	Even though my computer exceeds the minimum requirements to run this game, multiplayer still doesnt seem to start up as quick as the campaign or special ops.
2137	0	a	good game but lot of hackers. 
2138	0	a	Got VAC banned for random connect to hacked server GG
2139	0	a	One of the best online shooters to date which is sadly filled with hackers nowadays.
2140	0	a	Its an OK game, but there are many hackers/Modders on the multiplayer side of it, witch i dont like.
2141	0	a	So... this game. This is also probably the 50 millionth review you've read for it.  The single player pretty much took everything that made Modern Warfare 1 great, repeated it ad nauseum, then tacked on a omg amurrka is under attack theme. It didn't work.  Some pros with this game though is Keith David. Because Keith David.  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202966/  - He can Oscar Mike me anytime he damn well pleases.  Other pros are the Ramirez, do everything meme. Regardless of what anyone says, that meme is solid gold and I laugh whenever it comes up.  The multiplayer features 3 maps, lots of optional downloadable content at cost, hackers, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing. If you want to succeed at this game's multiplayer, just attach a grenade launcher to an assault rifle, use the Scavenger and Explosive Damage perks, and provide your team-mates with some morale-boosting Heavy Metal micspam.
2142	0	a	Twelvies. Oh God so many Twelvies...
2143	0	a	This game was really good then i figuered out that they used the ending in the beginning of ghost
2144	0	a	The community i just full of people who are old to this game so i reccomend that you dont buy this game after 2013 because youll just keep getting deathstreaks
2145	0	a	Great for a call of duty game, but compared to good games it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2146	0	a	DonÂ´t look at the negative reviews to find some faults. Go and buy this awesome Call of Duty &lt;3
2147	0	a	I would like to update my old review from back in 2014 in January 1st.  I'll keep it short by saying that I wouldn't recommend this game.  The singleplayer is fun but what most people are probably after is the multiplayer which this game is not-so-great with - maybe back when it first came out?  I find I'm lagging constantly (with good internet) and the game also seems to crash a lot telling me there are 'file mismaches' to which I've gone and fixed with the validation of game files to which the game STILL tells me that I have mismatched files.
2148	0	a	Can't say this game is all that great anymore. The single campaign is just not gripping and lasts 5 or 6 hours at best. There are still some people playing multiplayer, but you're SOL if you want to play anything other than Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Search and Destroy. Really only pick this up if you have nostalgia from playing it on an old console.
2149	0	a	5/10 lame propaganda. gameplay itself -get shot just get to cover and you will be good while everyone else is an idiot -runs out and dies from a few shots.
2150	0	a	there's a lot of hacker â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in multiplayer
2151	0	a	'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better.
2152	0	a	I got banned for nothing dont buy this game ...
2153	0	a	Joined 3 matches literally 8 people using aimbot and 5 people noob tubing FUN
2154	0	a	This franchise shoud be call of Hacks!!
2155	0	a	Whos up for talking about the campaign? NO ONE! There was a few nice mission but half way through it started to fell dull. The ending was super bad. Mute everyone in the lobby and hide the chat and youre all good. Try not to play scrapyard, its filled with people who enjoys the tubes. Its aged well.
2156	0	a	This Part of the Call of Duty Frabchise was pretty much fun back in the days of its release, nowdays you will most likely only find hacked lobbies &amp; hackers playing online. Still it was much fun to play the first year after release.  Nowdays I would not recommend buying it, only for story mode.
2157	0	a	Everything works fine except if you want to play a game with a friend. You either have to get extremly lucky and manage to join join a friends lobby/game or just spend ages trying over and over to join (No guarantee it will work). I understand It's a reasonably old game but that doesn't excuse one of the main components of the game not working.  So if you are looking to play with a friend don't bother. :/ Very dissapointed.
2158	0	a	MW2 single player is by far the best, but I would avoid if your looking to play online multiplayer unless you enjoy cheating, hacking piece of crap players that still suck even when they cheat...servers are all full of cheating â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ heads that ruin a great game! generation of waste
2159	0	a	It's a console import. If you own it already on Xbox 360 or PS3 then do NOT buy it on steam. You are better off with Call of Duty 4 because it has PC exclusive features and a bigger community.
2160	0	a	Simply one of the best Call of Duty's out there, but this game is nearly broken but the hackers, snipers, and Danger Close noob tubes. Not worth $20 anymore.
2161	0	a	Shooter on rails
2162	0	a	COD SUCKS!
2163	0	a	THIS GAME IS HACKED!!!!!!!
2164	0	a	i was put in a modded lobby and then ban servers are bad need fixing still after so many years
2165	0	a	Keeps crashing its a peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
2166	0	a	As a CoD veteran (CoD, CoD:GO, CoD 2, CoD:MW, CoD:WaW), i was VERY disapointed with this game once i played it for the first time. And im still a bit disapointed every time i load it. Activision tried to be a hipster and killed actual servers the thing every FPS so far was OK with. But no... Activision have to make changes, even destroy dedicated servers in order to look like they're doing something out there. That step was a TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING MISTAKE. And unspeakable disgrace. With one move they destroyed MW:2. Still its a great COPY of a game, after a while you can get used to the damn thing.
2167	0	a	dead as all hell, and I have been nothing but apathetic about it.  although this game historically is strange, highlighting some of the most stupid descisions ever made by businesses- Removing dedicated servers, hogging profits, and just drama galore.  this was something EVERYBODY played, then modern warfare 3 happened, everybody moved to it and MW2 died.  it had something I did like about mutliplayer- and that is sustainability- a sense of progression, even if it is a stupid grind, at least there's clear and obtainable rewards. (too many F2P shooters and thier â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ EXPIRING PARTS, die please.)  after this game, modern warfare went down the damn hill, way down the damn hill.
2168	0	a	it was okay
2169	0	a	The start of the decent of Call of Duty...
2170	0	a	its ok...barely played it
2171	0	a	Nobody plays it................
2172	0	a	The baby one.
2173	0	a	Black screen on widows XP I canÂ´t launch it!!!
2174	0	a	The lack of dedicated servers really hurts the game, if you get into a hacked lobby you'll get VAC banned, plus nobody plays it, if you plan to buy this, please don't; if you are doing it for 'da ztory', just get another shooty game with a good story (may I recommend Bioshock Infinite?).  tl;dr fon't buy this, ever.
2175	0	a	This is where Call of Duty began its long decline. Single player (as most of the game in this series) is good and fascinating and multiplayer HAD its good moments (TDM and S&amp;D) but the matchmaking system is really bad. As soon as Black Ops got released this game pretty much died and survives only with hackers dominating servers. I would buy this game now only for &lt;10â‚¬ for its single player part (if you liked Call of Duty 4, which is still largely played and the best Call of Duty ever in my opinion)
2176	0	a	Great game back in the day(Review doesnt show it but I have approx. 600 hours on multiplayer), is now a ghost town and run by hackers. Get it on console, you can get a pre-owned copy for less than 3 pounds, has *way* more players on it and less hacker while this still costs 20 pounds.  On a side note, the single player visuals hold up extremely well.
2177	0	a	This game is absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, too much hackers, campers and people that spray with G18s... I recommend people to buy ArmA or Battlefield instead of any of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ CoDs
2178	0	a	It's full fo hackers and good luck getting a refund... f**k this game.
2179	0	a	Ingame Settings are so bad you can't change FOV or open console, its locked at what looks like 55 making unplayable while sitting at a deks
2180	0	a	This is my story. I've bought this game several months ago and I really enjoyed it untill today! From (Random date in the beggining of October 2013) untill January 6th 2014, the game was great I really liked it, but today (7th January) in every server I join is either hacked or looses connection. I think today will be the last time I'll play this game.   Oh, I also forgot to say, that I was level 42, but after a 5 seconds game in a hacked server, I got to level 70! I want to enjoy the game normally, not getting in a hacked lobby every time I search for a TDM server! These â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING hackers ruined my CoD MW2 experience!  THANK YOU HACKERS!!!  You may see that this review was posted on the 20th October, yes at first I said that this is probably the best CoD ever, but now I understood how much I was wrong :(
2181	0	a	Game is crud. Reported to the FBI. 10/10. I wouldn't even waste one hour on this pile of crud.
2182	0	a	Thanks for getting me vac banned. Although i didn't use any cheat :) because i joined a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hacked lobby so i am banned.. -_-
2183	0	a	I sunk an unhealthy amount of time into this game and truly enjoyed the competitive nature of it. Unfortunately the game became overrun with cheaters and Activision seemed more interested in churning out DLC rather than fix the problem. Because of that I cannot recommend this game and in fact have never played a COD game again.
2184	0	a	Okay let me first start off with saying this... This game is NOT worth $20!!!!!!! If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor &amp; wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game &amp; the number of active players grow every day!
2185	0	a	it was good until i was slapped with a VAC ban. i wound up with 0.8 hours on record from starting out, and now I can't even play it online. i did nothing at all, so I wasted the 20-30 bucks for nothing. if you want to play this game, you should do it on console personally, unless you can make a private match and keep hackers out. this one was the best one to me and i feel â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over this.
2186	0	a	Simply one of the best Call of Duty's out there, but this game is nearly broken but the hackers, snipers, and Danger Close noob tubes. Not worth $20 anymore.
2187	0	a	Terible
2188	0	a	Go back to CoD 4 and you'll be good.
2189	0	a	It's a console import. If you own it already on Xbox 360 or PS3 then do NOT buy it on steam. You are better off with Call of Duty 4 because it has PC exclusive features and a bigger community.
2190	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2191	0	a	in my opinion one of the best call of duty games ever made but i dont recommend this game to buy  its because there are not a lot/none playing it...
2192	0	a	MW2 single player is by far the best, but I would avoid if your looking to play online multiplayer unless you enjoy cheating, hacking piece of crap players that still suck even when they cheat...servers are all full of cheating â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ heads that ruin a great game! generation of waste
2193	0	a	I don't really recommend it, But it's up to you all. I played a few days and a few hours. But all i see is Hack servers. Leveling up, people wall hacking, people using cheats to fight there games. There not really doing anything. Just let the aimbot do it for them. I do really miss the fun of the game where it was a challenge, now it's just childs play where people hack there way through. I guess I'll just play on the 360, the only thing I have to worry about is Modded controllers. But I found a way through that, so it's no biggie to play. Just if Punkbuster and other hack shields and stuff were more well equip to handle hacks. I would def. Give this game a 10. But all I see is 2. Half of the game you will mostly find just hack servers. And the rest is just that people are trying to play without having all this trouble. But some want to find hack servers so they wont have to play through. I find alot of unskilled players in this game. But I'll leave it up to you to choose whether this game is for you to play.
2194	0	a	Do not buy if you want it for mac freezes on lowest graphic setigs
2195	0	a	I played the heck out of this way back in the day, but these days there's newer and better games to spend time and money on. Look for one of the newer Call of Duty games or some of the free-to-play games emulating it.
2196	0	a	I can't go back on call of duty modern warfare 2 because they thought I was hacking which I wasn't it might of been 'Cheat Engine 6.4' because I left it running all night
2197	0	a	Game was fun until the removal of the 4D1 client. Now it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. No mods, no FoV slider ingame, just a joke of a PC game.
2198	0	a	Doesn't worth 20$... not at all. Mulitiplayer is full of modded lobbies.
2199	0	a	So I was playing with my friends, and I knew one of my friends were cheating. But I didn't care about what he did and I just wanted to play because it was fun. So after some days he got VAC banned and we laughed at him. And the day after, I got VAC banned too...I have no idea why I got banned. Was it because I played with my friend that cheater or? The only thing I have to say now is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OFF MW2
2200	0	a	If youre gonna buy this for multiplayer, like i did, dont bother now because i played 5 games and every single one had been hacked to extremity and unplayable so STAY THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AWAY!!! Unless you bought it for campaign or spec ops or just generally enjoy having a srsly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed kd and not spawning at all :D Enjoy!
2201	0	a	This game is Good but not great. First off the muliplayer is a mess, in many ways it adds onto and improves on cod4's  mechanics (such as customible killstreaks and pro perks as well as more weapon diversity). But on the other hand you have  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t like one man army noob tubes, commando, deathstreaks, Akimbo G18, and danger close that ruin the games balance and enjoyment.    The single player campaign is good and tells a compelling story but there are some things that aren't well explained and can leav you confused. The spec ops mode is just the campain exept with coop, fun, but doesen't really hold your attention for that long so feel free to skip it. But what hurts this game the most is the optimization, never in my life have I ever seen a game so effortlessly ported to the pc. The game is locked at nauseating 65 FOV (field of view) which will automatically makes the game feel weird to play since you are essenially staring through a pair of binoculars, thankfully there is an FOV changer that you can download for the muliplayer so make sure to get that if you ever plan on getting this game. Plus there are, get this, NO DEDICATED SERVERS.   Yep, no dedicated servers, basic pc features are non exsistent in this game! The lack of dedicated servers is what killed this game, instead of dedicated servers we get a crappy host based matchmaking system where everyone has to leech off of one guys connection meaning if the host has a bad connection you will have to play with laggy hit detection for the rest of the match. Oh and who can forget the oh so wonderful host migrations? Also the game is filled with hacked lobbies up the wazoo and some of them automatically rank you up to level 70 and give you everything ruining most of the replay value. Overall Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a disapointment and don't let any fanboy convince you that it isn't. I wouldn't recommend this game due to the how many asinine descisions were made with the port. But if you are still intrested in getting the game then be my guest, maybe you will be more satisfyed by what you got then I did.
2202	0	a	A decent game made when the iron was still hot unlike the upcomming title advanced warfare. (that game is gonna be bad without an â™¥â™¥â™¥) This game added new kill streak rewards as well as more weapon customization which is not as comlicated as ghost, but still works fine. It was like it predecessor, only more epic and with maps that would become classics. And i must point out that the following titles never had any epic moments such as this game and with more bugs. (Kill streak rewards in this game were alot more rewarding)  But the main reason why i do not recommend this game is the linear campaign which is the formula of all the games in the series, but also that you should not support developers who desperatly try to recycle the old stuff, and add in a dog.   Consumers should be more descicive when ever they buy games. Without the money, talented developers wont be wasted on picking up the broken disc from the garbage bin.
2203	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2204	0	a	Hackers are the most annoying thing, other than that its good. There are many hackers Always ruin the game.
2205	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this to many moders
2206	0	a	Guys i Download this game but how i change language from russia to english Pls need help
2207	0	a	They needed controller support
2208	0	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2209	0	a	It Keeps Saying Cheat Detected For No Reason... FIX IT!!!!
2210	0	a	I avoided this noobfest for a long time. I don't like Activision and don't want to support them financially. Along with EA, they are all that's wrong with the gaming industry. Finally, when it was $5 on sale, and I had done my google research to find that you COULD play on dedicated servers thanks to a community made mod. So I gave in and bought it. But then Activision decided that it was not OK for people to play their game on better servers, and shut it down. I should have known better.
2211	0	a	The game is very fun and an older cod that brings back memories... But the multiplayer system is hacked. I would have about 80 hours right now... but I just wasted my money buying a game that doesn't have multiplayer. If you are in a lobby with hackers, you'll most likely get banned. I could go on but this isn't worth it.
2212	0	a	i do not recommend this game, because in multiplayer there could be a hacked server resulting in unlocking EVERYTHING, for some people its AWESOME, but not to me because it just ruins the point in multiplayer with unlocking everything altogether, so i would like a refund because of that, thats the reason for MY refund
2213	0	a	Shooter on rails
2214	0	a	no server browser so cant play mods well. also you join some american servers so the internet cant keep up and ping is bad
2215	0	a	Pretty hight price for a forgotten child of IW. Game has no dedicated servers and instead they run on a players connection. Every match lags and host changes are frequent. I still play it cause of the nostalgia.
2216	0	a	Thanks for getting me vac banned. Although i didn't use any cheat :) because i joined a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hacked lobby so i am banned.. -_-
2217	0	a	I would love to say a must have... but this makes CoD4 looks seperior. And the Yearly-New CoD game destroys this franchise.
2218	0	a	WTF How is this still selling for $20.. Go pick up a copy of BF3 for free.
2219	0	a	As a CoD veteran (CoD, CoD:GO, CoD 2, CoD:MW, CoD:WaW), i was VERY disapointed with this game once i played it for the first time. And im still a bit disapointed every time i load it. Activision tried to be a hipster and killed actual servers the thing every FPS so far was OK with. But no... Activision have to make changes, even destroy dedicated servers in order to look like they're doing something out there. That step was a TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING MISTAKE. And unspeakable disgrace. With one move they destroyed MW:2. Still its a great COPY of a game, after a while you can get used to the damn thing.
2220	0	a	5/10 Okay game in my opinion at the time. It did not do much to stand out with all the shooters that came out around the same time frame. For that it got 'average'. I prefer the realism and gameplay of Battlefield over this shooter. There are newer versions out there so I (if this was the only option for me) would skip this and get the newer CoD that has more 'realism' and overall better feel. Plus more people are playing online on the newer one and more players = better match making leading to a happier gamer :)
2221	0	a	made me realise just how much better console gaming online is. PC gamer's will never understand how crippled their online gaming experience is compared to consoles in the competitive heartbeat shooter genre.   Games like this, Halo and Gears back in the xbox 360 days were far ahead of their time when it came to accessability [leaderboards, bonus perks, prestiege] and the tools needed for effective communication [party chat, all mics in game] were certainly there unlike the pc.   More importantly, it just feels like a quick console port, a downgraded product of what it should have been and that's exactly what it is.  It's puzzling that for a platform with superior hardware for the same game, the experience is just so miles apart. Console gaming really is better for online shooters. This game is by far one example of that.   Console Gaming- 1  PC hardware- 0
2222	0	a	Hitscan Russian and his 20 identical copies jump out from behind a barrel for a huge party. 1/10
2223	0	a	This game is absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, too much hackers, campers and people that spray with G18s... I recommend people to buy ArmA or Battlefield instead of any of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ CoDs
2224	0	a	It's full fo hackers and good luck getting a refund... f**k this game.
2225	0	a	Ingame Settings are so bad you can't change FOV or open console, its locked at what looks like 55 making unplayable while sitting at a deks
2226	0	a	Game is crud. Reported to the FBI. 10/10. I wouldn't even waste one hour on this pile of crud.
2227	0	a	Okay let me first start off with saying this... This game is NOT worth $20!!!!!!! If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor &amp; wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game &amp; the number of active players grow every day!
2228	0	a	Keeps crashing its a peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
2229	0	a	don't make the same mistake i did nobody plays this game on multiplayer anymore so basically all you have is a 3 hour campaign and special ops that basically suck
2230	0	a	it was good until i was slapped with a VAC ban. i wound up with 0.8 hours on record from starting out, and now I can't even play it online. i did nothing at all, so I wasted the 20-30 bucks for nothing. if you want to play this game, you should do it on console personally, unless you can make a private match and keep hackers out. this one was the best one to me and i feel â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over this.
2231	0	a	I sunk an unhealthy amount of time into this game and truly enjoyed the competitive nature of it. Unfortunately the game became overrun with cheaters and Activision seemed more interested in churning out DLC rather than fix the problem. Because of that I cannot recommend this game and in fact have never played a COD game again.
2232	0	a	dont buy this barely anyone play this and there are sometimes modder and there no mods to make this game better
2233	0	a	U can get banned randomly permantly when u did nothing wrong i dont recorment it
2234	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2235	0	a	It was fun till the moderaters start to kick players with tubes and other stuff now I don't like it that mutch anymore
2236	0	a	'still rocks. no ded. servers but still better than BlackOps.' - Thats been my Review... until now.  Dont get me wrong, this game is awesome and I love playing Multiplayer. Oh wait. I loveD. But since they sued 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥net' and '4deltaone', which did a pretty great job with developing some modification for this game (New Gamemodes, New Maps, Dedicated Servers...) it just got horrible.  Sorry InfinitiyWard - but your policies really suck. No one buys this game anymore. No one plays it anymore. So why do you even care if somebody makes it playable for the last remaining fans?  'Black Ops' was the last CoD I bought after MW2 - and I did regret it - it felt like playing in mud... But those lawsuits against 4deltaone make it clear: CoD is dead (for me!), I will switch to Battlefield, DayZ and ArmA. R.I.P. CoD, its been a great time. ;)
2237	0	a	It is a good game, but i can never get in a lobby with out a hacker! way to many hackers, the MOST u should get it for is around $10 $15. 6.5/10
2238	0	a	Well the story was deacent. My biggest problem with the game is that in any given fire fight whoever shoots first will almost always win. there is too much recoil from being shot that there is no chance to get returing fire on the targate. Also, the number of enemies in each fire fight just seems wierd, there are never less than 20 enemies to kill at a time, for one person that is just not right, it makes the game feel fake.
2239	0	a	This game used to be amazing in the past. I'm here to write a more accurate up to date review as of August 2014. This game is complete garbage now, with Call of duty 4 still having 10x the playerbase, this game has a flat 300 players for its playerbase, half the games are still to this day filled with hackers, and not to mention errors that this game comes with as soon as its installed, its a shame this game has gone to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, do not make my mistake and purchase this garbage, if you want something worth your money, call of duy 4 is still an amazing gem.
2240	0	a	Any Call of Duty in the series will tear you apart. How you may ask? Well, Let's just say 'vocab', and rage. That is what I best describe this game. Also, this will tear your family apart as well.
2241	0	a	Got banned, kind of expected this because of all of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hacked lobbys
2242	0	a	Now im banned for nothing really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WORTH PLAYING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OR 3DM GAME THAN BUYING BUT BANNED FOR NOTHING
2243	0	a	The multiplayer is full of hackers. It is also isn't really built for PC gaming in mind.
2244	0	a	Good until hackers ruined it.
2245	0	a	No player s online free-for-all ??!!
2246	0	a	10/10 wouldn't recommend
2247	0	a	I like it, exept this is how it is:  me:Lets play some MW2!!! person: lets play MW2 and make someone mad! me:SOOO CLOOSE TO RANK UP!!!!! person: lets make him max rank! me:NOOOOO!!!!  so... in the end... i am like prestige 5 because of hackers.
2248	0	a	A great game left to decompose.   As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD.
2249	0	a	Better than mw3 multiplayer in all aspects, and if u have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pc is better too, mine works mw3 at 50fps and mw2 in 80 fps, buy it.  30/november/2013: DONT BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, IS FULL OF HACKERS OMG.
2250	0	a	Ingame Settings are so bad you can't change FOV or open console, its locked at what looks like 55 making unplayable while sitting at a deks

2252	0	a	Valve Anti-Cheat enabled :DDD its a joke... lot of cheater, lol respawn system, good game with lot of sux thing.... now ~unplayable:D good game, but now i think i waste 25euro...
2253	0	a	Not Dank enuff for me too hard to 360noscope, not MLG!    But seriously the only people playing are haxors and the game is a poor port.
2254	0	a	The campaign is short and boring with a boring plot and the multiplayer is extremely unbalanced and all the new features break the game furthermore. So you can customize your killstreak loadout, okay but a lot of them are broken and one killstreak is called the Care Package and it takes 3 kills to get. With only 3 kills you can get a freaking AC-130 and cut up the enemy team. The worst killstreak is the nuke as it instantly ends the match. There's a barragement of overpowered and underpowered weapons, the ACR wrecks all enemies and the M16 might as well not be there. The map design is horrid, offering infinite opportunities for camping. There's also deathstreaks which can increase your health, give you your killer's loadout, etc.  Then there's the community; teenagers claiming to have sexual relations with your mother, idiots who tell you to kill yourself because you're the host and the game is laggy without them realizing that the netcode is horrid, people who run around the map quickscoping/trickshotting instead of playing the game, people who intentionally make their loadout overpowered, etc.   It's a blitzkrieg of flawed game design and you shouldn't spend your money on it.
2255	0	a	Even tho its been about forever since I played this poor excuse to be called a game. I still feel I have to report it.... The Multiplayer SUCKS. nothing but lame hackers who are insanly trying to compensate what they are lacking tho I have to stay clean and not say what they are lacking. Even if Hacking isn't the problem... and it, itself is what broke the game... the ridiculous Unbalance and kill streak rewards that are nothing but I win Buttons with stupid over powered AI aircraft and choppers will certainly take anything remotly fun away.  Ofcourse their are alot of people that love that play style which I have to respect. What I can not understand, is how people keep buying these series of COD, expecting them to add some kind of anti hack engine when you know after so many series they havn't and never will. Those people I will always call insane.   I hate this game so badly I wish I can remove this game from my library... NOT ASKING for Refund! I knew I will hate this game when I bought it long time ago... I just did out of peer pressure to play with my friends, so it is clearly my fault for buying it. I just simply want to get rid of it out of my Library permently like I never bought it.
2256	0	a	Not the best game to play if you want to play a FPS. Single player is quite bad and short, multiplayer is a non-strategical mode, just shoot and respawn and shoot more while being shot by 15-y-o kids who are screaming at his mic (and in fact are better at shooting and screaming than you).  Buying it for 25 euros was a waste of money and I regret it. Even if it was 5 euros, I'd be upset.
2257	0	a	Game was fun until the removal of the 4D1 client. Now it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. No mods, no FoV slider ingame, just a joke of a PC game.

2264	0	a	This game is Good but not great. First off the muliplayer is a mess, in many ways it adds onto and improves on cod4's  mechanics (such as customible killstreaks and pro perks as well as more weapon diversity). But on the other hand you have  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t like one man army noob tubes, commando, deathstreaks, Akimbo G18, and danger close that ruin the games balance and enjoyment.    The single player campaign is good and tells a compelling story but there are some things that aren't well explained and can leav you confused. The spec ops mode is just the campain exept with coop, fun, but doesen't really hold your attention for that long so feel free to skip it. But what hurts this game the most is the optimization, never in my life have I ever seen a game so effortlessly ported to the pc. The game is locked at nauseating 65 FOV (field of view) which will automatically makes the game feel weird to play since you are essenially staring through a pair of binoculars, thankfully there is an FOV changer that you can download for the muliplayer so make sure to get that if you ever plan on getting this game. Plus there are, get this, NO DEDICATED SERVERS.   Yep, no dedicated servers, basic pc features are non exsistent in this game! The lack of dedicated servers is what killed this game, instead of dedicated servers we get a crappy host based matchmaking system where everyone has to leech off of one guys connection meaning if the host has a bad connection you will have to play with laggy hit detection for the rest of the match. Oh and who can forget the oh so wonderful host migrations? Also the game is filled with hacked lobbies up the wazoo and some of them automatically rank you up to level 70 and give you everything ruining most of the replay value. Overall Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a disapointment and don't let any fanboy convince you that it isn't. I wouldn't recommend this game due to the how many asinine descisions were made with the port. But if you are still intrested in getting the game then be my guest, maybe you will be more satisfyed by what you got then I did.
2265	0	a	I like to be somewhat aware of what's going on in gaming, and this is the biggest series of them all, but the premise of this is beyond stupid. Not to mention it's like a ride at a theme park - lots to look at, but just keep running...
2266	0	a	I would give the game a good and honest opinion on it, however there are too many hackers that aren't being taken care of. You either get kicked or get all your perks and weapons demoted. Unless you really enjoy the game and is willing to earn all your guns and perks back after getting demoted at least once a week, then this is the game for you.
2267	0	a	amazing single player and fun multiplayer!  edit: full of hackers these days 7/10
2268	0	a	R.I.P COD, this was the last good game that came out and was ruined by the stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s who hacked and programmed it
2269	0	a	Keep firing, @$$holes!
2270	0	a	One of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest games I've ever been conned into buying by the 'review' industry.
2271	0	a	Multiplayer is broken, don't bother. They're not going to fix it any time soon. If you play CoD games solely for the single player campaign, then whatever, but if you play CoD just for the multiplayer, you'll find that you'll enter a hacked lobby and you'll have your UI messed up and that the game will be totally unplayable and it won't matter if you reinstall the game because the problem will persist.
2272	0	a	I always loved MW2 yet on PC it isn't good. I would reccomend this game to someone when it first came out but now just save your money. Almost every game you join there is a hacker in the lobby ruining the game. I was hoping to play it legitly but that was not going to happen. The minute I left I was 10th Prestige and level 70. Ontop of that this game issued a VAC ban on my profile for 'cheating'. The reason being is that I installed a custom weapon camo. Nobody else could see it so it was only changing my expirience, not theirs. Its funny how all the millions of hackers on this game get off the hook for hosting lobbies and using aimbot and the minute I use a simple weapon camo I am banned. From a game that came out in 2009 VAC bans should really be a thing of the past. If you want the game for the campaign go ahead but forget about the multiplayer. Its time is over and now modders are in every lobby.
2273	0	a	Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a 2009 first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The game is a sequel of the hit game, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare however it did not live up to the original. In my opinion the franchise started to do very poorly from here. Every COD game started to feel like copies with different maps and guns but the same engine. One of the biggest issues were that if you got a certain amount of kills in a row you can nuke the game and your team wins even if your team was losing and the other team was about to win. In theory it only take the effort of one person to win the round.
2274	0	a	My time played on record only shows single player activity, as STEAM separates the two (single and multiplayer). My total time played in Multiplayer is 970 hours.  Update: Now that the game is infested with hackers, I can no longer recommend it. It isn't a rare to end up in a hacked lobby which will do anything from deranking you to altering your unlocks to changing settings in your mp config file. Playing the game requires keeping backups of all your stats and MP files. More information about this can be found in the forums, so if you are considering the game at this point, be sure to inform yourself about all of the serious issues affecting it. It may not be worth the hassle.  Is the game playable and fun? Sure. And in some instances, when you find a good host and players who want to have an enjoyable time without noob tubes, commando, or other nonsense, it can be really fun. But just beware, it's infested with hacked lobbies, people running exploits, and a less than respectable community. If you can stomach all that, you can find fun in it.  *Original Review:  Quick pacing and nonstop action keeps you moving forward to the inevitable end game of the single player at around a 5 to 8 hour completion time. This is good if you are looking to jump into playing an hour or so at a time as each chapter of the campaign is relatively short. The action on display is compelling and the thrilling score, outstanding militaristic dialogue, and visceral imagery keep things constantly engaging. The story, as epically scaled as it may be, is a little too contrived. Modern Warfare 2 decides to up the ante with a full scale invasion of the United States. The U.S. is under siege and the stakes are high. It is unfortunate then that the reasoning behind the whole ordeal, while tragic, is somewhat farfetched. The multiplayer is excellent, yes, with superb shooter mechanics and fluid gameplay. It is also somewhat rage inducing. Prepare to be noob tubed to kingdom come. That aside, it is fast and great fun.
2275	0	a	Tp be real I have no idea why they say this is the best cod game of all time, maybe in sales. The game is ok, the multiplayer is crap because everyone is cheating, and not just a little, a whole lot, and no one gets kicked,to me it is the worst call of duty ever.
2276	0	a	What was I thinking?!
2277	0	a	Good Game  Edit: NOT! Noobtuber and campers everywere
2278	0	a	says its for mac but cant play it??? 
2279	0	a	Got into a hacked lobby, got VAC banned
2280	0	a	Multiplayer is 12-year-olds and hackers that think it's fun to mod in low gravity and infinite ammo.
2281	0	a	if anyone asked me for couple of years ago, Ill be recommend it to others, now I dont, too many cheaters in this game, and for sure its really sad, cuz its actually a pretty good game, too bad with the cheating stuff..!
2282	0	a	This is my favorite game. But I allowed my friend to control my computer over an application and he gave me hacks for the game. I did not want them he said it'll be a surprise. I was then VAC Banned for somehthing I did not do. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you steam.
2283	0	a	Requires almost no skill and is riddled with DLC and probably still is with hackers.  If you've played one of them, you've played all of them. Save yourself the grenade spam and skip CoD. There are far better games in this genre and recent CoD/Battlefield titles are definitely not one of them.
2284	0	a	I played the heck out of this way back in the day, but these days there's newer and better games to spend time and money on. Look for one of the newer Call of Duty games or some of the free-to-play games emulating it.
2285	0	a	The best COD game I've played. Singleplayer is great, but the multiplayer sucks, just about everyone hacks in one way or another, and most games are modified or changed in some way. Waste of money.
2286	0	a	I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.
2287	0	a	not nice you kan kill my brothers in it.....
2288	0	a	Why did I let myself play so much of this game? Man, I was a f*ckin' dumb teenager.    0 out of 360 no-scopes. 
2289	0	a	The PC Port for this game is TERRIBLE!  1.Thanks to it now having the match making system, you can get put in hacked lobbies, which happens a lot! 2:There are no dedicated servers which means if you want to make a server for everyone to join, can't do that anymore 3:There is no more Server Browser, which means you can't choose what game to join, which means you can't join a non hacked game I mean the game is fun and all when you not in a hacked lobby, but with these 3 main problems, I just really can't enjoy this game. Overall Rating 5/10 If this were the Console Verison 8/10
2290	0	a	This is a pitifully disgusting game now. ruined by hackers and little kids. hell both i should say. shameless lag switchers, aimbotters, wallhackers, hacked servers. Hackers killed this franchise because they have no skills and choose hacks to be better. No hackers you will never be better, if you use hacks you are less of a person and skills will always be better than hacks. and btw, you are not a hacker just because you use hacks, the person who made the hacks is a hacker, you are just subhuman scum in the gutters of forgotten humanity. if i was a zillionaire *even if that was a money amount* id buy this fncking franchise and set it straight, bring back up dedicated servers, update it with the latest hack defenses, idk theres sh!t out there. if it wasnt for hackers and little kids this would still be The Number One FPS shooter of all time. yes. im not exaggerating. But it is nice to find that one rare match where no one is actually hacking and its a non hacked lobby and acceptable connection, thats when the beauty of the game truly shines through. i dont recommend you buy this game, but you can if you want. i just bought it for old times sake because i had it on PS3.
2291	0	a	When I was younger I really enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the campaign. I enjoyed the multiplayer. I enjoyed the guns. Everything. I guess I grew up, because now the linear campaign feels claustrophobic to the point that it's not remotely enjoyable. The multiplayer still has all the same problems that made people ragequit years ago. Crappy spawn system, terrible hitboxes, ridiculous kill streaks, annoying death streaks, and so much more. I will say that the multiplayer maps themselves are very memorable and it feels good revisiting them. To conclude I don't think this game is worth the 20$ price tag. There are so many better games on here with more to offer that cost less than 20$. So yeah, my opinion.
2292	0	a	another crap fps, you dont need half brain to play it, just jump around with akimbo shooting everything and you will rule! cheater dominate this game.  can I delete it from my library?

2298	0	a	If you want to play the MP just don't. Most but not all lobbys are hacked. It is really hard to get into a lobby that is not hacked. To me the story is good. There are a desent amount of weapon. Good game. But if you want it due to MP DON'T BUY IT.

2307	0	a	The game is very fun and an older cod that brings back memories... But the multiplayer system is hacked. I would have about 80 hours right now... but I just wasted my money buying a game that doesn't have multiplayer. If you are in a lobby with hackers, you'll most likely get banned. I could go on but this isn't worth it.
2308	0	a	i do not recommend this game, because in multiplayer there could be a hacked server resulting in unlocking EVERYTHING, for some people its AWESOME, but not to me because it just ruins the point in multiplayer with unlocking everything altogether, so i would like a refund because of that, thats the reason for MY refund
2309	0	a	I avoided this noobfest for a long time. I don't like Activision and don't want to support them financially. Along with EA, they are all that's wrong with the gaming industry. Finally, when it was $5 on sale, and I had done my google research to find that you COULD play on dedicated servers thanks to a community made mod. So I gave in and bought it. But then Activision decided that it was not OK for people to play their game on better servers, and shut it down. I should have known better.
2310	0	a	A great game, that is completely unmonitored, with hackers in most lobbies with the ability to change your rank and remove all of the weapons you've unlocked. It's a broken game now, don't buy it if you want it for multiplayer.
2311	0	a	nahh seriously it sucks
2312	0	a	Single player very good, Multiplayer HACK CITY. Is terrrible, steam does not care, publisher does not care, do not get it.
2313	0	a	I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.  Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:  It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience.   While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public Â£100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.  This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned.
2314	0	a	Got into a modded lobby, got prestige 10, level 70 and EVERYTHING unlocked, and then got VAC banned, wouldn't recommend to anyone
2315	0	a	Nobody plays it................
2316	0	a	Honestly don't buy it if you want to get a lot of time out of it and play multiplayer. Youtubers and reviews all said that multiplayer has a ton of hackers that will hurt your steam/computer and even some take out all exit functions. So I didn't play multiplayer, which is a large part of the game. I got about 10 hours out of this game before getting bored of it, and five of which were campaign and the other five special ops. Campaign is much better. Special ops is pretty fun, but it can be annoying trying to get new missions by playing the ones you hate. Overall, save the $20 and go buy Cs:go or Cod4 (which has multiplayer thats not hacked as much)
2317	0	a	Back in the day I would have suggested this game. I spent crazy hours playing Multiplayer Online. It's such a shame that the PC version multiplayer is dead now. I hear that Xbox is still alive. The single player was fun but short. Bad Company 2 was my next FPS and I enjoyed the single player more.         RATE:   3 OUT OF 10     
2318	0	a	The lack of dedicated servers really hurts the game, if you get into a hacked lobby you'll get VAC banned, plus nobody plays it, if you plan to buy this, please don't; if you are doing it for 'da ztory', just get another shooty game with a good story (may I recommend Bioshock Infinite?).  tl;dr fon't buy this, ever.
2319	0	a	This is where Call of Duty began its long decline. Single player (as most of the game in this series) is good and fascinating and multiplayer HAD its good moments (TDM and S&amp;D) but the matchmaking system is really bad. As soon as Black Ops got released this game pretty much died and survives only with hackers dominating servers. I would buy this game now only for &lt;10â‚¬ for its single player part (if you liked Call of Duty 4, which is still largely played and the best Call of Duty ever in my opinion)
2320	0	a	do not buy MW2 if you want to play multiplayer thar to tuns of hackers i onley played 5 hours and got my leveo hacked 2 time and was in mor than 10 hacked lobbys i wood not buy MW2 for multiplayer

2325	0	a	In my opinion? Not worth the money
2326	0	a	Lobbies have nothing but hackers. If your looking for the game you played on your 360/  Ps3 then this is not it. It's just hackers, who can't be killed. Infinite health, 1 shot kill water guns. If you like hackers here's your game. If they annoy you then do not purchase this game.
2327	0	a	To be totally honest, this game is not worth the money. Even on sale it's not worth it at all. The multiplayer is FULL of hackers. The only thing that's fun is the campain and the special ops but that can only last you so long. You join a game in multiplayer and you get all this op stuff... It takes away the fun and experience in leveling up. So you should hold on to your money and wait for another game you want to go on sale. Hope this helped '')
2328	0	a	first of all, COD on Steam? nope. dont bother &gt;-&lt; there are hackers evreyehere. its a hacker paradise. just get this game on xbox 360 and its not bad. mW2 is a decent game, but not on steam. the campaign is playable and spec-ops is pointless scince you cant unlock any other missions ._. oh and   Xxx_MLGFaZeCLAN360PU$$YDESTROYER_xxX  dont forget the dew and doritos.
2329	0	a	single player thumbs up co-op thumbs up multi-player lan thumbs up  Multi-player with Valve's anti cheat two thumbs down. The multitude of cheaters and hackers that run rampat on there servers leaves me with no faith in any of steams anti cheat systems. If at very least you had the ability to ban a person to letting join a game your in, you could at least avoid some of them.  Can happen often you join a hacked server, leave it trying to find another game and you join right back into the same server. Valves anti-cheat says it bans cheaters and catchest them however many times its very obvious the cheaters are there and wrecking any entertainment you would have. Unfortunatly if you wish to play lan games and you would like to use more then the basic weapons attachments perks etc. you are forced to play with these poor servers and players with hacks and cheats running. Some of these hacks are minor however most are disruptive (like people deciding to summon boxes and create walls or houses, others try to not be so obvious only using target assist creating multiple increadable kills only seen in movies, some of these are hard to determine because some good players abound with impressive kills and you have to experience multiple incredable deaths untill you can assume there is some hack running. The worst is when someone hijacks a server creating bizzare events of people jumping increadable heights and weapon crates falling from the sky.  The old school way of allowing people to host and control there own network games was far superior there you would be able save servers that were running things fair or in settings you appreciate, and the server controllers could at will ban players they felt were not following there own rules and or seamed to be cheating.  Valves attempt at elliminating cheaters is iether forgotten about with this old game, which leaves me wondering if any of the newer games I may be on the fence of purchasing is worth the hassel of purchasing.  the VAC and forced playing multiple online games before it open weapon options during lan are the only negative to this game,

2337	0	a	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was the most popular Call of Duty of all time. It has an engaging campaign and the visuals at the time were top notch. But its glory days have passed. The multiplayer is riddled with hacks and it is almost impossible to find an unhacked server. So if you are looking at this game for the multiplayer then I would look elsewhere. If you are looking at this then I would wait until the price drops but until then I cannot recommend this game simply because of its age and non working service.
2338	0	a	This game is good in gameplay and all that stuff, but there is one thing that makes the game unplayable, hackers.  Now, I'm not talking about aimbot or some lame exuse when I get killed or something like that. I'm talking about LEGIT hackers/moders.   Almost EVERY multi player server you go on, it will be hacked. I can't even PLAY the game anymore because some hacker put this GIANT MAP in the middle of my screen! Even if I restart the game it's still there.  They also have acess to your LOADOUTS too, and some hacker took ALL my items from me.  Would I recommend this? Well, maybe. If you don't mind all the hacking and taking away all your items and giant maps on the screen. Just maybe.
2339	0	a	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was good when it came out.  Now it is just sad. With all those hackers and their hack servers sending you to prestige 10, when you wanna level up yourself and earn all those things.  i managed to get prestige 4 before getting into a hacked server which turned me into prestige 10.  So i've done my fair share of resetting. But then i got tired of resetting every now and then and eventually stopped playing.  Back in the day i would score it 10/10 but today i will probably score it 3/10
2340	0	a	The multi-player is hacked to pieces. If you don't have enough friends to host your own site, forget about it.

2344	0	a	Great game dont get me wrong! I love this and would still be playing.. But stupid hackers are every where! My friend is now banned from modern warfare 2 because we were in a hacked lobby. YES, the hacker was fine, but not the innocent.. such bull****. He didnt hack yet he was banned. Good job VAC!!!!!!!!!! GOOD F****** JOB. Good game, non existent, I Bought it for PS3 recently too and hackers are there too. Sadly not worth the money
2345	0	a	This game is broken multiplayer is full of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! and players are idiots they make this game full of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ everybody are using guns what are OP like G18 akimbo Granade launcher and that is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ridiculus and this game is full of hackers dont buy this if u rage much
2346	0	a	Valve Anti-Cheat decided to ban me from the game because some a**hole decided to change my stats after I was put in a multiplayer modded-lobby. Come on Valve, get your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together. Now I have this annoying VAC ban on my record when I literally never did anything. What a mess.
2347	0	a	With nearly a thousand hours played in Singleplayer and Multiplayer it makes me sad to give this a negative review now. I loved this game. I used to play this all f****n day long after school with my friends and even made new friends.   It used to be the best game I ever played but now it's literally dead except for hackers, campers and ofcourse trolls. To bad that the newer games don't give the same feeling like this one did. I guess it's time to say goodbye and finally uninstall it.  May my memory of this game stay always in my mind and the pure joy that I felt, shall stay in my heart. RIP &lt;/3
2348	0	a	+Co-Op  -Re used maps from 'old' cod 'games'  +Singleplayer takes some time to complete.  -Get's repedetive.  -Still no FoV option. -Server browser is only avible if you cracked your game wich is not legal. (Makes me wonder why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pirates get's the beter Version?!?!)  
2349	0	a	do not buy, even though this game is amazing. the online is unplayable due to the lack of players. 90% of the time you will join hack matches, i really wish the devs could do something about the hackers. but they are no going to do that beacause its an 'old game'. i recommend this game for the story. :(
2350	0	a	I liked the multiplayer very much, played it for many hours.  But the host system and the resulting hacker overrun ruined everything.  So at last I cannot recommend getting this any longer.
2351	0	a	Full of Hackers and Hacked Lobbies
2352	0	a	Hackers everywhere you go.
2353	0	a	this game has a lot of hacker so no i dont recommend this game
2354	0	a	The multiplayer is a hacker ridden graveyard. Do not spend your money on this.
2355	0	a	so many hackers
2356	0	a	Fun for a while, but the community isn't as great compared to other fps games. Community is lacking compared to the CS series.
2357	0	a	Used to be a great game, Multiplayer that is. Now its just crap and full of stupid mods. Its no fun anymore.
2358	0	a	Well the bad thing is there are so MANY hackers and if they get VAC Ban, they just make new account and share their library.. so they can get back on and hack again easily so I think the anti cheat should work better to stop the hackers from ruining the game I stopped playing MW2 and barely play it because of hackers. GOOD THING: It's cheap, great game but just too many hackers. Hope this helped. If you get this game I recommend just playing single player and on servers with no hackers.
2359	0	a	Yes I am a little behind the times , its a old game . But the people that play this game are the most rude and racisit assbags I have ever met . I play two games on steam so far , killing floor which by far has the most likeable players I have ever met , even made friends with a few but this game , I really regret buying it . Oh it had great graphics , but that is about it . Way to confusing for a first timer plus no way that I found so far to balance the game play . I get tossed into a game with level 70 players I may as well just stay in one spot and be target practice . Maybe MW3 is better but I do not think the price on either of these games just because of the community is worth it . If I want abuse I will go and find a girlfriend into bondage , not some 20 something neckbeard who had played the game forever . Just wish I vould get my money back .
2360	0	a	Singleplayer: Awesome, amazing story  Muletiplayer: take 10 minutes to find a server
2361	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. A LOT OF HACKERS! Buy battlefield bad company 2 instead of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.
2362	0	a	This Call of Duty was the first step downward, and it sunk every year, even more and more.
2363	0	a	huge disappointment from CoD4: Modern warfare.
2364	0	a	Seems like a good game but it keeps on crashing with my Radeon HD7870 card with Windows 10.
2365	0	a	meh, good game, too many cheaters
2366	0	a	For it's $20 dollar price tag it's probably one of the best choices for Call of Duty's out there. The main problem being is that there's a large amount of hackers in the game, or hacked lobbies. Still, you you want an occasional Call of Duty game to play, this might be a good pick up.
2367	0	a	Single Player:   Pros:  Simple. Clean. Fun. Fun missions that are well designed and complex. Game mechanics are an improvement compared to COD 4.  Cons:  Terrible Storyline. Get's boring. I can only play it for like 45 minutes in one sitting until I get bored out of my mind.   Multiplayer: Just terrible frankly, almost no one plays it anymore and the ones that do are all hackers. No point in playing it.  Conclusion: Decent game, but you're probably better off playing a different COD, such as Black Ops or any of the more recent ones (Ghosts, Advanced Warfare), or waiting for BO3 which looks pretty damn good.  Overall - 6.5/10
2368	0	a	This game was piece of art when it first came out, so many improvements from Call of Duty 4. The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 was an absolute masterpiece, you continue on from Call of Duty 4, playing as different branches, with different characters, though this game does have it's moments being a bit repetative later on in the game but something new always pops up to give you a boost of interest, the graphics for this game are amazing, huge step up from COD4, the AI is improved but still has it's moments where it is completely unintelligent and has no regard for itself, animations are great, many weapons throughout the campaign to choose from, the singplayer earns a 9/10. As for the multiplayer I cannot say the same, let me start off saying that Modern Warfare 2 is only worth playing for it's singeplayer due to the fact that the multiplayer is full of hackers all day everyday, and you can risk being deranked in a specific server, that goes with saying you can be at risk for a VAC ban for claims of cheating, the multiplayer is nice and all, lot's of intense fighting, however the hackers are the main reason why multiplayer is ruined for this, so I do not recommend this game for it's multiplayer.
2369	0	a	Beware bloody game won't let me bloody finish its Endgame; and in effect its Single Player.
2370	0	a	I CANT PLAY ONLINE i have windows 10 and a beast pc yet still just says not responding and black screen what the hell is going on
2371	0	a	This game was really good then i figuered out that they used the ending in the beginning of ghost
2372	0	a	too many hackers and noob tubes in this game and all the legit players can do nothing about it because valve is too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid to fix the game to ban hackers
2373	0	a	The community i just full of people who are old to this game so i reccomend that you dont buy this game after 2013 because youll just keep getting deathstreaks
2374	0	a	Note: the following is about the single-player version. I don't play multiplayer so cannot comment on it. If you're buying it for the multiplayer, look at other reviews. If you're considering buying it for the single player, this review is meant for you. FYI.  It's so scripted that there is little to no replayability unless you enjoy doing exactly the same thing over and over and are enamoured with learning what is effectively an elaborate dance routine (shoot there, spin around, shoot there, move 2 meters, shoot there, etc.). So $/hr of enjoyment is limited. Lucky I only buy these things at massive discount Steam sales.  Overall storyline is strained. On the plus side, many of the missions are somewhat entertaining the first time around. Some are annoying as hell, apparently made to simply annoy the player, or perhaps showcase a particular element that the developers were particular proud of. None made me think 'wow, that was great'. The ending was, as with CoD4:MW, an annoying as hell tightly scripted cutscene.  Will I get the CoD:MW3? Probably, but only at a massive discount (ie: under CDN$10). Because so far the series isn't worth more than that. But for $10, it's an OK buy.  PS: You can't even turn off the repetive music. Instead, you'll have it blaring your ears while you TRY to listen for the killer dogs approaching, or footsteps behind you. There are ways to turn it off by hacking the system (well, renaming a file) but that compromises the local file integrity. Go figure.  PPS: Having now tried the multiplayer, my opinion doesn't change. The main issue is their idea of 'server selection'. As in: you don't get a choice. You are connected to the first server it finds, and servers are user-operated so anything can happen. The system does not offer a list of available servers. So if you're in a group you don't want to play with (ie: they've hacked the server so much it's useless), you're stuck, because that's the first one the game will find. Alternative services have been aggressively shut down by the distributor for some reason. As for gameplay, it's the usual mix of perfectly reasonable people with an unfortunate leavening of cheaters.   PPPS: Oh, and if you want to play around in single player, expect a LOT of issues trying to get the console working, and keeping it working. It was working, I 'resumed' a game, and now it's not working any more. Yes, I've made all the necessary changes to config.cfg, yes I've made config.cfg read-only so the damn game doesn't overwrite it with a stored copy (why in HELL have a config.cfg if there's a stored copy, I'll never understand), but it still won't bloody work. ANNOYED! Doesn't change my recommendation though, my opinion of the game was already low.  Definitely not at all recommended unless you get this game at a steep, steep discount.
2375	0	a	Great for a call of duty game, but compared to good games it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2376	0	a	Multiplayer is riddled with hackers. 9/10 would not advise to play.
2377	0	a	would recommend this game but, untalented/unskillful people, use noobtubes and rpgs. some people play normally, but people use rpgs and noobtubes to carry them to max prestige. ffs
2378	0	a	I would like to update my old review from back in 2014 in January 1st.  I'll keep it short by saying that I wouldn't recommend this game.  The singleplayer is fun but what most people are probably after is the multiplayer which this game is not-so-great with - maybe back when it first came out?  I find I'm lagging constantly (with good internet) and the game also seems to crash a lot telling me there are 'file mismaches' to which I've gone and fixed with the validation of game files to which the game STILL tells me that I have mismatched files.
2379	0	a	The start of the decent of Call of Duty...

2385	0	a	Filled with whiny â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with no grasp on ''fun''. They just want 3 digits on their kill column. This might have been fun at it's prime but now it's just cancer.
2386	0	a	No dedicated server support in multiplayer. Not only does this mean there is virtually no ability to play on custom user created maps (unless you play locally) but it means you get put in games with no attention to connection issues, skill level or map choice. This one thing alone ruined it for me. If this doesn't bother you I'd say it's a great game, all of what you'd expect from the COD series. Haven't gotten much into the single player campaign yet but what I've played has been pretty decent.

2391	0	a	Simple review, dont buy. Old game that is only played by noobs who just camp and do nothing to play the game. Only game mode played is TDM, which id ont mind but it sucks when you try to get into the foray only to be shot in the back by a guy corner camping. Oh and no lean ability, Infinity Ward removed it because a minority of the gaming community hated it cause the campers couldnt camp with it. Unbalanced perks, weapons and equipment like the UMP45 getting a massive boost with the suppressor and OMA giving unlimited grenade ammo for the noob tube and such. Hacking is still present though most people using it will hide it by pulling it out limitedly and the fact that VAC no longer bans players from the game which basically makes the game now garbage. Hosting is archaic with having a player host in a sort of LAN based gaming which you dont control, its like console gaming on a PC. If you have latency to the host expect to lose alot of .. everything gunfights, matches and basically even when you shoot guys in the back expect that to fail when it doesnt register and you still die. Even being host doesnt guarantee anything since you can still lag when hosting too. No control over the game, no lean ability, no hacker counter equals a game that can still be fun when played with none of the above stuff but when there are hackers and such expect a broken match and to top if off if you leave it will count as a loss and then they will toss you right back into the same match as icing on the cake.
2392	0	a	Multiplayer is riddled with hackers. 9/10 would not advise to play.
2393	0	a	would recommend this game but, untalented/unskillful people, use noobtubes and rpgs. some people play normally, but people use rpgs and noobtubes to carry them to max prestige. ffs
2394	0	a	As my first COD game on a computer I disliked it. For fans of the series I guess it's pretty good though.
2395	0	a	Try to think of the most fun you've had playing this game in the past with a group of friends or alone. Chilling out on the couch or at the computer and playing. Now try to imagine a bunch of tryhards noob tubing, head-glitching, and camping â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all of the casual fun out of your game without any VAC protection and a missing map since 2012. Well thats whats left on MW2 on the PC now. So keep your happy memories of this game and dont re-buy it out of nostalgia.
2396	0	a	Can't say this game is all that great anymore. The single campaign is just not gripping and lasts 5 or 6 hours at best. There are still some people playing multiplayer, but you're SOL if you want to play anything other than Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Search and Destroy. Really only pick this up if you have nostalgia from playing it on an old console.
2397	0	a	So i had some fun with this in multiplayer... until i joined a server and quickly realized it was hacked and i then notice im level 70... so yeah that ruined a big chunk of the game for me and apperantly it happens alot due to my friends first game was hacked from what i know there is no way to avoid these servers but you can always prestige when you stumble upon a hacked server.. However this is not the end i suppose i can still find some enjoyment out of the game after all it is call of duty even if i wish i could get my 10 dollars back... would recomend this game on xbox and play station Not pc
2398	0	a	Hackers, do i have to say any more?
2399	0	a	good game but lot of hackers. 
2400	0	a	People still play 4 Game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Hardcore Team Deathmatch and Domination (sometimes you can find Search &amp; Destroy but not usually). Most of the time you won't have a problem with TDM but any other game mode you will be waiting several minutes for Steam to setup a lobby and when you get one it will likely be laggy. I got this game on sale for 10 bucks a couple weeks ago and it was worth it... But I would definitely not recommend paying 20 bucks for this game unless you only like Team Deathmatch.   Oh, and it is full of hackers. If you can deal with people shooting you through walls when they shouldn't even know you're there then this one's for you! I would actually guess that AT LEAST 7/10 people are actually cheating in this game. Since the anti-cheat engine is disabled they don't even try to hide it anymore. Never seen such blatantly obvious hacks in a game before. I rate this game ***Fart noise*** out of 10.  UPDATE! Reverted to Windows 7, had to reinstall the game. Won't even run in Windows 7. I am not converting back to Windows 10 just to play MW2. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY and don't buy this junk.
2401	0	a	good game BUT the minus are unbearable to ignore  -no vote system (kick,change map,ect) -full of hackers,noob tubers,kids with mental problems -no dedicated servers -no bots -expensive dlc's  ther are 'mods' out ther in the net that allows you to use vote system,dedicated servers,bots to play agenst BUT the developers are like 'dont give a f' they hunt down every modder that tryis to fix the damn game and make it better. ok i understand you dont like pirate version of the game,but this is the only way to fix this mesh,and is the only way becose you the develpers just dont give a f about the game!  how dificult it would be to just add this option to the game? if simple modders can do it,you can do it. BUT NOOO you just dont care about your game..full with hackers! you got your money so you dont care about us.  yea let them buy our new cod's, forget about mw2.NO NO NO!!! i wont buy nothing until you fix this mesh.  i mean EA Games its hated for many things we all know that.but its seams that they are not the only ones that need to be hated.for me you are just the same,you dont give a f for the players that suported you when you needed the money.  and i will say it again,HOW HARD IS TO IMPLEMENT THIS OPTIONS IN YOUR DAMN GAME?????   (sorry for my english)
2402	0	a	too many cheaters
2403	0	a	Got VAC banned for random connect to hacked server GG
2404	0	a	full of cheaters unfortunately.
2405	0	a	I hate this game, but liked it when i was 14
2406	0	a	Great game back in the day(Review doesnt show it but I have approx. 600 hours on multiplayer), is now a ghost town and run by hackers. Get it on console, you can get a pre-owned copy for less than 3 pounds, has *way* more players on it and less hacker while this still costs 20 pounds.  On a side note, the single player visuals hold up extremely well.
2407	0	a	It's Call of Duty...what more to say, just pick up a controller and play...if you can get past the 13 year olds yelling at your ear and giving your mom regards...:/
2408	0	a	Seems like a good game but it keeps on crashing with my Radeon HD7870 card with Windows 10.
2409	0	a	After first part I was expecting a lot from this, but DISSAPOINTED I was.... very.
2410	0	a	The best COD amongst all in my opinion but the PC version lacks many features in comparison to PS3/360 versions:  - Full controller support. - 2 local player Special Ops using split screen. - 4 local Multiplayer using split screen.  Call of Duty is, problably, the most expensive franchise ever. Many companies updated their games to the new demand and Activision didn't. Activision say that these updates in PC have many technical difficulties, come on...  I'm hopeless about a major update in COD:MW2, so I don't recommend this game because the high prize of this game (even on sale!) doesn't represent the real quality of the game (with respect to PS3/360).
2411	0	a	Black screen on widows XP I canÂ´t launch it!!!
2412	0	a	Worse in every way compared to its predecessor.
2413	0	a	do not buy this game after you play for a while the game will not run and i will not get of you desc top dont wast your money
2414	0	a	Can't play with my friends online because of a bug. (which will never be fixed)
2415	0	a	Endless crashes (only game that does that) + not as good as CoD4: Modern Warfare (not even close).  Score: 70 (Okay)
2416	0	a	I bought this for the single player and both steam and activision will not find or help as to why it won't play in single version so if that is your idea DON'T get it .
2417	0	a	my game wont load and ive tried many things to fix it but its just not working 
2418	0	a	too many hackers and noob tubes in this game and all the legit players can do nothing about it because valve is too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid to fix the game to ban hackers

2421	0	a	not so real game :3
2422	0	a	Game randomly decided not to start after a new steam patch, dont waste your money, go buy the disc at gamestop or from somewhere that will escape you from steam's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ service
2423	0	a	if anyone asked me for couple of years ago, Ill be recommend it to others, now I dont, too many cheaters in this game, and for sure its really sad, cuz its actually a pretty good game, too bad with the cheating stuff..!
2424	0	a	A game for 13 year olds. Boring and linear maps, incredibly imbalanced weapons, and a bad community. Oh, and no dedicated servers, just to screw you over that little bit more. Single player campaign is way too short, multiplayer takes years to get going (and is bad, anyway). Should be in the bargain bin, but they're still charging something ridiculous.
2425	0	a	Spawned in got killed 20 times by a aimboting hacker.       Uninstall had no hackers tho, so 10/10 would uninstall again.
2426	0	a	HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS. But seriously the sensitivity is absolutely terrible for this game as it tries to accelerate all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time.

2435	0	a	It was great with local servers in Australia then the cheap cod owners moved all the mandatory match making servers in asia. If you like constant lag then waste your money on this now â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
2436	0	a	You would think that at least one person would have asked a real soldier just how effective a 7.62mm round is against a soldier. This game is stupid. It takes four or five shots to eliminate a target. Can one of these programmers please demonstrate their bullet-proof cotton by standing in front of firing range and taking 5 rounds from a 5.56mm weapon. This is not a game; it'a a movie. It's scripted, it pre-destined, there is nothing the player can do to change the result. Just shoot stuff and wait for the cut-scenes.  By the way, real soldiers never say the word 'repeat' on the radio - the word repeat in an artillery fire order.  The game takes away your choice to move, to see, and to decide.  The game looks good, but it uses the amazing graphics to draw dirt, snow, and blood on your face. A wasted opportunity. It's a movie. The player has no control over the results. The end scene is excrutatingly frustrating as a boring end-of-game movie. Get the cheat codes and play the one-player levels. Disapointing.
2437	0	a	I remember playing this game a long time ago when it was the best COD you could play. Everything was just amazing. There were no noobtubers, hackers, little kids and more. I used to play an old alternate online version called â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥net and i remeber i it was the best thing i ever played. Nostalgia got me and I decided to buy a Steam version and I can tell you that I'm really dissapointed. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥net players were very fair and honest and there were no hackers and noobtubers. So i remember joining a server and got noobtubed in the first 5 seconds and I thought it was a joke but later on I realised i was wrong. Maybe 40% of poeple who play this game are fair and normal. Before you start â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on me and saying this is an old game I get that but I can tell you that this game is ruined. Long story short this is a game whose community has gone to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2438	0	a	The singleplayer is great, but if you want to buy this for the multiplayer like I did, don't bother. It's filled with cheaters and last I heard a VAC won't stop the cheaters from continuing playing.
2439	0	a	Just played MW2 on 360 again, I hate this now, versus the consoles it's laggy, vacant and has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ controls and the graphics look like clay.
2440	0	a	Private matches dont work
2441	0	a	Multiplayers is full of cheaters.
2442	0	a	Can't say this game is all that great anymore. The single campaign is just not gripping and lasts 5 or 6 hours at best. There are still some people playing multiplayer, but you're SOL if you want to play anything other than Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Search and Destroy. Really only pick this up if you have nostalgia from playing it on an old console.
2443	0	a	It was great with local servers in Australia then the cheap cod owners moved all the mandatory match making servers in asia. If you like constant lag then waste your money on this now â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
2444	0	a	there's a lot of hacker â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in multiplayer
2445	0	a	I got banned for nothing dont buy this game ...
2446	0	a	Joined 3 matches literally 8 people using aimbot and 5 people noob tubing FUN
2447	0	a	5/10 lame propaganda. gameplay itself -get shot just get to cover and you will be good while everyone else is an idiot -runs out and dies from a few shots.
2448	0	a	This franchise shoud be call of Hacks!!
2449	0	a	This Part of the Call of Duty Frabchise was pretty much fun back in the days of its release, nowdays you will most likely only find hacked lobbies &amp; hackers playing online. Still it was much fun to play the first year after release.  Nowdays I would not recommend buying it, only for story mode.
2450	0	a	Whos up for talking about the campaign? NO ONE! There was a few nice mission but half way through it started to fell dull. The ending was super bad. Mute everyone in the lobby and hide the chat and youre all good. Try not to play scrapyard, its filled with people who enjoys the tubes. Its aged well.
2451	0	a	'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better.
2452	0	a	would recommend this game but, untalented/unskillful people, use noobtubes and rpgs. some people play normally, but people use rpgs and noobtubes to carry them to max prestige. ffs
2453	0	a	Was a PC darling before 2 but 4 then turned it into the most popular video game in the world.
2454	0	a	**** TL;DR ALOT OF HACKERS INFINITY WARD/VALVE DONT CARE ANYMORE**** **** ALMOST EVERYTHING IS 'OP' IN THIS GAME THATS HOW IT WAS BALANCED****  Probably my favorite call of duty and ive been playing since launch, but there are ALOT of hackers these days and there are also people that spam grenade launchers all day, and there are people that will DDOS or kick you if they dont like you or you make them mad. It feels like every 3/10 games has a hacker on a GOOD day and it seems to get worse whenever there is a holiday (the kids are off school).Ive had entire nights of trying to play this game and every lobby has a blatent aim botter/wall hacks so i just have to play something else.Why do people hack in a old game like this?  The only time to buy this game in my opinion is when it is at 50% off MINIMUM but i have never seen it go lower than that  so you need to ask yourself: can i deal with hackers,grenade launchers,and possibly modded lobbys all day?  if yes get the game while its on sale and try to enjoy whats left of the game  if no then just skip it and just enjoy the memories of what the game used to be like and go watch a twich stream Kappa  I can not recommend the game in the state that it is in now
2455	0	a	Cons. 1. No mics in lobby [i dont get that] 2. auto aimers and modders in search and destroy 3. very small community 4. i've never played campaign on xbox online multiplayer a ton 5. nothing like xbox 6. save your money. had to log 5mins in campaign menu to leave review exposing how horrible yet another COD multiplayer game is trash thanks to modders.  Just played 4 hours of online. Going to uninstall. Bought on sale for $9 and looked to see if anyone was online in the community hub before i bought it. Search and destory is full of modders and auto aimers that you can't report. They talk alot of trash about killing you 0/50 and say 'git gud'  Well i'm asking for a refund, reviewing this game and saying that this along with all of call of dutys old games is full of auto aimers that destroy and completely crap on the emersion.  DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU WANT AUTO AIMERS TO CAMP YOU IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY THEN SAY 'GIT GUD'  also use ^1-9 to color your text and display name.
2456	0	a	better than the new cods but full of hackers as activion gave up on it after releasing the new crap.
2457	0	a	Instructions for Postal 3: 1. Launch the game. 2. Select New Game. 3. Endure the pain. 4. Open the Pause Menu. 5. Select Quit Game. 6. Uninstall Postal 3. 7. Install Postal 2. 8. Launch Postal 2. 9. Enjoy!  Rating: 3.0
2458	0	a	This game is a mess... and let me count the ways.  1. A broken melee system: Postal, true to the franchise, offers many different tools of the trade to dispose of your enemies. And some of the tools include a sledgehammer, machete, fire axe, and something else I can't remember. But none of that matters because the only one that works is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing machete. It is extremely difficult to land your blow on enemies with other weapons, including your kick, but it doesn't matter because the fire axe and sledgehammer don't even do any damage.  2. Abysmal Gunplay: Would you be surprised if I told you this is the strongest gameplay element? Cuz it is. Is it because it's fun? No. Is it because there's cool weapons? No. It's because guns are pretty much the only gameplay element that functions. A headshot kills any enemy instantly. So, if you don't want to deal with the awfulness of every other tool of the trade, guns are the way to go. And don't bother with the shotgun or the MG. They're both garbage.  3. Awful Humor: Postal 2 got it's humor from satirizing both social issues and video game tropes and controversies. Postal 3 doesn't do this at all. Instead, it goes for stupid humor and shock value. Like terrorists dressing up in giant novelty moustaches and sombreros and sneaking across the US Border. Or firing man juice soaked tissue clumps at Sarah Palin in a porn shop full of men jerking it to monitors. And I'll admit, I laughed a few times, but it wasn't because I thought it was clever. Quite the opposite, in fact. I laughed because it was so utterly stupid and random that it just brought out the inner caveman. And that's the problem; Postal 3 is offensive for all the wrong reasons. There are a few times when the developers want to get tongue and cheeky with you. But it's hard to find it funny when the game keeps kicking your â™¥â™¥â™¥ every chance it gets. Sorry Postal 3, but you can't kick me in the nads and then give me a piece of cake. It doesn't work that way.  4. What-The-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Scale Performance: Do you have a decent gaming rig? Do you have an ultra powerful rig? Well neither matter because Postal 3 is terribly built and optimized. I can run mostly anything on max settings, and yet this game chugs when things get going. And even setting it to low didn't change the performance one bit. It's amazing how you can mess up so bad on an engine designed specifically for non-high end machines.  5. It's Linear &amp; Catharsis Sucks: The entire game has you follow a very narrow path of the dude going about his day just trying to earn some money. And, as you continue, you get to make moral choices that alter which missions you do. This would be fine, if it wasn't Postal. Or, you know, at least done properly. I wanna be free to explore the city and do what I want and attack the story at my own pace. When you beat the game, you unlock the entire city to go around and play in. But when you start it you see just how bad the direction really is. They basically took what they made of the city, and then stitched together the other set pieces from missions into the mix. There's no sense of where you're going at all. It's apparent they did not design a city and split it accordingly. They just made random crap, stitched it together with duct tape, and said, 'Here this is Catharsis.' You know it's bad when you walk up to a highway offramp and end up at the gay rodeo. Oh, yeah, there's a gay rodeo too. If you were expecting more there isn't. That's pretty much the joke. Gay cowboys. Harr harr.  6. Gimmicky Weapons and Assets: Postal 3 showed off a teaser many years ago featuring the Postal dude driving around the city in a segway. They showed this more in the grindhouse trailer they showed at one of the E3 conventions. Guess what? That segway they hyped so much? It's only used in one mission. Yup. One â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing mission. Besides the stupid segway, there's other weapons apart from your normal guns and melee weapons you can use to have 'fun.' There's grenades, the gasoline tank, feral cats with super AIDS (???), etc. And all of these suffer from abysmal controls. Thrown weapons like grenades and cats involve holding down one of the mouse buttons, and then pressing the other mouse button while still holding on to the primary fire button. Or something like that. I don't know and I don't care enough to find out. It's that bad that even after 10 hours of this crap I still couldn't get the hang of throwing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Oh, and the gas tank? Useless. Why? Because it's hard as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to pour the gas out over where you want it specifically and it's even harder to throw your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing match on the gasoline you poured out.  7. Loading Screens: This game has some of the worst loading screens I've ever seen. Not only are they insanely frequent, but they take forever too. There's a loading screen to start the intro videos. Then there's another loading screen after that to load the menu. The first launch of a map or first time loading takes 1 minute and 40 seconds (Yes, I timed it) to load. After that, any other loading screens take between 35-40 seconds.  8. The Moral System: I don't mind if a game has a moral system. What I do mind, however, is when you introduce me to the moral system mechanic, teach me what it does and whatever, and then tell me at the end of the game that it doesn't matter. They try to make it a joke towards endgame with Krotchy (who gave you the tutorial in the first place) telling you it doesn't mean anything. And then at the last level they tell you it actually didn't mean anything. So if you thought you were going to get a different ending mission, or ending cutscene, based on your actions then guess what; you don't. This isn't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing funny, Akella. That is a huge slap in the face to your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing player base. Especially when the moral system was one of the features you boasted about in your trailers and even on this very store page.  In short: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Akella for making it. And â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ RWS for not making themselves and leaving it in the hands of incompetent jagoffs.
2459	0	a	Get Postal 2 instead.
2460	0	a	Postal and Postal 2 taught me to regret nothing, and I took that to heart.   Then I tried playing Postal 3, and now I know nothing but regret.
2461	0	a	Okay, after finally playing the first and second Postal games, I finally decided to give the third installment another shot. Even after learning the backstory of the game (RWS Inc. hired an underfunded and tyrannical game developer company from Russia to code the game), I decided to give it a second chance. Sure, I wouldn't get all the extra little achievements like I did with the first two Postals, but I'd at least beat the game and give it a fair judgment from that, right?  Wrong. I had completely forgotten what it was that had kept me from playing this game in the first place. It wasn't the linear levels (Postal 1 had linear levels). It wasn't the stupid jokes or the weird weapons and minigames (Postal 2 had stupid jokes and weird weapons and minigames). It was the gameplay. Yes, Akeela Software (or whatever they call themselves) had suffered through a Russian economic crash and in suffering fired their competent, cooperative developers and assigned this project to a group of Prima Donnas who not only couldn't correctly string a game together even if it was coming out of their own â™¥â™¥â™¥, but also deliberately altered the structure of the game against the wishes of RWS Inc. (you know, the people who wrote the game series and own the rights to them and CONTRACTED Akeela TO DO MAKE THE GAME THAT RWS had envisioned!!!). Not only that, but Akeela also refused to release the code to the general public because they didn't want those loyal gamers to make MODs or anything, even though RWS Inc. wanted them to. As a result, the gameplay is sticky, jagged, the graphics go photo-negative after 15 minutes of gameplay and glitches flood this game. For example, I had to restart a level because the game wouldn't let me open a door that was integral to the plot, and the escort mission with the segways was almost impossible. All in all, it kept me from enjoying this game not once but twice, which is a shame, because otherwise, I thought it could have been an enjoyable game.   *SPOILER ALERT* For those still interested in knowing, the game pickups where the second one left off: after detonating Paradise, Arizona with a nuke, the Postal dude drove to the next closest fictional town in Arizona, Catharsis. There, a wealthy Ron Jeremy owns and runs everything with a pretty open mind. The problem is that he's constantly being undermined or even flat out attacked by Eco-terrorists, Al Queda, God-fearing hockey moms (led by Sarah Palin...wait...why is she in Arizona?!) and other satirical and colorful characters. The Postal Dude, just trying to make a buck, is given constant choices as to whose side he is on, or at least which side he wants to flip flop to and from. While the levels are linear, your actions do choose the course of the game. Unlike the last game, the third Postal gives you a Max Payne type of third person layout and aiming system, and you get most of the weapons from the previous game, plus a few new ones like beehives, a shopvac (filled with questionably stained tissues) and the badgersaw.   Like I said, it could have an enjoyable installment to the series, but the Russian contractors completely ruined it to the point that RWS Inc. even tells people to stay away from it.
2462	0	a	Postal III is a perfect example of what happenes when you let drug-addled russian mod designers handle your beloved franchise. Avoid like the plague.
2463	0	a	I spent actual money on this, because I am not a very bright man.       It's actually really quite awful, and that's saying something. Forced third person, glitchier than hell, none of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ charm of Postal 2.
2464	0	a	I got this game for free from RWS, but i think they only did that because they wanted to violate me somehow.
2465	0	a	How to play Postal 3  step 1. Never buy it step 2. Never play it step 3. Never â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING play it EVER  My god. MY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GOODNESS GRACIOUS, what a waste of money, even on sale. not even worth $1.99. This game is absolutely horrendous! The sounds are rancid, the controls are broken, the glitches are nasty, the camera has tourette's, the story is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid, the new postal dude style is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ginger, the new voice is something to frown upon, the music is garbage and random, the cast is meh, the menus are bland as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the weapon choice is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the frame rate is worse than the Xbox one; need i say more? Not only is this a failure of a Postal game, but this is one of the worst games i have honestly ever played in my entire life. I never in my entire life uninstalled a game 1 hour in. There is not single positive thing about this game at all. It does not deserve the title of Postal and now i can see why Urinating on the Postal 3 case in Postal 2 gets you an achievement. Even Running With Scissors acknowledges that it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, and that's why they continue to update Postal 2 and pretend Postal 3 is just some spin off.  Do not buy this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unless you either A. Want to play a game that is the equivalent to Foodfight! on Heroin. B. Want to play a game to torture yourself from start to finish. C. Want to buy it for someone else to make them contemplate suicide.  (that's actually how i got this game)  So please, don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing waste your time with this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed from another piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2466	0	a	Basically just avoid this page entirely and go buy Postal 2 instead. It's for your own good.
2467	0	a	Postal 2 won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. It probably won't even make the average top 500 list. That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.  The Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.  This entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.  While I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break.   To give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open.   Unlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.  Postal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game.   Aside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.  Some of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think 'It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?' Well, it's just my opinion, but I liked the second game. It was crass, offensive, and sometimes the humor fell absolutely flat. Yet underneath all of the nastiness, there is still a game. Postal III is broken, and is more prone to cause headaches than provide any entertainment value. The multitude of bugs, scripting failures, and generally unfun game-design, make for a forgettable entry in this controversial series.  *While I did cheat to complete a couple stages, I didn't actually try to skip any.  **The soundtrack is pretty decent.

2468	0	a	I got this game for free, and I still suffer buyer's remorse.
2469	0	a	It's a great torture device! The american agent told me everything after I forced him to play this.
2470	0	a	This is the Adam Sandler of Postal titles. You know how Adam Sandler has talent and doesn't use it? This game kind of works like that.  It had potential to be great, but it didn't bother. Blame the guys in Russia who had done most of the work and decided that it was okay to publish the Bubsy 3D of 2011.
2471	0	a	Terribad.  Nothing like Postal 2, the controls are clunky as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and there are SO MANY LOADING SCREENS. Seriously, there is one stage where its just you in a room waiting to push a button, be prepared for many many one off scenes like this. There is no real explorable world to mess with, its just isolated scenes you do a single mission per scene.  The combat, holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing christ the combat, how do you mess something like that up ? Theres a scene where you fight these crazy soccer moms, but 'making them leave' is almost impossible as they seem to take 10 fully charged stun gun shots and NOTHING HAPPENS. The vagueness in the combat system and missions are laughable at best and after so long get annoying as hell. This is also the first game I have encountered where the crosshairs are completely useless, so that is another gem of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up to add to the ongoing list of fail this game has.  Just buy postal 2 and forget this game came out until RWS decides to make their own kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ addition to the series instead of this outsourced joke of a 'game'.  *UPDATE* Another thing to note: I beat this game in 10 hours, and it only took 10 hours cause i am an achievement â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who will waste lots of free time on any achieve if its there. So this is maybe an 8 hour game at most.
2472	0	a	Itâ€™s not fair to say that the darkness consumed me, for it was I who enveloped myself in it, there was no coercion involved, only my own maddened curiosity. Another Postal game was released? Well, the second one was charming in that somewhat difficult to explain way that not very good games sometimes are, and it was on sale for a tenner, what could I possibly lose? Sometimes in the quiet hours of the night, when it seems not even God is there to hear me, I ask myself what I could have saved had I never clicked â€˜Add to Cartâ€™. Itâ€™s more than the ten dollars, what I lost that day transcends the mere balancing of a checkbook, when I played this game the concepts of love, of faith in my fellow man, the very knowledge of any pleasures I had once known all fled from me in an instant.   I wish I could chalk my dislike of this game up to the awful controls, the movement clunkier than a 50â€™s movie robot or the aiming that I can only describe as â€˜acridâ€™, like the breath of a drunken pirate manning the cannons of his schooner, the fearsome â€˜Nobody Will Ever Love Youâ€™. I canâ€™t though, much like an iceberg made of solid human feces it goes much deeper than the surface problems. I didnâ€™t even come across anything that offensive in my two-hour waterboarding session with Postal 3, I know thatâ€™s exactly what itâ€™s meant to do, and it succeeds with a lot of people, but it just fell flat. The limp and lifeless writing, which is exactly what it permanently rendered certain parts of my body, is the most grotesque thing here aside from the animations and cutscenes. All of this combines to form some sort of chimera of awful design that leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth that has nothing to do with the attempted gross out humor involving vacuum cleaners and AIDS infected cats.   In the end, it all just tries so hard to elicit some kind of response, positive or negative, from the player, but much like God on the day this game was released, it simply left me feeling apathetic.
2473	0	a	This game is about as good as you could expect for a game that was coded in a weekend
2474	0	a	There are no words to describe how awful this one is. So I just want you to imagine a depressed 47 year old man with a massive drinking problem hanging himself by the sunroof inside of his trailer, only to have it break causing him to fall and then start crying until he dehydrates his whole body to death over a course of three days.
2475	0	a	I wouldn't even poke this game with a stick.
2476	0	a	Installed it to uninstall it.
2477	0	a	Postal 3, a third sequel to the cult classic, POSTAL franchise. This game, developed by Akella, NOT Running With Scissors - sees the Postal Dude rigth after a Nuclear Bomb goes off in the previous city, crosses a zombie infested bridge and is now forced to find a job in a new city, Catharsis, where a matter of chaotic events occur.  The game features a branching Storyline System ala Mass Effect's Paragon system, but more black and white with it's execution, it does make the game differ greatly with it's content and is a highly welcome addition imo - the rest of the game however... is terrible. It is a third person shooter that barely plays at all, it was built on Valve's Source Engine way back in the day, this game pretty much controls terribly and loosely, has music falling out of loops, AI bugging out occasionally and much more that just scream unfinished.  I should mention I do enjoy this game for what it is (a fan of the POSTAL franchise and the kind of macabre humor it uses) but from extremely buggy set pieces (Doors closing on you halting chapter progress.), horrible performance issues (Game is NOT enabled to properly run on Multi Core PCs and PhysX feature do a LOT more harm than good), spotty AI and just overall terrible loose mechanics, the game is most definately a skip to those whom are not willing to put up with the game;s shortcoming - those being dang near everything else - considering the game is buggy to the point of it being borderline unplayable.
2478	0	a	Postal 2 was great, but Postal III is just awful.
2479	0	a	This game is so bad the devs needed to make DLC for the old game to make up for this catastrophe.
2480	0	a	Sack of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's one of those games where you constantly have to babysit NPC's who are so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ they can't even follow you to the objective (meaning you can't win.)  Waste of money, and I paid $5 for it.
2481	0	a	Broken, broken, broken. I'll admit that I had fun for a little while, I laughed a couple times, but in the end, the bugs get in the way of this one. Load times are irritatingly long, animations are broken, and it's just not something you'd expect after the better half of a decade of waiting.  If you catch it under $4.99, go for it; it's worth five dollars of fun. Otherwise, keep looking.
2482	0	a	If it weren't for the fact that this game is an unstable piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that crashes if you so much as look at it funny, I might have recommended it anyways in spite of its design problems. The game itself is just the right kind of awful to mock and poke fun at, it's just a shame that getting it to work requires no less than sorcery and blood sacrifices.  Not even for free would I recommend this.
2483	0	a	If you're expecting anything in this game that is either on par with or improved upon from Postal 2, you will be severely disappointed. If you're expecting a competent shooter with good humor, you will be severely disappointed. If you're expecting anything more than complete garbage, you will be severely disappointed.  Seriously, this game just about broke my heart when I played it. At first, I couldn't accept the fact that what I was playing was terrible, because I pre-ordered it for the full $60 and I didn't WANT to believe that it was bad. Regardless, my senses eventually kicked in. This game is the reason why I have a category in my Steam Library labeled 'Horrible Mistakes'.
2484	0	a	  This is BAD.  I now understand why RWS were giving out copies of this at Phoenix Comiccon 2016, so they could have basically no stock of it.  If you really want a sequel to POSTAL 2, get Paradise Lost.
2485	0	a	Play Postal 2 instead of this garbage
2486	0	a	You're better off just buying Postal 2
2487	0	a	If you liked Postal 2 don't buy this game, it's terrible and nothing like Postal 2.
2488	0	a	Running With Scissors - the creators - were royally screwed by the Russian developers. THe Russian developers blew through their money and then pushed the game out to sell it without RWS permission. RWS has disowned this sequel.  That said, this game is a raging pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and not worth your time even if it is free.
2489	0	a	Horrible, horrible game. I like Postal 1 and really enjoy Postal 2. The open endedness is what I especially enjoy and it's totally missing in Postal 3. I played for a short while, to the part where I'm supposed to pick up 'used' tissues. It was at this point I realized the entire game was going to be like this; they stick you in an area with a specific goal and can't do anything else. It's more like a bunch of mini-games. Totally dissappointed and regret spending money for this game.
2490	0	a	Just when I tought nothing could possibly be worse than the movie (Uwe Boll? Seriously? As if he didnÂ´t slaughter enough franchises already...), along came part three.  Plain and simple: This is a very, very, very bad game. Oh boy, is it bad...  If you wonder how bad, just bear in mind that even the original devs (P3 was made by... I donÂ´t know, some studio I never heard of) mocked and retconned it in the latest Postal 2 addon. ThatÂ´s how bad it is.  Go play Postal 2 instead.
2491	0	a	the postal game that RWS technicaly dousen't own  I'm a RWS fan, and I respect Vince Desi, so it pains me to say - don't buy this game. if you have to find out what its like, find someone who has it and play their copy for 15 minuets. find a lets-play, do something, just don't buy this game. this is a train wreck and everyone knows it.   Unless something changed in the past two years RWS is not even making money off this because of the shady coding house they did business with to produce this. that company gutted the script, gutted the features and hurried the alpha out the door as a final game and screwed Running With Sissors out of the rights to the code.   this is an official game but one that RWS can't support and likely a game that they are not making a dime off of. wait for the next chapter of the game because I'm sure the postal dude will dismiss this one as the nightmare it is. Like mario's dream that was Super Mario Bros 2, Postal III might as well not exist in the catalog of this franchise.  I do no exagerate in saying that this game is completely broken, unbalenced and not fun. a total waste of $20  buyer be ware- This is a steaming pile!
2492	0	a	It has SO much missing potential, but unfortunately, it's a bit of a letdown. Doesn't stop me from modding it, though. It's pretty flexible in that department.
2493	0	a	This is the edgy annoying teenager of video games. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Even RWS (Running With Scissors, the developers of the previous two Postal games) have dissed this game. You know it's bad when developers diss an installment of their own franchise. It's not even entertaining in the really bad game sense, it's just pure try-hard garbage. Put your money towards Postal 2, or hell, any other game, but do not even get close to this game.
2494	0	a	After so many years, Postal 3 is released... BUT... by the aptly named Trashmasters. The game, while it has an awesome themesong you can hear in the trailer, has agonizing load times, insufferable missions, awkward controls, and forcing you to sit through all this for the sandbox option, make this worse than a disappointment.  Running With Scissors has completely disowned with 'installment' and with good reason. Stay far away from this. This is not a 'game,' it's a shattered dream.  Edit: Oh, also, RWS didn't even make the thing. It was made by the aply named Trashmasters.
2495	0	a	Poorly optimised, and doesn't live up to the glory of Postal 2.
2496	0	a	I love the postal series don't get me wrong but I just think they did a horrible job on this one it just felt slow and the game got you scratching your head. I recommend you buy postal 1 and 2 not this one sorry.
2497	0	a	I'm a huge fan of the Postal series. I have been for a long time. The last game I came across in the series was Postal 3... not even developed by RWS. Confused, but enticed by the 'Postal' title, I purchased it. What I was met with was unspeakable... Broken movement, awful animations, atrocious voice acting, a lackluster story and gunplay so broken and not fun I just... ugh.. I forced myself to beat this game. Resulted in headaches (I'm serious) rage, (I'm serious) and almost coming to TEARS (I'M SERIOUS) DO. NO. BUY. IF YOU HAVE, GET A REFUND!  Edit: I did it on the good path, which is even worse than the bad path, BECAUSE IN SOME PARTS YOU CAN'T KILL ANYONE IN A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING POSTAL GAME. A GAME ABOUT KILLING, WHY WOULD THERE BE A GOOD PATH?!
2498	0	a	This game is not good
2499	0	a	Get Postal 2, stay away from this game. The devs act like this game didnt exist, thats why they made paridise lost to make up for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.
2500	0	a	As a huge fan of committing attrocities in Postal 2, I'm sorry to say I had to give up on this weak â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Gone is the open world, free form fun. No, now we need to follow some half-baked linear story as if that was ever anyone's interest in this franchise. How is grabbing cats and decking soccer mums anything compared to filling a bank with grenades, pouring in gasoline and making it rain like a stripclub of flaming meat-paste. This is the diet coke of evil.
2501	0	a	No... just no. Poor performance, third person postal, no cool weapons and missions
2502	0	a	0/10  One of the clunkiest, ugliest, and most senseless sacks of garbage that I have ever come across. I am absolutely ashamed and embarrassed to own this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! I would pay money for Steam to remove this off my history forever so that I never have to be reminded of its existence. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Postal III!
2503	0	a	Akella won't even fix this game. Do yourself a favor and go buy Postal 2 rather than this turd
2504	0	a	Honestly, do the world a favor and buy postal 2, not this. However, if you like the idea of modding, postal 3 is quite easy to alter, that's literally the only upside. As quite frankly the missions are awkward as sin, awkward aiming with weaponry and incredibly clunky melee combat. But then again the clunky melee combat is a GIVEN, it's source engine afterall folks.  Honesty time: Only purchased this to mod it to recreate / attempt to remake postal 1 or 2 features in it.
2505	0	a	As a Postal fan, I was surprised to see this wasn't actually good. I got to the second mission, where you have to use cat nip spray to get a bunch of HIV cats, however, there was a few problems.  1: When a cat gets latched onto you, you have to spam left and right mouse to get it off. This wouldn't be a problem, but if you have the cat nip out, you can easily press right mouse, which consumes a ton of cat nip that's needed for the mission. Yes, it's limited. No, there are no refills (not as far as I could see)  2: The Chinese gang never stopped attacking me. And this is the second level, where my only weapons are cats, cat nip spray, and a vacuum. They had pistols, machetes, and M16s. Little unfair. Also, they never stopped respawning, leaving little time for me to grab the cats. I ended up having to throw a cat at one of the guys to grab a machete, which took some time. Which brings me to point 3.  3: Some weapons are broken. My favorite weapon from Postal 2, the machete, is reduced to a useless toy. The main attack took many attacks, and throwing it like a boomerang was hard. The machete wasn't thrown at the crosshair, rather below it, and even then it would miss a ton of targets. Also, it got stuck often, even when thrown in an open space.  After dying 3 times, the game crashed. I was dissapointed in this game. The gore is better than Postal 2 in my opinion, but there's so many glitches and the game is unfair on the earliest levels. Although, I'm probably one of the few who's okay with the new voice actor (mainly because Akella actually offered to have Rick Hunter voice the game, though he refused) and while some lines were pretty funny to me ('I blame pacman.') some lines pretty much made me cringe. ('Bacon bacon bacon!' and other fire related lines) I also think I heard him say a really old meme (the cheeseburger one) but since this game was made in 2011 I can excuse that.  If you do plan on getting this game, turn off motion blur at the start. It'll save you a lot of headaches.  
2506	0	a	I loved Postal 2 and heck I even enjoyed the Uwe Boll film. But this game kind of sucks to be honest. It has some enjoyable moments here and there but most of the time it just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off. The AI can be very annoying most of the time. For example. the mission where you have to escort the slave to City Hall. Every time I shot a paparazzi he would run back and I would have to hit him just so he can follow me. There are also a crap ton of glitches. In the same mission the slave would always get stuck trying to pass through a doorway. I would have to shoot him and keep saving so I can restart. The voice acting was sub par at best. It feels like no one really wanted to be there. I might continue playing the game but that's only because I payed for this and because I loved the second one. I wouldn't be surprised if I just stopped playing because I have better games.
2507	0	a	Well, I was really looking forward to this when I saw it, hoping it was as silly as the first two games, but amazingly enough, it's got less story than Postal 2, and the camera shaking, oh lord, that was hard to cope with while playing it, and then it was made with the Source engine, which you can see pretty much straight away, I would stay away from this game unless you have a gut of steel and don't want to play it for the story. No freeroaming up to where I've gotten, which is very sad.
2508	0	a	Don't know what to say about POSTAL 3.The story is ok...A pretty good soundtrack but the gameplay sux and is very repetitive: Pros: -Good story -Has some funny moments -You get to play as a cop XDDD Cons: -Full of bugs -Few weapons -Melee weapons are horrible in this game -Very repetitive -Some achievements won't unlock -Poor AI; I would only recommend this game if you are a hardcore fan of the postal series.On the other hand this game wasn't taken seriously by the game devs. they just thrown some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ togheter and called it Postal 3.But in the end it's not that bad if you manage to spent some time in it,don't forget it was made with Source Engine and has his good parts.In my opinion I'll give a 5.5/10.
2509	0	a	I have been a fan of Running with Scissors and Postal, but Postal III was not published by Running with Scissors and had me bored after 75 minutes. It is time to go back and play the original Postal. Hopefully some day Running with Scissors will make a new Postal similar to the original with updated graphics.
2510	0	a	no where near as good as the second one. plus it has bugs... just fotget this one and go get the second one, its so much more fun.
2511	0	a	wow this is horriblly unplayable. I can totally understand the sub-par reviews; silly me I thought it would have been for the subject matter. Horrible controls, lousy graphics, bad gameplay and voice acting combinded with sub-standard in-you-face forced info cutscenes that add nothing. 13 gig download for THIS? Avoid at all costs unless you like to feel ripped off.
2512	0	a	I got this game for free, but I cant shake the feeling that I got ripped off somehow...
2513	0	a	Reading through Postal 3's design documents was more fun than actually playing it.  Update: Updating this review just so I can get a Steam badge ._.
2514	0	a	'Rated W for what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ were they thinking?'  The trailer said it best. This game is so horrible that even RWS hates it. Paradise lost-DLC for Postal 2 is the true sequel to Postal 2, not this piece of trash.
2515	0	a	I'm bored and I felt like writing some negative reveiws, so i've decided to re-write my Postal III review!  Pros: -RWS retconned the events of this game so really this game is not even part of the actual story line, it was only a terrible nightmare in the mind of The Postal Dude during his radiation coma in Paradise Lost! -It's a great joke   Cons: -It's all toilet humor -Has pointless celebrity cameos -Doesn't feel like a Postal game -It features Uwe Boll -The developers (Akkella) didn't optimize the game at all -It runs on a very broken version of the source engine (Akkella literally broke Source) -Akkella refused to release the source code -Akkella refused to update the game -Akkella refused to release an SDK KIT -RWS had to create a DRM hack to make the game actually launch on newer OS's -It's not worth 20 dollars   FINAL RATING: 0/10 (DO NOT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BUY THIS)   Here's a link to POSTAL 1 and 2 AND the newest Expansion Pack for Postal 2, go buy these instead.  POSTAL:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/232770/   POSTAL 2:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/223470/   POSTAL 2 (PARADISE LOST):  http://store.steampowered.com/app/360960/ 
2516	0	a	Listen to everything you hear about this game. It's awful. I think the biggest problem is they tried to make the game far more linear than past Postals, and yet still fill it with fetch quests. I was just bored. Constantly. The humor is awful, too. Not even in a 'ah that was a bad pun' kind of way, but in a 'kid in the back of the class who thinks he's hilarious by spouting awful jokes and catch-phrases' kind of way. Big disappointment.
2517	0	a	i bought this ONLY for the story and the fact that i love the postal series and want more of it, the game is complete garbage. and the rws is self aware that this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. if you love good games, don't buy this crap. 
2518	0	a	Classical deadly madness meet silly stupid trash. Sometimes it is even ridiculous. 5/10
2519	0	a	All in all, the game just feels... disingenuous. It was difficult enough to recommend this game. I was previously under the impression that had this game not been so poorly optimized (multiple crashes, poor hit detection, abysmal framerate during combat), this game would have been perceived as just... okay. However, I had to give my two cents.  Pros: *The Soundtrack - surprisingly good. Clearly much more effort went into it than everything else.  Aaaand that's about it.  Netural Points: *Third person perspective - I personally don't mind it, but it would've been nice to have had the option of having a first person perspective, too. *Corey Cruise as Postal Dude - disappointing to not have Rick Hunter's amazing voice soothing my ears, but Cruise still does a commendable job.  Cons:  Hoo boy. Here we go.  *The Humor - The game made me laugh out loud a few times, but it needed more originality. Rehashing lines and jokes from Postal 2 doesn't make it funny. It feels forced. Also, guys, making The Postal Dude say 'I blame (irrelevant subject here)!' nearly every time he kills something isn't. funny. The only one that made me laugh was 'I blame Christian Metal.'  *No map, arrows, or anything that indicated where to go next. *The annoyingly long loading times. *Poor optimization. *crashes frequently. *stutters every time a new mission starts. *A.I. can be incredibly stupid, especially when you're supposed to protect someone. *The sound is imbalanced. The last mission was nothing but LOUD gunfire. Nearly put me in a trance. Did give me a headache, though. *No Open-world exploration in between missions - Seriously??? This is what made Postal 2 so much fun!  *The Story is told in past tense - Kind of hard to explain, but The Postal Dude narrates the entire game and explains what happens next in the story. This is fine, but sometimes it's better to PLAY and not TELL what happens next. Can I please PLAY the scenario out and not have to be bombarded with cutscenes that break the momentum and flow?  *Good/Evil karma system, Multiple Endings - interesting idea. good for replayability. Too bad I achieved one of the endings in about 5 hours, most of which were spent wondering where the heck I was supposed to go next. Besides, there's no way I'd want to replay this again. Too much of a chore.  Did I enjoy myself during this game? A little. Did I laugh? Yes. Are Postal 2, and Postal 2: Paradise Lost superior to this game in every conceivable way? Oh yes. Heck yes.
2520	0	a	The game could have been a below average shooter with an interesting setting if the game worked as it should. But the game does not work as it should. The performance is horrible, hit detection for melee weapon sucks and the game crashes all the time.
2521	0	a	This game is just a crap...   Nothing works the way it should and killing stuff just feels boring, even shooting sperm paper feels boring.  It is not nearly as open as the second game and feels more like a corridor shooter (even if it isn't).   I recommend picking up the second installment in the series instead.    2/10
2522	0	a	Game always crashes at a certain point of the story for me during the initial release, now even today the game hasnt been fixed. Im not gonna bother looking for fixes for an abomination of this game is, i wish steam refund released when i bought this game.
2523	0	a	I am uncertain if it is a joke or not, but I found it to be a terrible game. It tries to play up as many jokes as it can about the history of the Postal franchise and how vulgar it can be, but part of the endearing peice of Postal 2 was that is was an open world. This is more like a hallway where you just get to do something disturbing, instead of causing a city block to devolve into a blood bath. Postal 2 was a great game, let us forget that this was even made.
2524	0	a	One Word... HORRIBLE.  The fact that this game wears the name Postal is a disgrace. Everything you loved about the Postal franchise gets â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by bad Russian developers who took in fact many years to create this broken crap product. It was also released way too early. Thanks to a Russian publisher which went for the money. I hope Akella is dead. RWS got pretty much ignored when this product was created. Also Akella and the devs left the product to die. Not even a proper source code has been released. This makes it nearly impossible to fix or mod the game. There are a few decent mods though. The game is so bad that many game functionalities are simply not working like melee weapon hit detection. To this comes bad performance and crashes. Story and gameplay wisely this product is a joke anyway. But I personally dont waste my time with this product and you shouldnt neither. Buy Paradise Lost instead. Or wait for Postal 3 Unreal. A Postal 3 remake in the unreal engine. Remade from scratch! Also there is Catharsis Reborn. Some sort of remake/sequel/alternative game in the Postal 3 Source engine. They might be able to create something good with it. Also we might be getting a proper patch once, but I doubt it. The game would still be bad for a Postal game, even if its fixed and bugfree.  I waited so long for it, but it was just crap in the end. Sad story...  My Rating? None, I simply dont want to rate a broken alpha product. Not worth it. If you really need to try this game, get it somewhere 'free' or get a very very cheap key. Sometimes RWS also gives some out for free, as demonstration how bad the game is. Im honest, I didnt finish the game. I guess some years ago I made it to the half with tons of crashes. Recently I got the Steam version for a cheap price. Its nearly as bad as it was when it was released. I simply cant bring myself to play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to end. Seriously. This game rapes me, I demand injury compensation!  Positive: - Partly nice art design - I partly like the 'evil' twin Postal Dude's design and new voice, cool that it was reused in Paradise Lost  Negative: - Bugs and crashes - Perfornance problems - Sound mixing problems, too loud, too quiet, missing sounds, unfitting sounds - Melee weapons have a hit detection thats probably the worst ever - Unifitting unpostalish humor - No free roam - Boring repetitive missions - Trash, bad sort of trash - Bad English grammar and text - Russian quality in general... + Akella sucks  It may could have been a good game if they let RWS help with the developement. But instead there was silence between both devs and Akella just made it worse with fast releasing it. This was the death for the game. RWS regrets this game a lot and I doubt that there will ever be something like this happening again.
2525	0	a	So â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing disappointed in this game. Don't get me wrong, I loved the first two Postal games but this one is hands down one of the worst games I've ever played. It's Sonic '06 level bad people. Basically the game throws you into 3-4 minute load screens and that's not even the worst of it. Sure, you can run around and kill whoever and whatever you want, but the missions are all, and I mean every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ one, is a kill this many people or keep this many protesters at bay. There's nothing else to this game.  Still want to play? Enjoy the worst voice acting I have ever seen and somehow, the graphics look worse than Postal II. The gameplay and weapons are all grotesque, and not in a good way. The 'sick humor' is about as sick as my dying veteran, grandpa, bland and just lies there laughing to himself like a four year old that finds the word 'booger' to be the funniest thing ever. Can't believe I wasted my money on this and I wish I could get a refund and afford to see a therapist about this game.
2526	0	a	  people make mistakes. This one is easy to avoid though.
2527	0	a	This is quite possibly the worst game ever made. Not even ironically enjoyable in any capacity.   A blight on humanity.
2528	0	a	WATCH OUT HE'S GOING POSTAL 3 EXCEPT THIS TIME IT'S â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING TRASH â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU
2529	0	a	I am not going to make a review about the story or the sense of the game. Postal 2 was a well made game with a nice way to play.  But Postal 3 is such a bad compiled bunch of time wasting. The controls are horrobly. The loading times are also terrible. All cutscenes (even uif you skip them) are annoying.  I was realy looking for a good time in Postal 3 and haveing some fun listening to all the critical comments and events.  I am sorry to say but Postal 3 sucks. (Just to keep the slang of Postal)
2530	0	a	Don't Buy This.
2531	0	a	I love humor and some ideas in this game (soundtrack is quite good too) but, well, too many things are f*cked up. Stupid AI (espessially in escort missions), a lot of bugs, crashes, outdated graphics, cover system which doesn't help in any way, collision system, tiny city, police which doesn't really give a f*ck (if you kill something about 20 people a few policemen will start to chase you and if you kill them... that's all), good path (really?) which is boring as s**t, aiming... Do I really need to mention more? It's quite pity... Oh, it doesn't even work on Windows 8.1 by the way.  EDIT: Well, I found a way to launch this s**t on Windows 8.1 but still, all other things I mentioned aren't fixed (and most probably won't be).
2532	0	a	everything that made postal 2 fun has been stripped and retextured.. what a shame
2533	0	a	what a major let down, I regret my purchase. Waste of $20.00
2534	0	a	Payed $40 for this on release. I wanna buy it for a m8 as a joke, but the thought of spending a total of $50 altogether leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
2535	0	a	alright let me start off by saying postal 2 is one of the best games that has ever been made on steam BUT and this is a big but this game is as worthless as it is slow it crashes every ten minutes the controls are insanely clunky and broken, the glitches are game breaking for example my sprint button dosn't work at all, the cutscenes take hours and appear every five seconds it is now in third person which completely ruins the atmosphere my finale words on this game is better luck next time running with scissors I think it's time to go back to your roots.
2536	0	a	The Postal Dude awakens with a shock, it was all just a horrible nightmare. or was it?
2537	0	a	13 hours pain 13 hours screaming and beating my keyboard 13 hours of nightmare + I think i got ebola and cancer from this.
2538	0	a	Press shiny red button to crash.
2539	0	a	when i was first buying the game i was sad to see such poor reviews for the game but like the consumer i am i bought the thing on sale.I was so excited but then it happened,line after line of reused jokes from postal 2.Mind you they did have some good original ones but it didnt make up for the unappealing gameplay.So to get a good grip of whats good and bad.Here's some pros and cons. Lets start with some good news Pros  Funny story(And thats pretty much it)  Cons  Buggy gameplay  Rehashed jokes from the originals   No open-world   Third-person change  crappy new cover system   The saddest part is,its not rws's fault here its when they hired other companies to help and they burned all their money away and shoved this pile of filth out. So if you plan on buying it dont because it will sit in your library gaining dust.   
2540	0	a	Don't buy this game is broken.
2541	0	a	Postal 3 is definitely a unique game. It isn't good. It tries too hard to be funny, and fails completely while in the process. I really had no fun playing this game and it doesn't even have giggle value while playing with friends. It isnt worth much imo but was a unique experience and a good topic for any bad video game analysis speech or paper.
2542	0	a	How do you release a crappy game? It's easy Just be the one with the name 'Akella'
2543	0	a	Don't get me wrong, Postal III is hilarious and I have a good time playing but the glitches just make it unbearable. At best I could get an hour of playtime before the game crashes. If it were not for the bugs and glitches then Postal III would have been a hilarious masterpiece. If anything its all these annoying bugs that hold it back from being such a good game.
2544	0	a	(English) Postal 3 A wonderful example of what happens when you trust the game of left-wing uncles and aunts from Akella.I can't understand why RWS did not do the game themselves,and in fact sent her to the slaughter.

2546	0	a	I really wanted to play this game but it is so poorly optimized I can barely play it ;( If there is any patches let me know.
2547	0	a	They tried.
2548	0	a	ok so this game is based on current world issues and stuff and just makes fun of stereotypes and can be offensive and has been really contraversial for ever, like since 1997, and if you arnt a baby its incredibly fun. this is not as good as the first 2 seeing as it was made by a different studieo but its still a good time. not great but ok.its fun if your super bored but Postal 2 is way better.this is like a spin off, even rws says so.  {RWS Explanation}v Postal III didnâ€™t turn out how RWS had hoped. The original plan was for RWS to do game design and style art, with Akella responsible for production (coding, game art, audio, playtesting, etc.). The project started out great with both groups working close together, then the first blow came with the Russian economy taking a hit and Akella lost their A development team and the project got moved to Team B. Looking back now we should have canceled the project then as there was no way the new less qualified team was going to be able to deliver a â€œAâ€ quality game. The next big blow was when Akella started chopping away at our design (to accommodate the limited skills of the 2nd string team), this only got worse over time. From eliminating gameplay to single player only to PC only and scratching consoles. The hole kept getting deeper and the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ shovel was in full force. We didn't even get to see or play the game in the last 12 months of development, then the worst thing happened. Akella was desperate for money trying to prevent going out of business. They made the fatal decision to â€˜wrap it upâ€™ at alpha and call it done, releasing it to the Russian market, then on Steam for the international market.  Akella retains control of all the source code and assets for Postal III which they will not share with us or the modding community, so we are unable to fix Postal III ourselves, leaving a flawed and unfinished game. RWS also do not profit from Postal III sales and we stopped selling it ourselves the moment it was clear we would be unable to support the product.  Postal III is not without some redeeming features for fans of POSTAL: graphically it looks nice, the cutscene art and music was decent and it has some interesting unique weapons such as the Badger Saw. The branching storyline and Good versus Bad system allows you to replay the game and encounter new levels, alternative scenes and it even allows you to complete the objectives differently. The game at least knows itâ€™s a train wreck and will often make fun of itself during the objective screens.
2549	0	a	I played postal 2 many many many times through. The open world gameplay and funny easter eggish type gameplay was a lot of fun. You could follow the story or just run around causing chaos with awesome effects and humorous outcomes.  So I was super excited and suprised when I saw postal 3 on steam. Boy was I majorly disappointed. I saw it had the potentional for that same off society norm humor but the game itself is terrible. NO OPEN WORLD. The first few 'areas' I tried were timed, small and so poorly executed it was frustrating. Not to mention where the crosshairs are and where you can actually hit anything was beyond frustrating. I tried for at least an hour or so to have any fun but finally gave up and uninstalled. So sad too compared to the genius of the first 2 games.
2550	0	a	Terrible game... Game Is base off an old source engine build so all the levels caches need to rebuild apon loading, The AI is terrible and annoying, Weapon selection is terrible sometimes during heavy combat, why put in a shotgun then have no ammo for it for the entire â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game? , The game crashed at least four times when loading a few levels.. It's not worth it.. another classic game gone to nothing but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! &gt;=C
2551	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's long-winded, it's thirdperson, there are next-to-no terrorists and it doesn't have Free-Roam by default.  In short, don't waste your money, buy Postal 2 again.
2552	0	a	POSTAL 3 is just crappy not fun .... i liked the Postal 2 the best
2553	0	a	It sucks.  2/10
2554	0	a	I don't think this would be a recommendation, it's more like an avoidation. If you want a good Postal game, get the old ones. Since this one right here was a big disappointment. In short I recommend that you shouldn't get this.
2555	0	a	I sure enjoyed Postal 2... Now there's a Postal 3 on the Source Engine! The trailers and gameplay look cool, nothing too serious just messing around. Is this game worth buying? No. Not at all. Back when this was first released the publishers of this game released it early by mistake (a month!) later on the game was re-released a few months later. It was a complete disaster. The steam version is in Russian, and there is no legit or 'legal' way should I say to get this game into English. The game is very buggy, very poor performance and frame rate issues, clunky controls, the game is just bad. Don't buy it. Ever.
2556	0	a	This is the buggiest piece of crap I have ever played. Steam REFUSES to give me a refund, even though I bought this game back in April of 2012 for $40. The only reason I have more than 2 hours playtime is because it was stuck in the loader downloading the game on a 384kb line back in 2012 (I live in South Africa) and steam decided that me downloading the game was actually me playing it. I hardly played this game, it completly bugged out on the segway mission, with AI driving into walls and getting stuck. Worst purchase I have ever made, I urge anyone else considering to buy this NOT TO. Don't pay a single cent for this garbage.
2557	0	a	This game is awfully developed, disappointing to play, 'a bad joke'-to pay for and i can advise it to nobody. It's really like a 'Beta-Version' and is not worth 01,00$! Everything is glitching and you'll find a bug every minute. I love(d) 'Postal II' so much, it was one of the best games I've ever played. Postal III is not just nearly unplayable. It has nothing to do with Postal II - game mechanics. No more 'free-world' action-adventure 'I have to buy milk and will not pay for it' - freedom.  Do not buy it. It's on sale? Do not buy it! Someone gifted it to you. Do not play it!
2558	0	a	As a diehard fan of the real Postal games, it's very difficult for me to think of any redeeming qualities of Postal III.  Many know this already, but for those who don't, Postal III is not the creation of Running With Scissors. It was licensed to Akella in hopes of developing a next generation Postal game, but thanks to the Russian recession Akella went bankrupt and all developmental work went to a fledgling 'b-team.' The results were catastrophic, as what was once intended to be an open ended and graphically impressive Postal became a bug-ridden mess.   Although its price can never be justified even at 50% off, I will say that for those who already own it, two things about this game are decent. First is the free-roam feature that is unlocked after completing those horrid story missions. If you really can't stand playing through it, which few can, there are ways to bypass the missions that a simple Google search will yield. The free-roam itself is mediocre, as there are few things to do but walk around and slaughter a few civilians until the game crashes, but it's much more rewarding than the series of tutorials that constitute the main game.  The second feature worth mentioning was a joke that occurred... I'd say about halfway through the game, where the Alternative Postal Dude is approaching a building being held up by rather incompetent shooters. In the midst of the inaccurate bullet fest, a peacekeeper attempts to approach the building only to have his head blown off. The Postal Dude then exclaims, 'holy s***, did they level up?' It made me laugh, anyways.  That's really all that's worth experiencing in Postal III. You're much better off paying a fraction of Postal III's price to own the real Postal games.

Many know this already, but for those who don't, Postal III is not the creation of Running With Scissors. It was licensed to Akella in hopes of developing a next generation Postal game, but thanks to the Russian recession Akella went bankrupt and all developmental work went to a fledgling 'b-team.' The results were catastrophic, as what was once intended to be an open ended and graphically impressive Postal became a bug-ridden mess.   Although its price can never be justified even at 50% off, I will say that for those who already own it, two things about this game are decent. First is the free-roam feature that is unlocked after completing those horrid story missions. If you really can't stand playing through it, which few can, there are ways to bypass the missions that a simple Google search will yield. The free-roam itself is mediocre, as there are few things to do but walk around and slaughter a few civilians until the game crashes, but it's much more rewarding than the series of tutorials that constitute the main game.  The second feature worth mentioning was a joke that occurred... I'd say about halfway through the game, where the Alternative Postal Dude is approaching a building being held up by rather incompetent shooters. In the midst of the inaccurate bullet fest, a peacekeeper attempts to approach the building only to have his head blown off. The Postal Dude then exclaims, 'holy s***, did they level up?' It made me laugh, anyways.  That's really all that's worth experiencing in Postal III. You're much better off paying a fraction of Postal III's price to own the real Postal games.
2560	0	a	whose â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idea was this
2561	0	a	Possibly the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥est game of all time.   aiming is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, very linear and repetative and no option to explore.  if its a choice between this and having your balls bitten off by a rabid mouse then I strongly suggest finding that mouse
2562	0	a	I played this game for half an hour, and that was it.I counldn't take any more terrible gameplay. Dont waste your time, Postal 2 was way better
2563	0	a	Oh God, this game sucks. The combat sucks, the physics suck, the missions suck, the voice acting sucks, the weapons suck, the graphics suck, and so forth.  Also, it runs like crap.  [Rating: 35/100]
2564	0	a	Game crashed 3 times.. says a lot with how long I've played, don't bother buying it!
2565	0	a	Don't buy this game. Never. Take Postal2, it's better.
2566	0	a	Easily one of the worst games ever created.
2567	0	a	I really wanted to love this game I really did. They changed it from the FPS style that Postal had into a third person view which really took away from the appeal that Postal 2 had. The game itself is also very buggy, the devs promised updates to this. The raunchy humor is a bit tuned down in this installment. I gave it 5/10 which is mostly the nostalgia talking. RWS should have just made a updated Postal 2 and they would have made a great game.
2568	0	a	I would advise anyone not to purchase this game. Apparently there is no way to activate. So unfortunately I can't give a review of the game itself. Just a PSA to anyone thinking of purchasing.
2569	0	a	As much as I wanted to love this game I just cant bring myself to. I played postal 2 nonstop when I discovered it years ago and was stoaked when I found out about the third game. I would recommend sticking to postal 2.
2570	0	a	Probably the black sheep of the postal series, this peice of crap dosen't even deserve the title of being a game, it is a peice of crap baddly made horrible and pure filth and stain on the postal series, first off, rick hunters is not the voice actor of postal dude anymore they got some wannabe who sounds like Duke nukem, postal dude is not postal dude without his Briliant old voice actor, second off, the game is in third person, WHAT THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, postal 2 was in first person and it was amazing even if the third persion animations were not amazing the action in first person made up to it, it gave a better expirence in my opinion, third, Not open world, the story sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the charaters are stupid, and the game promotes you todo good things?! WHAT THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥?! you are ment to go bad â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ insain in postal and kill what you want and do what you want, if you are not able to enjoy that without the game saying 'Oh if you do good you will have a good ending' thats just stupid, Postal is about sinister dark humor and you having your way with the game,the voice acting is stupid the weapons suck and it runs on the most overused engine, no not unreal thats an awesome engine, im talking about source yes the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing source engine, the primitive engine that valve uses but they use it great, these stupid ukranian developers made a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game with it so thats pure garbage, there name is trashmasters, pff no wonder they are masters at making trash â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ baddly made games, please running with scissors cut contact with those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ devs expand your team get rick hunters back and give the postal fans what they want, postal 2 made my late childhood amazing and to see the postal series downfall is not somthing i want.   -Dukie A hardcore postal fan
2571	0	a	No, just no, the game is full of bugs and the AI is so silly. Enjoy the first time that you complete the carreer, because after that the game turns so repetitive and isn't fun anymore. All what they had to do was improve the graphics of Postal II, add a few new features, weapons, stuff, and this game would be a gem. Just doesn't worth the $20
2572	0	a	Dont buy this game unless it is Â£2 / $3.50 its just not worth any more than that. I am a fan of the Postal series so i was happy to buy it, i knew it would be bad from reviews but wanted to play the story through for storyline reasons.  Dont buy it unless you have played Postal 2 as it could put you off the series  This on the other hand is a complete knock up of a game, its buggy and its incomplete.  Theres no way the game can be fixed because akella wont release the source code to RWS . Why !?  couldnt they just make more money if the game was better? i dont know the polotics and im not bothered...them &amp; running with scissors issues not mine   So basically a badly broken game, bugs glitches, no crashes for me but others have said they had them.  It does have some humour but not like postal 2 .   But all in all a let down , and a prime example in gaming of 'what could have been'
2573	0	a	Take everything that made Postal 2 good, now get rid of it and replace it with a extremely buggy, unfunny game.   Just play Postal 2 again if you are a Postal fan, I was massively disappointed by this and loved the first 2 games.
2574	0	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ not fun, hard to relate to! not as fun as 2  verry annoying start.
2575	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ compared to Postal 2.
2576	0	a	Wow, this is one big-blast waste of money. Seriously. I played Postal 2, and I was a huge fan of it. But this one? Crappy made, reused sounds from it's predecessor, laggy controling and gameplay, broken game mechanics. I don't even comprehend how the developers could be anything near happy with that game, after what they've accomplished in the past. Keep your money away from â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of game design, guys.
2577	0	a	The branching paths gimmick gives it enough replaybility to go through it at least twice, the shooting is fun and the story is consistently funny. On the other side, it's a mess of bugs and glitches and costs too much for what plays like something made 5 years ago. Buy it when it's u$20 or less.
2578	0	a	Do not buy. Not if you like Postal. Not if it's on sale. Never ever. I though 'Oh well it's Postal so of course it's trashy, but who cares?'. It's crap. I wish I could say a nice thing, but it's that bad.
2579	0	a	Not worth buying.. the second game was kinda hilarious, running around and doing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all over the place, but this game doesn't even come close to it. Gameplay is constantly interrupted by stupid video sequences, the third person perspective is a step back as aiming and shooting with weapons is very inaccurate, there is a lot of bugs and the game crashes every few times. Where is the original corny voice of the postal dude? The new voice is not nearly as good. I can only say: don't bother with this game, unless maybe for a discount price.
2580	0	a	Fun to play, but doesn't work without downloading and installing a patch online. For months I thought I had thrown 20 bucks in the trash.

2582	0	a	If like me, you're one of the sick individuals that loved Postal 2 and for some reason tuned out all the negative press about THIS game as the usual reactionary nonsense... RUN! This is broken, souless and dissappointing. It's not fun, it's not funny, it's not as open or even really as violent. The stupidity is no longer tongue in cheek, it's just stupid, like, the unholy offspring of Sarah Palin and Boris Johnson stupid. Go play Postal 2 instead, it has new DLC... for some reason.
2583	0	a	My biggest mistake. This game haunts my library with its presence Kill me
2584	0	a	This is made by a company called 'Trash Masters.' Their animated logo features the a letter T and M actually engaging in intercourse. If that sounds funny to you, it only goes downhill from there.
2585	0	a	In a word NO! Don't go for it. I loved Postal 2 with its open ended world (with progressive plot if you knew where to look) and wicked sense of humour. I thought I was getting a good deal when I got a $10 steam key from the publisher for Postal 3, but it couldn't even live up to that. Each mission takes place on a small map. The movement is awkward. It isn't even worth saying more.
2586	0	a	One of the most unoptimized PC games ever made. It crashes, it freezes, and it stutters, constantly. Even with user-created .cgf files, Postal III is guaranteed to be a frustrating technical challenge for even the most stacked high-end computer.  The developers went belly up shortly after the game was released, and it's not hard to understand why after playing just a few minutes of this atrocious excuse for code. Even worse, the publisher has disavowed Postal III completely, and they refuse to fix it or improve it in any way, shape, or form.  Not only is Postal III a buggy piece of crap, it fares no better gameplay-wise. Despite being an open-world game, the story forces you down a particular path, and you aren't allowed to free roam until you've completed all the missions. The weapons suck, the graphics suck, the environments suck, the sound effects suck. Absolutely everything about Postal III sucks. You're better off going with Postal 2 -- it's cheaper and it actually runs properly.  Screw the developers and the publisher of this digital abortion. They should have known better.
2587	0	a	Not as great as I was hoping for. This one was licensed out and made by a Russian third party developer and not by RWS in-house. It has it's moments but it's lacking in some areas. It's also very buggy at times.
2588	0	a	Being a big fan of Postal 2, I got this one as soon as it was released, but it was so terribly unfinished, that I was forced to delete it after 20 minutes. By now Running With Scissors forums officially call P3 'rip-off made by Akella' and unfortunately that's all you need to know.   Stay away!!!

2593	0	a	I'm not going to claim that 'Postal 2' was a masterpiece of the art form. It wasn't. It was trashy, poorly coded, and its humour was more groan worthy than anything. But goddamit, it WAS fun in some sick, twisted way - particularly when aided by the 'A Week in Paradise' mod that expanded its variety and fixed a lot of its bugs, etc. It was a cathartic experience that let you indulge in a bit of depravity to let the stress flow by. 'Postal III' on the other hand, is a torture simulator at the players expense - not the NPCs. This game is abysmally bad. The hit detection is the worst I've ever experienced in a game, and even when you do hit there's no sense of tactile feedback. There is not a single weapon in this game, except perhaps the Badger, that is in any way satisfying to use. About the only praise I can give this game in ANY sense is that while the humour is still pretty rank, there are a few more genuinely good, surreal jokes that might hit low brow sensibilities. I actually did laugh once or twice when the joke wasn't 'Misogyny/gross stuff' etc. This is the most broken â™¥â™¥â™¥ game I've ever seen released that took so long to make, this was in development as far back as 2004 and yet it feels like a proof of concept alpha - a proof of concept that in any true quality assurance workers mind, would not see as proving any viable concept at all. Its linear, broken, and practically unplayable. Say what you will about Postal 2 and its flaws - but at least everyone can agree that this one is legitimately pure â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2594	0	a	If you loved everything about POSTAL 2 you are going to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate this game; I gurantee it. Tho it is in itself a unique adventure, it is a disgrace to the second, Dude sounds like he is trying way to hard to sound like POSTAL Dude. The gameplay is mediocore and the switching between weapons gets very difficult when they decide to bind a whole â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ load of random keys to weapons. The story ends before it even really begins and ther eisnt the free roam and exploring as there was in POSTAL 2. I will admit some of the speech in the game is rather humorus, you are better off just watching the cut scenes on youtube.
2595	0	a	There is simply NOTHING good about this game. Think of everything that was fun about Postal 2 and none of that is in Postal 3. This is a really god awful 3rd person shooter with terrible gun combat mechanics, a broken melee system with horrible hit detection, and remember the open world non linear structure of Postal 2? Well now it's 100% linear. It wasn't until months after its release that they put in an open world mode which is just a save file with the whole city and no missions. That was the only midly decent thing in the whole game. Another thing that sucks is that they don't even have the Postal Dude's voice actor from the last game.  Do you want to know what the worst part of this game is? A good 80-85% of the game are escort/protection missions. Apparantly in Russia game devs think that gamers LOVE escort missions with the worst AI so they should make that the focus of the game. Because when you think Postal, you totally think of escort missions. Maybe that's what was missing from Postal 1&amp;2. The game's long series of escort missions involve never ending spaws of enemies who all have one goal which is to kill your target and shoot at you. The guy you protect has no logic, they just stand there getting shot until they die. In missions where you need to follow someone to a goal, they often just stop or get stuck on something while the endless enemies kill them. When it comes to protecting someone in a single location, it's more of the same, they stand in once place and get shot to death.  The story is passable, but you can watch all the cut scenes on YouTube and save yourself $20. One thing that was promised was branching story paths with real drastic changes to the plot, like what jobs you have, such as being a cop or a terrorist, or even running for president. The reality is that the game has a karma meter and the more innocents that die in your crossfire, the more the meter turns evil which puts you on the evil path. One of the first 'evil' missions has you on a cult where you use their version of the Gravity Gun from Half-Life to suck up apples and shoot them in barrels, 100 apples. They actually thought this would be fun. In the end, it's the same old crap, and I never did find a way to gain moral points. You just lose morality from accidently killing people with the terrible controls.  That's the whole game. There's a ton of escort missions, really bad shoot 'em up levels that have terrible level design (often getting you lost,) tons and tons of glitches, a variety of weapons, but none of them are that useful, the worst AI possible, weak voice acting, a lame story, and the creators of Postal had nothing to do with the making of this game, they infact disowned this game and pulled it from their web store. I remember a lot of critics hating Postal 2 and giving it crazy low scores without even playing it, but this game actually deserves to be bashed. There's just nothing fun about it. Not even mods could ever fix this mess of a game.
2596	0	a	This game is the biggest turd... it is so bug ridden that it is embarrasing. All the stupid things should add up to something fun in a dumb way, but because everything functions so poorly it ends up being frustrating. Also I have no idea who at RWS said that this game, essentially Postal 2 with updated graphics, should be third person. Whoever suggested it should be forced to play this game for hours on end, and believe me when I say that is quite the sadistic torture.

2602	0	a	Avoid. The gameplay mechanics and game theme are all messed up in this 'upgraded' version. Running With Scissors tried something different by partnering with a different company and ended messing up. The game is broken and feels like a demo. Go Postal 2, it is superior in every aspect beside graphics.
2603	0	a	Avoid this game. Here's why it is delayed: Valve wants a complete game on Steam. Duke Nukem Forever may have been dated and buggy, but when compared to Postal 3, DNF suddenly turns into Skyrim quality entertainment.
2604	0	a	This game is horrible.. running with scissors even tries to deny having anything to do with it, which I do not blame them. Full of bugs, repetitive gameplay and nothing like the previous in the series.
2605	0	a	'What an excellent and profitable game POSTAL 2 is, I wonder how we can profit from it more.' 'Hey vince, I got an idea. Let's get some unexperienced ruskies to develop a terribly buggy and raunchy third sequel that everyone will blame us for and want our severed heads on stakes in their front garden.' 'That sounds like an EXCELLENT idea, let us get to it right now then we can make some real dosh'    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXatquVqAc 
2606	0	a	This game is like The room of video games, not to inculde that alot of people where waiting for Postal 3 and they gave us this but lets just say this, its so bad that its oddly good, in the way that this entire game is a joke that needs to be laughed at and mocked so we never repeat this, and because of it we get the true 'Postal 3', Paradise lost, so just remember that some bad things can lead to the good things,  Thank you RWS for making great games, and sorry you had a big bump in the road of success.
2607	0	a	The Most Crap Postal Game i ever played just buy 1 and 2 to make up for this bugged up abomination that holds the postal name
2608	0	a	From my original review, Postal III was a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ awful sequel to Postal 2.  However, let's take it back a few notches.  Postal III is a third person shooter, unlike Postal 2, which was a first person shooter. The game, gameplay wise, is similar to Postal 2. You shoot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and perform tasks. However, Postal III introduces alignment. You can be good, or bad, and depending on your actions, you get different endings. For example, helping cops bust a hippie pot ring aligns you Good. Killing everyone during the bust aligns you Bad. That is a pretty cool feature that makes this game one of the more unique Postal games.  The game makes outside references to the likes of people such as the infamous director Uwe Boll, Gary Coleman from Postal 2, and other such things. It's got the Postal feel, and everything that is there is great, but it doesn't work all the time.  That's really my only main complaint with the game. Due to layoffs and rushes, the game is extremely buggy, and crashes often. The game runs on Valve's Source Engine.  Postal III on the inside has all the mechanics and gameplay aspects to make a good Postal game. However, on the outside, it's a buggy mess that crashes often, has gameplay breaking bugs such as cutscenes not playing, parts of the map unrendering, and other such things.   It's price isn't really warranted, considering it is a buggy crashing mess. If you get it gifted, or buy it out of curiosity, you might be dissapointed, but the game itself is still enjoyable if you can look passed it's flaws.
2609	0	a	Like Postal 2? Well keep playing it. This game blows â™¥â™¥â™¥. Simple as that.
2610	0	a	this is a really bad sequel to postal 2. you should think that with the source engine it would be a great experience, but no.  you cant feel that your are playing with the same engine as the half-life 2 series. i would consider my self a fan of postal 2 and the movie, so the only thing making this game worth bying is the humor, thats just as insane as the rest of the postal branch, but not surprised that this game got such a lawsy metascore.
2611	0	a	The game was amusing at times and on it's own I guess was playable once but it just did not live up to my expectations obtained from many play throughs of postal II. I suppose if you are a fan the series and it's going cheap it might be worth it but don't expect to much.
2612	0	a	Jesus they butchered this game so much.. Im only 1 hour in and im wondering wtf this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is. It feels like a half-life 2 mod with different models. Not postal at all. Do yourself a favor and go buy Postal 2 and play that instead.
2613	0	a	  This game is horrible.    And when I say horrible, I mean literally the worst game I have ever played, in my entire life. Node graph errors occur every time you play this game, and you will always expect some sort of graphical issue when playing this title. Akella has ruined the macabre concept of the Postal Dude, getting a new voice actor, and removing jumping and replacing it with a faulty cover system.  Hell, the only way to have fun in this game is heavily mod it. The only realistic model in this game is of Postal Dude, with every single civilian appearing to be a cartoon character from a Disney film. Commanding Champ to take out enemies just straight up doesn't work, you are better off using the helper monkey which appears literally once in the game. The third person view is not that bad, but then you realize Akella probably did that to make the Postal series more like a GTA clone.   The whole good/bad paths in the game do not mean anything. In a game where you can amputate a mans arm, throw it at another person, all while urinating on them, the game punishes you severely for doing anything close to bad. And if you select the good path, the game is no fun, whatsoever. Nobody confronts you (except Osama Bin Laden) and because the game is on rails, being wanted by the police means nothing. There isn't even a system that allows you to know you are wanted, you just do soemthing, and every single officer unloads on you. To make that worse, you can't evade them until you die.  The high note in this game is the weapons. I mean, a badger on a stick that you can have maul people to death, it's crazy. Krotchy doll nukes, the shop-vac, all were great ideas, but had a very poor execution.  The demo shown in 2007 had better graphics, gameplay, and overall feel than this game. At best, this is something a college student would make in Unity3D. 3.5/10  
2614	0	a	Postal III was a disgrace. Not with the story , ideas, or concept, BUT WITH overused / stupidass jokes, A different Voice Actor for Postal Dude, bugs, and most of all the melee weapons. It took you 10 punches and kicks to kill a man with bare fists. 
2615	0	a	Akella's POSTAL Spin off (AKA Postal III) is a game I would no longer recommend to anyone. It's full of bugs and glitches, most of the weapons are rubbish, the AI is horrendous, the frame rate will randomly shoot down at times, no free roam for you until you finish the story and despite the fact that this game was released in 2012 in the UK and Europe, it's using the same version of the Source engine that was used in Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Akella and TrashMasters have completely abandoned the game, so why should you buy this unfinished mess?   Most of the staff at Running With Scissors don't even like this game. If you want to play a good Postal game, buy Postal 2.
2616	0	a	Don't buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game. Even if it's for free don't get it. It's like putting bleach in your eyes. Even the original developers of Postal I and II condemn it. It's so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad. Just don't make the mistake I made and buying this thing.
2617	0	a	Not at all like Postal 2. Made on the Source engine and being a third-person shooter, wrechs the game even more.  Like Postal 2 don't play Postal III.

2620	0	a	This game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2621	0	a	This might just be the worst game I ever payed for.
2622	0	a	Unfortunately for RWS, this game was really badly developed and completely unoptimized. It's not their fault as they handed the development off to a russian company that started having financial troubles and had to lay off their prime team because they couldn't afford to pay them anymore. Instead, they fell back to the backup team which couldn't handle most of the intended design, and the game had to be extensively redesigned to accomodate their lack of experience and skill. I believe the company has completely shut down now, and won't give RWS the source code so they could properly clean it up and perfect it. Instead, RWS has chosen to abandon this horrible game, and resume working on Postal 2. Buy that instead, don't waste your money on this game! (they're working on a new DLC for Postal 2 right now!)
2623	0	a	Not Bad But not good either i played this for a bit then got bored of there crappy AI they get stuck behind walls none stop!  Also enemys can stand in front of a door so you can get through then there hands come through the door so you can still kill them but there bodys block the door so it is impossible and half the time it dosent even work!!!! over all good killing but bad AI. if you are looking for a disapointment get this game.
2624	0	a	* Well to sum it up, the problem of this game is that is just plain boring, it fails to recapture the ridicolous morbid fun of its predecessor.  * The graphics are good, it runs on Source Engine and looks alright to me, although there some mighty performance glitches with frame rate dropping. * The open world is there partially, but you cannot complete missions as you like but have to stick to the main story line.  * You revisit the outdoor locations several times during the game, which gets repetitive and the task you get are one stereotype. * You collect something, then all of sudden there is a riot by some of the minorities or some other group of extremists, which you have to eliminate. * You cannot get inside any building, you can take a look indoors only during missions, which is a nice change of pace, then you go back outside to one of the three main locations: downtown of city, mexican border or some kind of farm. * I loved Postal 2 for not being the perfect game, but for trying not to be convetional and yet entertaining, but this one just couldn't hold up its potential.
2625	0	a	Postal 2 is a much better game. Go buy that instead the devs are still working on it. This is just bad.
2626	0	a	not as fun as the second game
2627	0	a	Utter wank.Do not buy this travesty,stick to Postal 2.
2628	0	a	Worst game I have ever played, nothing like Postal 2.
2629	0	a	NO UNCLE TIMOTHY I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY PANTS OFF!
2630	0	a	Go buy the Postal 2 series. Loved Postal 2. Played it for many an hour.   Don't waste your money on this. Regret buying it. I waited for damn near 10 years for this turd?
2631	0	a	Don't bother with this game. It's so riddled with bugs it's not worth playing. When the Russian developer took over the duties from Running With Scissors they had no clue what a Postal game is supposed to be. Postal's about sick humor but giving you a mission that involves picking up used kleenex from a porno peep show is not just sick, it's just gross.   The controls are confusing, the graphics stuck in 2005 and the story disgusting. In short if the game is free and you're a 12 year old that likes to eat your own boogers this game is great...  
2632	0	a	I wouldnt have this game if Vince Desi didn't send it to me for free, lol. Thanks Vince glad you have had a little success with postal 2. Can't wait for something new from you guys ! Postal III=poop
2633	0	a	What can I say that would do Postal Triple justice? Huge let down? Sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥? Complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t?  No, none of these do justice to what a failure this game was. Hyped, hyped and hyped, but ultimately it is trying to mimic Duke Nukem Forever, which we all know is not a good thing. It tried to build off of contraversary and it failed miserably. The game is more or less just a constant 'look at me! Satire!' mess endorsed by Ron Jeremy.  Take my advice, don't buy this game. It's a buggy mess, the story is laughable and not in the funny way the developers want you to think, and on top of that, it's just not fun.  Generally that's what counts: the game isn't fun. Physics make for unfun combat, wonky AI makes for unfun enemies, unfunny story makes for unfun experience.
2634	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!! Made my computer crash dunno if it was cuz i was using non lethal force but my comp ended up not working for 5 minutes and then it took ages for the bios screen to even appear. Don't know what happened just glad i got a working computer its an i7 with 16gigs of ram I can't believe steam would sell this if there's a risk of it wrecking your computer. It should be taken off the store.
2635	0	a	This game sucks.
2636	0	a	Not even fun to play as a joke. Why would you take a great open world game with great jokes, and fun gameplay, then turn it into this piece garbage. dont buy it. If you think its like postal 2 but with better graphics, then youre wrong. Its poorly optimized, not open world, and glitchy as hell. Now i see why rws made an expantion to postal 2 4 years after this game came out. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME.
2637	0	a	Waste of money. I don't recommend this game. It was pretty disappointing
2638	0	a	Horrible. Camera angle makes it just plain anoying. While the setup and the comments and the storey were likely meant to be dark humor it just ends up being gross - which is an echevement on it's own.  Bad story, bad looks, bad controlls, bad camera, feels like one of low-budget games from 2000. Stay clear.
2639	0	a	at least without those negative comments and reviews we wouldnt have postal 2 on steam now
2640	0	a	Postal III. Where do i start. Well first of all this game is nothing compared to Postal, and Postal II. What this game can offer is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ source engine. With â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gameplay overall. If this game would have been first person with the old Postal II engine or something new (ANYTHING ELSE THAN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SOURCE ENGINE) i would have gladly finished through the game. But thanks Akella for ruining the game
2641	0	a	Wow. Talk about one of the worst products ever made, in just about every way possible. Unlike the previous postal, the game/level design is painfully linear with little to no room to explore. The third-person POV also feels really awkward, and using weapons and such feels really clunky. Loading times are atrociously long and the game itself is full of bugs that will probably never be fixed.  What's worse than all those things is that Postal 3 was really poorly optimized. It doesn't matter whether your gaming rig is decent or top-notch, you'll get random lagspikes and frame drops. Oh and the game crashes entirely too often, and for no apparent reason. Certainly not the game I was expecting, considering this game took several years of waiting to come out...ugh. The humor also feels really offensive, in Postal 2 the humor felt at least somewhat funny, but in Postal 3 it feels like they were being offensive for the sake of being offensive.  In short, Postal 3 felt like a huge waste of money and time I've spent playing it. RWS themselves deny having anything to do with Postal 3, and the gamers themselves refer to it as 'the russian postal' instead of a sequel. After playing it, I can hardly blame them. 0.5/5.0
2642	0	a	When it takes over 5 minutes just to load up the game and get to some gameplay, you know something is a miss. When the gameplay later on is so terrible and badly programmed so that you need a handful of luck to even get passed the tutorial, you know you have a real turdsandwish in your hands.  Do not buy this game. It's nothing like the series earlier installmeants.
2643	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!   Even now that it's finally on sale for a very low price of 4.99 I still have to say that you should not spend money on this. The game is extremely buggy, the combat barely works, the crosshair doesn't actually show where you're aiming with most weapons, grenades fall through the floor, the game stutters during gun fights on a way more than capable machine. Don't buy this game, get Postal 2 paradise lost instead. I'm getting a refund for this right now.
2644	0	a	Tons of bugs make Postal III totally unplayable.

2649	0	a	wow what happend to postal? Postal 2 was amazing and funny but what is this?  also it crashes all 20min it is not enjoyable!!!!
2650	0	a	I loved postal 2, and this is not postal 2. Long story short a different company landed the rights to make the game, tanked, and absolutely blew it.  It's level based, boring, and there is no open world game mechanic.  1/10, you f*cked with a classic, that really sucks.
2651	0	a	After I bought Postal 2, i saw that there was a third one and it had modern-day graphics and i thought that was pretty cool and then I saw all the negative reviews except for the literally only postive review and i thought to myself, hmmm I wonder how bad this game is? Seeing as how the second one was badass and amazingly better than some of the AAA games we get served today, so i bought it, played it and beat it, and now i now why this game is slandered, even RWS has given up on this trainwreck but before i trash this game more i have to say there are parts of this game that are good but far from being awesome.  Like my review of Postal 2, this review will broken down in the same areas  Gameplay, Graphics, Sound and most importantly Story  Warning: this is my opinon and if anything offends you, i deeply apolgize  Gameplay 5/10: the overall gmeplay isn't all to bad, the controls aren't bad but they are a big difference from its predecessor, the main control feature i like about this game is you don't have to use the mouse scroll for changing your guns, you can now use X and C for that which for me (being a console gamer for 16 years) is a big up for me since i'm still new to the PC controls. The game praises it's so called 'advanced AI' but in reality the so-called 'advanced AI' isn't so advanced unless advanced AI means running in your line of fire and killing all the 'advanced AI' in like two seconds  Graphics 6/10: the graphics of this game are not that bad but also not that good for a game that was realeased in 2011. there are times where the graphics acutally look complete and then other times your face palming with more regert than Patrick Stewert.  Sound 8/10: this is the only department that this game did good in. The BGM of this game is amazing, the only time the BGM is bad, is that it is stuck in a never-ending loop, so in the longer levels in the game it starts to become a ear ache. The sound F/X of this game is why the sound gets an 8 out of 10 instead of being a perfect score, the gun noises in this aren't as realistic as they were Postal 2, but they aren't horrible either, at least they are actually sounds instead of one guy making 'pew-pew' noises.  Story 6/10: the only reason this game's story did better than Postal 2 is because it's more of a linear based game, so there is more room for story, but the main reason ot only did a point better was becasue it's story was all over the f***ing place, when i finally beat the game, i had no f***ing idea what the f*** happend, the story has more holes in it than swiss cheese or a Micheal Bay movie (uggh don't get me started on him)  Overall 4.5/10: Overall this game needs A LOT more work and if it was developed on for a little bit longer (i'd say like two more years) it may have been a better game but I personally think that it should have been the exact same game as the second but with a new story and graphics like Halo 3. (ahhh if only) But before i go, the nic people over at Anthology Production, are making a mod for Postal 2, and it's basically taking Postal 3 and putting it into the engine of the second game and more! So i cannot wait for it to come out. so as you can see I do NOT reccomend this game but if you really want to play this s***ty game than wait for that mod.
2652	0	a	The game is buggy, broken &amp; sometimes unplayable.   I get to around chapter 3 &amp; can't progress any further because of constant crashes or glitches. The game hasn't seen any fixes either. I honestly can't recommend this game unless one day the devs decide it's worth fixing. Even then the humor is tasteless &amp; might have been funny or offensive in the early/late 90's. Now, it's just childish &amp; sad really.  If they ironed out the bugs it would be a decent 3rd person toilet humor shooter but with all the bugs, glitches, crashes &amp; other problems the game has it's just a chore to try and play through it.  I got this game when it came out, too. What a waste of money.

2654	0	a	This game could have been fun. Too bad it sucks major â™¥â™¥â™¥ !!!
2655	0	a	Postal III is a janky, barely functional mess that has none of the charm, character, or fun of Postal 2. Running With Scissors had little to do with this game and it shows. The game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (if you can get it running at all), and the first person, open world nature of the second game is replaced with boring, medicore, third-person cover based shooting. Oh yeah, don't forget everyone's favorite: A shallow binary moral choice system! Going around on rampages is still somewhat fun, but there is no heart or soul in this game. If you are an abosule, diehard Postal fan, pick it up on sale as cheap as you can if you're into some casual masochism. Otherwise avoid like the plague.  Also, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the Postal Dude's new voice.

2660	0	a	-Awfull Grapics -Awfull Gameplay -Game Crashed 14 times in 2 hours -Looks like Postal 2 -3rd person suddenly ? -Idiotic AI -Grapical Glitches -Fun weapons -Over the top crazy stuff  All in all the game sucks big time for the fact that it has more bugs then is funny, I can live with the poor grapics and the idiotic AI, What is not acceptable is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 3rd Person view wich makes aiming a hell, The fact that the AI is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and attacking them seems like your attack some sort of weird dummy, Overal very disappointing A giant downer to all the fans   Running with Scissors you should be ashamed to have produced this, I have seen freeware games made by amateurs wich easily are better then this.  -a hint to all DO NOT BUY THIS GAME- (sorry RWS but I cant recommend this it feels like a crappy game from 2006)
2661	0	a	Don't. Just...don't.  I liked Postal 2, because it was...different.  Sure, it was different mostly in awful ways, but the gameplay was tolerable, and the story &amp; content was unique (because they really didn't give a fâ™¥ck about 'acceptable behavior' like those wussies that made Grand Theft Auto III), so it was a guilty pleasure, if not necessarily an 'overly' pleasurable one.  Postal III, though? Ugh.  In a franchise that (let's be honest) is constantly *trying* to offend you, it probably will as much as Postal 2 did, and this one still has that 'don't give a fâ™¥ck' attitude.  But the gameplay, graphics, animation, all the video game-specific elements were shâ™¥t.  It's become South Park ca. 2013. No, really. In many ways. The  worst  ways.  - It's created this pedigree of offensive humor, doing things and saying things that no one's heard, and things you wouldn't repeat in front of Mom &amp; Dad. - It continues to be 'taboo', even though it's novelty is years dead. - The intense focus on continuing to offend (while running out of taboos) has gotten to the point that they succeed in being contraversial, but have  COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN HOW TO BE FUNNY ANYMORE . - The franchise should've died out somewhere around 2008, leaving fond memories for fans, not disappointment to *former* fans.  ...see?  All those are just like modern South Park. (sigh)  In one particular scene a...'mustachioed' Q-list celebrity has to make a speedy exit, and since the camera shows the scene's actors from the knees up, they just push the fâ™¥cker across the screen, without bothering to animate his legs, and make Mel Blanc-type running sound.  I haven't bought as many games as some, but have bought more than most, so this statement may mean less, but it's nonetheless true:  This is the first video game I've ever bought that I truly regret getting.
2662	0	a	Horribly disgusting game. Postal and Postal II were great, but this was just a heaping pile of trash with the name added in as a money grab.
2663	0	a	$20 for this? really?
2664	0	a	I can see that you're thinking of buying this. You're thinking 'Aha! Postal 2 was great, I want to try this too!' NAY I TELL YOU! Sure, there are a few hours of fun in here, but it's absolutely nowhere near as good as Postal 2 was. On top of that it's buggy and it feels like it was released while it was still in Beta development. I uninstalled it in frustration and disappointment.
2665	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful. I liked Postal 2, even though a lot of people turned their noses up at it, but this is unadulterated dogshit. Don't even buy it in a Steam sale. Only ever play it if someone agrees to remunerate you. HANDSOMELY.
2666	0	a	This is one of the buggiest games I've ever played: constant crashing, game breaking bugs, the works. Long story short, it was developed by a different developer than the one that made the first two Postal games, and it was released in alpha and seemingly abandoned. Do not buy.
2667	0	a	This game is an absolute wreck. It runs very unstable, there are a lot of glitches that lead me to believe that this game was published in its alpha stage as complete. The story itself is very bland and the humor... you can't really call that humor at all, it's just really bad and tries way too hard to be funny, comming across like a 10 year old wrote the jokes.  I can't recommend this game at all and apparently the owners of the franchise rights can't recommend it either.
2668	0	a	Half good gameplay with a sprinkle of humour drowned in bugs and repetitive sauce Do yourself a favor and get postal 2, better game on all points
2669	0	a	I cant even open the game without it crashing within 30 seconds. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME... I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
2670	0	a	A truly awful and linear game. It is just the exact same thing over and over. Postal 2 was stupid, pointless, and fun. Postal 3 is stupid and pointless.
2671	0	a	There's a reason that after about a year; this game is half price. It sucks. In fact, it sucks so bad Running With Scissors doesn't even consider it a Postal game and calls it a 'spin-off'. Akella did nothing but suck this game up with a horrible story-line, clunky controls, and bugs out the wazoo. Avoid this game. You don't want it. You'll get fustrated after an hour and give up. I personally waited and waited for this and when I got it; was highly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off I'd wasted $40 on this garbage. Don't waste $20; don't waste $10, seriously, this game is not even worthy of the $.99 bin.
2672	0	a	I keep trying to play this game, just to see if it's me or not. Unusual and awkward controls and quite frankly rubbish graphics makes this much anticipated game a very large disappointment.
2673	0	a	Complete waste of $10. Bugs bugs bugs, and it won't launch in Windows 8.1.
2674	0	a	It's what you would expect from a Postal game as far as the humor and violence goes. Can't say I like the 3rd person perspective; it would be fine if it wasn't so clunky. The game is buggy and running on the source engine it should be a lot smoother. The game is no longer open world, but it tries to give some good/bad choices to make but they don't seem to make a huge difference. The game makes fun of how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it is, with stuff popping up on the screen like 'Postal Babes are on your side, so good luck not killing them in this AI clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! HAHAHAHAH.' Wait for a $10 sale or at least until some mods come out and bugs are fixed.

2685	0	a	The worst game I have ever played. Ever. Out of tons of other crappy games in the 30+ years I have played video games. Even Pong was done with more care than this POS was. There are so many things wrong with it, I could go on forever.  Play Postal 2 instead.

2691	0	a	oh Postal III, why did i buy you? you're are not worth of my money, and the game i'snt that great. want to play Postal? play POSTAL 2 and the original, this so called 'Sequel' is'nt worth of you're money
2692	0	a	I only wish refunds were available when this released.
2693	0	a	I have played postal 1 and postal 2 with the 1337 patch a long long time ago (to make it work properly on really old systems) and i have postal 2 on steam now, so essentially i have paid to that game twice now, actually 3 times as i bought it off rws website quite a few years ago as a digital download (non steam related). To be honest i dont mind as its a great game to play and still makes me laugh (good on ya running with scissors). However, i am a PC owner and a FPS player and i am a very dissapointed that this latest incarnation has turned into a TPS and appears to be a port from a console game. Not a happy bunny RWS, i should have taken on board what some of the others had said.
2694	0	a	Wasted my 5e on sale i do instant refund i thinked i will enjoy this game but i be wrong
2695	0	a	Wow were to begin... well im Far over the system rec...8 core 4,01 GHZ . 16 gb system ram. gefore 680 gtx 2gb.. still first 2-3 missions around 60fps. after that its a lag fest around 14-22 fps and 15 crashes before i got past the uwe boll thingy... no spoilers...  Havent finished it but game is kinda postal fun but way to crahsy for me.  still whats not to hate/love about postal?.. hate the game and all its mechanics... but the story is ok.. dont expect postal 2 gameplay.. and hey its a story so dont expect a postal game.  Still like the fact theat they braught a story in. but still all game mechanics suck. but cant really stop trying doe.  God game just not wurth any cash its not finished and probably never will be.

2702	0	a	This game is like that creepy uncle that everyone denies being apart of the family  Get the Postal II. There's better offensive stereoypes.
2703	0	a	If you grew up and loved the series like me then skip this motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Even though i got this on sale its still a waste of money.
2704	0	a	Wont activate. Sux. Don't buy this crap. Spams you with 'Activation denied by server' even when you literally just bought it. Have emailed support, no answer yet but this shouldnt happen anyway. Not hard to manager your license server up time.  lol GG
2705	0	a	I take two steps, I get gunned down by 5 guys, I have no weapons, I fall over and start kicking like a mad man, screen goes nuts, I aparently die, game crashes.  Worst 5 minutes of my life. Stay away from this buggy mess.
2706	0	a	I found Postal 2 one of my guilty pleasures but this game, whilst having its good moments, is a letdown. It feels unfinished and is buggy. The missions are repetitive. You dont expect much from a Postal game and although I finished the game, it was a chore to do so.
2707	0	a	WTF! Couldn't even get past pouring gasoline on zombies without it crashing.. twice!  The rest of the game seems kind of cheap too...
2708	0	a	The game isnt as good as the second, sure it is (little) fun but it is sad that it is so buggy.... It doesnt work on my Pc ( maybe will on yours) It wont continue. Keep in mind this s my review, you might like it.... :) buy the 2 if you want fun.
2709	0	a	Most of the protect things missions are hard to me but i dont know about everyone else.
2710	0	a	This was massively dissapoinying, and i even knew what i was getting in to when i first staretd. *sigh*  i supose i ought to explain so:   graphics are fine there is nothing i have problem with vidually (mayble blood effects but that ill adress later.) physics : passable nothing to complain about story : huh? like that ever mattered  and now on to important stuff atmosphere sucks, there is something about catarsis that just dose not work for me, something that was there in Paradise i can not quite explain it but it feels like lesser coppy of previous attempt in postal 2. combat mechanics are quite strange, i have had problems landing mele attacks, whener i managed to do so it never felt like it was something i did that made the attack land it seemed to me as tho it was chance. in here i would like to adress blood effect which managed to fail at being overexadurated squirts as in P2 but allso fell short of being reasonible representation of what i assume blood squirts would look like in real life as result of that one of main draws of previous two games is just not fun annymore. look if you are doing game with main focus on gross humor and carnage you must make them fun damit!  charakters of player and nonplayer origin are allso falling short of mark, honestly this feels like fan made mod than proper game.  sorry RWS this one is a failure 
2711	0	a	Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this is bad.  I mean I heard it was bad. And the last two games were bad games in their own ways as well. [NOTE: I am not talking about offensive content I am really talking about the quality of the games]. Postal 1 was an absolute mess, and a violent, attention whoring relic of early PC gaming, and Postal 2 was a short, glitchy, grotesque, and insanly racist piece of FPS history...  But this is more glitchy than it's predecessor, it lacks the 'charm' the previous game had, and it's not a sandbox! It's a poorly made 3rd person coverbased shooter that goes from bad cutscenes to bad gameplay back to bad cutscenes. THERE IS A FORCED TUTORIAL MISSION AT THE BEGINING CALLED 'CROSS THE BRIDGE' OR SOME â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND YOU MOSTLY CROSS THE BRIDGE IN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CUTSCENES!!!  Bottom line the Postal series is a game set in a shared universe that is full of crude, immature shock comedy... and that isn't a bad thing. Frankly, I'm nostalgiaic over the first one. I played it a lot as a kid and at the time I took the whole thing as a big joke meant to offend people (which a great portion of it reall is just that), and my cousin played it, I shared it with all my friends back when I had the physical copy... It's the worlds wierdest 'kids' game lol. BUT Postal 3 has horrible UI, hit detection, level design, has the worst graphics of a Source powered game that I've ever scene... Get Postal 2: Paradise Lost and the Workshop MODs. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Postal III!
2712	0	a	buggy, very laggy. i meet the reccommended requirements and it runs awful. cutscenes have choppy sound, and petrol is super hard to use. guns suck, except fro the m16, best gun imho.  i admit that my run issues probably stem from having to run this in wine, that said, ive run much more intesive games in wine on this system.
2713	0	a	Broken, thats the only word I can describe Postal 3, Poorly optimised and the terrible game design that is present through out both playthroughs of the game. Get Postal 2 instead, its not worth the money (Final score 2/10)
2714	0	a	Man I had so much fun with 'Postal 2' but this............was dissapointing! I mean people who play this on Youtube manage to have some fun with it but this is awful, it could be a fun game if you make fun of it with friends but other than that it sucks! Too much stupid and unwanted missions, no actual free roam where you can just mess around, crappy controls, and of course the cringe worthy dialogue. I got this game because I loved the sequel so much but this is just dissappointing! My review for this game..........It sucks! Wish I didn't waste my money on this stupid game! 
2715	0	a	My best friend gave me this for Christmas a long time ago and only now did I have a PC that can play it.  Lucky for him, we're not friends anymore, otherwise I'd have slapped him like you would slap a disobediant wife.
2716	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, don't play.
2717	0	a	I am running a good system but I have had nothing but trouble playing this game.(you dont need a super computer to run it)  1.Lagging very bad that the game is unplayable. 2.Unexpected game stops??? 3.Freezing in certain places and it does not recover. 4.The achievement made are not all on the steam account??? 5.Graphics just freeking out and changing to mad colours. 6.Sound sometimes goes into a loop.sticky 7.Transfer and loading is laggy and sticks but it recovers (but not always)  One problem is OK but seven..not on.  I do not recommend this game,I have played the other Postal games with no problems but this one is very bad. You would actually think it would be much better.I was hoping it would be better.  Not happy waisted money on it.lucky it was a reduced price.  Stop Running With Scissors and walk.
2718	0	a	The movie was waaaaay better than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2719	0	a	0/10 -no humour -controls -story -annoying main character -pathetic missions
2720	0	a	This game is a waste of Money. I cannot even Start The game up OR GET TO THE START SCREEN! Just Stay away. And if you know how to fix this. Message me!
2721	0	a	Bobbing, straight running, unreadable small text, Grafix did not improve, animations SUX...  I wasted years waiting for this junk.  Go and run with a scissors, RWS!
2722	0	a	Personly it sucks.
2723	0	a	I had a bit of fun with Postal 2 back in the day so when Portal 3 promised me a honey badger as a weapon and a better camera for the game I threw my money at this once it was on sale. As I purchased and installed this game I found the free roaming atmosphere that left the world open in the previous game where choice was key to story progression had been replaced with a small linear map that pushed obnoxious cutscenes in our face with a voiceover that screams 'I'm trying to sound like Duke Nukem.' The worst part is that this game actually gave me herpes. As I played this game I found that my fingers started breaking out in blemishes which then spread to my arms. Before anything could spread further the honey badger jumped out of the screen and ripped out my jugular. With my last breath I write this review. Please tell my family I'm sorry I bought this game.
2724	0	a	I thought I would enjoy this even with the negative reviews. It's bad like broken everything, bad animation, really bad models, crap voice acting. Just all around bad. Don't play it , But if ya really wanna try it wait for a sale maybe worth 2 bucks
2725	0	a	This is the Duke Nukem Forever of the postal world only I could bring myself to play all the way through Duke Nukem and only played this game about 10 mins before walking off so I could complain about how bad the game is to a friend before coming back and uninstalling. Buy Postal 2 all day long as for 3 not even worth a quick play through.
2726	0	a	This game won't launch for me, though from what I can tell from other reviews and videos: postal 3 is an unfunny, boring, very linear, broken, poorly programmed, mess.   It also doesn't have rick hunter as the postal dude which is a massive let down because rick is the postal dude, he just is the postal dude, the new person sounds nothing like him and it feels wrong for him to say lines from the first two games, though the new ones sound fairly good though it really ruins the character since the postal dude is like no other character in any video game.
2727	0	a	Postal 3 starts with Uwe Boll giving you the finger, in a loading screen. This follows through the missions where it's apparent that the game it's just trying to mess with the player but not in the good old fashioned Postal way. Postal 3 strives so far from both of it's predecesors that eventually it seems clear that Trashmasters (ironically) don't know even the involment that a player has when it comes to it's game, it expects you to sit throughout boring, unstilized missions, without any purpose or reason behind them.  Postal 3 it's the pinnacle of bad game design, and insultity for the pleyer and the series, i'ts the lame, pathetic excuse that comes from a group of people that believe comedy begins with a fart and ends with and insult, with people that make pathetic. lame jokes, thinking that what causes controversy and makes someone feel offended somehow it's an attractive point in entertainment. Shame.
2728	0	a	i only beat the game because i am a fan of postal. the game is buggy as hell. at a few points i couldnt beat the mission because it was so buggy. sound quality is awful. the game is held back, there is not enough player choice outside of joining good or bad. i wanted to say no and kill both sides and be my own dude, but the game just said no to me and threw me to the 'bad' side.

2730	0	a	The game is broken, if you email  'arkhipov@akella.com'  then we're likely to get the achievements fixed.   First impressions so far.  I downloaded the game. (wish I hadn't). Clicked Play. I saw a picture of Uve Boll sticking his finger up at me, The game then crashed. Yep, that's basically my expectations for the rest of the game. I then started the tutuorial and was told to ingite some zombies. INGITE. (That's not my spelling mistake, that's exactly how it was spelt and what the game told me to do.  They've also slaughtered the Source engine, it's no wonder we don't have Half-Life 3. Valve had to make another engine after this game was released.  Also, for those of you that like your Source console commands and your Postal experience in 1st person mode. You get to eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because typing firstperson into the console tells you that the game is already in first person. (even though the whole game takes place in 3rd person). Entering thirdperson makes the camera aim straight at the floor. So instead of using the default 3rd person mode that Source uses they've decided to use the first person mode and pull the camera back, for some reason.   I was also told not to press a button, so I'm not whilst I currently wait for the game to progress. After I spent waiting the game started to insult me for doing exactly what it told me to do.   The people that made this game should kill themselves. I'm not joking. They've made a mess of the Source engine and a mess of the Postal series.
2731	0	a	It is the shiteist game ever buy postal 2 it works and is actuly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fun I wish i never bought this abomanation of a game this game killed the series and valve your machans dont work for this game and its in 3rd person no aiming and the brige took me 30 min just to finnish sorry if i misspeled i am just so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off
2732	0	a	Very Bad Game Postal 2 is more good
2733	0	a	The game has it's charm. But i'm much more the FPS version. Also too much loading between the maps hardly make it 'open world'.
2734	0	a	Honestly not worth $20. It looked fun from the trailer but ened up being a crap game with horroble story and gameplay. Metascore was generous of giving it a 24.
2735	0	a	I love Postal and all, but postal 3 was totally trashed, the game is a nutshell of crashes and bugs, i wish i could play this to the end, but even that is impossible due to the fact this game crashes every 5 min from every little thing that pops out.  If you look to play Postal, just buy POSTAL 2.
2736	0	a	If you are even remotely thinking of buying this game, go buy Postal 2 first. Postal 3 is developed by Trashmasters (some would say they 'trashed' the game) and published by Akella (as opposed to Running with Scissors who both published an developed the previous game). Trashmasters left out the key concepts that made Postal 2 a good game. Very much a linear game no open world. The only benefit of playing this game is that when you eventually play Postal 2 it looks like a frikin' masterpiece compared to this.
2737	0	a	This is an extremely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game the metascore pretty much says it all.
2738	0	a	The most shortest game ever made! 11/10 - IGN
2739	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game, buy postal 2 instead
2740	0	a	this game is a waste of pixels and time. Its a huge piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, do not buy or play it.
2741	0	a	ItÂ´s for sure the worst game i know... if you buy it, you will regret it!
2742	0	a	Really not woth it.   Better to keep on playing postal 2.
2743	0	a	DONT BUY THIS CRAP - wow i played it for a long (0,7 hrs) time but i dont have any patience to play THIS any more...uninstalled.. I should trust the score of 24/100 
2744	0	a	So,i have been a big fan of postal 2 in the past for it is one of my favorite games. Back in 2011 i find out that the third postal game was released,So i heard bad reviews so i did not get the game until 3 yrs later (2014) i had a steam card and i had some money left so i thought what the heck i should buy the third postal game,ummm...so i did and well...this game has ruined the postal 3 franchise! it is terrible for it is filled with forced jokes and glitches EVERYWHERE! listen if this means anything to you,don't buy this game PLEASE BUY POSTAL 2!
2745	0	a	They didn't even bother to make a game out of this ... I had high hopes for this but it ended up being very disapointing. What little gameplay there was ... was very simple and boring. Refund! &gt;:(
2746	0	a	Crashes constantly, doesn't control well, isn't funny, doesn't feature a sniper rifle, limits the player too much, and it takes way too many bullets to kill average people. Most of what made the previous game fun is lost. Due to the constant crashing, I really wish I hadn't spent $20 on this. If I could uninstall for a refund, I wouldn't hesitate.
2747	0	a	Broken combat, horrible story, and game crashes after swat level so it's impossible for me to complete. Absolute garbage. Play Postal 2.
2748	0	a	It sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and does the franchise more shame than Uwe could do with all of the nazi gold in the world. I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate you Akella. Why not go full bankrupt if you go full â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and release such an unfinished unpolished piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥ trash anyway?
2749	0	a	Be carefull. Game is not running on Windows 8. :(

2753	0	a	how the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this game still considered 'mixed'
2754	0	a	I bought this game for 6 dollars, but it doesn't work! Serial code error! Why? I payed money, but my serial code is not working! Don't buy this game!
2755	0	a	Postal 3 is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! I'm â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in serious!  This game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in bomb and its one hell of a bad bomb. The gameplay is buggy as hell, the cutscenes are annoying, AI is terrible, missions are lame, story didn't make much sense, too much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is in your way, you get lost very easily, jokes are unfunny, Postal Dude's voice actor is different (not that it matters), and a whole bunch os other crap that made this game suck so hard. Even though this was on the Source engine, I know Valve was pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at these guys for makin it suck so bad. Pretty much a good reason why Valve didn't want this game to be released on STEAM on its release date so the developers had to make it where you have to purchase on their own website.  Do yourself a favor and don't spend your $40 on this horrible game. If you were DARED to buy this and play it all the way to the end, just remove that friend. Postal 2 is a lot more better than this...hell Duke Nukem Forever is better than this pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  1/10!...NO MAKE IT -1/10! AVOID IT!
2756	0	a	i feel violated and not in a good way
2757	0	a	just buy postal 2 and not this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2758	0	a	What ever you think this game is going to be, it's worse.
2759	0	a	I feel like i have brain cancer now let me tell ya about it!  The npc's will aim at each other throught walls making a FOLLOW ME! mission annoying as hell. The third person makes things like gasoline and aiming useless.  And if you have a computer that can run games pretty good. Not somthing like a mega machine but it can run games ok. THEN DONT GET THIS GAME!   all the level's are completely massive and have textures that lag the game for no reason and because these level's are massive half of the level you dont see anyway. Because you either get chased by 10 enemy's with melee weapon's or your objective is in a set area so there is no piont of exploreing anyway!  The jokes are either completly bad or pretty funny more bad than good thought. lip synce is terible people will talk and continue to move thier mouths.  The mission are also bad too the story is 'He walks here he does this. He goes there he does that.' There is no variation.  All the guns feel absolutly useless the only weapon you will use is the shotgun, rifle, or M-60. which pulls apart the jokes that can be made is you use the other weapon's.  The third person aim dot is WAY OFF were it is supposed to be you offter shoot a gun for 5 seconds before learning where the bullets are really going and push up your mouse to start hitting somone.  The toturial is a joke quick scene's of your character saying 'OOOOH!!! cool weapon' then a scene with small text tells you how to use the weapon.  I found no possitive in playing this game in fact I just bought postal 2 which i hear is a much better game then postal 3.  Which also makes me ask how is the pervious game better then the newest? I didn't know this was call of duty?!  I am telling you DONT BUY THIS GAME you will regret it just by playing level 1. When the only game that Running with scissors makes is postal I dont think they deserve my money when they have made no effort no produce another game.
2760	0	a	This is not a bad game apart from the DRM which is god awful and not supported in either Windows 7 or 10 i wish they'd patch that out if they did i might even recomend the game but while i can't play it i can't recommend it unfortunately go play Postal 2 it's much better and the developers (not the same as this game) actually care and still update the game to this day.
2761	0	a	what a horrible game, doesn't even support the xbox controller
2762	0	a	Just do not buy this scam. It is crashing after 1 min. It simply DOES NOT WORK.
2763	0	a	I'd rather draw blood from my neck than play this game for an extended period of time. The trailer says, 'could you ask for more?' Yes, yes you could. I would ask for a refund for this unfunny, boring, broken mess.
2764	0	a	Unfortunately, I'm not able to recommend this. Better use your money on Postal 2 with it's DLC, you'll be better off than with this :(
2765	0	a	Launched and re-launched 5 times due to random crashes (wasn't any specific trigger that froze the game), could not land a single punch despite slowly scrolling my mouse across the entirety of my targets, could not aim the gas can anywhere but directly at my feet, the can of poisonous catnip I was given to spray HIV-infected cats ran dry after hitting two cats (out of 15), the controls are wacky, the humor is low-lowl-low-brow and not well executed. I spent $20 on this. It's the last time I'll ever do an impulse buy at that price point on steam without hitting the web for reviews.
2766	0	a	Utter crap. Not worth a penny!
2767	0	a	Fun game. But lacks certain things that make the game fun and gives it its humor. Sadly, I donot recommand this game. Even though it is fun and I have gotten a few hours of fun out of it, The Bad stuff just Outweighs the good stuff.  A good buy if game is $5.00. But anything higher, Spend your money on somthing else.  4.5/10
2768	0	a	Awful waste of money.

2771	0	a	  The most bugged and unoptimized game on Steam. How did this even came to steam?  Everytime you run the game, it shows a new bug. It stutters on Win7, i7-4790K, gf780gt, 16gb ram... After editing the autoexec it worked quite well for a while. Today it started the game and it stutters everytime I move my mouse...
2772	0	a	One of the worst shooters ever made. Don't buy this, it's nothing like previous Postal games.
2773	0	a	This game is so bad the guys who developed the first two games have disowned it and deny it's existence. You would be well served to do the same.

2775	0	a	I love Postal 2! And I loved the humor and story of Postal 3. The only thing why I dont recommend this is the lackluster gameplay and the several technical Issues.  Pros:  + its Postal through and through, Sex , Violence, Racism, Animal Abuse and tons of other stuff that made this franchise famous + the story is pretty funny + many new and old weapons to choose from + a new city to explore + some celebrity characters + great sense of humor and satire + multiple paths to choose from, that actually change things up   Cons:  - on a technical side the game is a complete mess. So many bugs,glitches and crashes, I will point out the worst one by one - a bug caused one of my save games to crash on being loaded.....that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off so much since I was far into the game - ALL the mlee weapons are absolutley useless.....you cant hit anything because they are so extremley poorly programmed - hit detection is a absurd - 3rd person view is pointless and even worse can trigger bugs and camera glitches.......why not stick with first person? This is a major downer! - ranged weapons feel way off when aiming, you can hit your targets but it just feels so bad to aim - gasoline is buggy and doesnt work like in postal 2, you cant pour it onto people anymore, they have to walk on the ground youÂ´re pouring at (like I said, many special weapons are buggy) - way too many missions stick to the same formular - horde shooter where you have to take out certain people - many random crashes - you cant mount a cat on a gun -_- seriously whos decision was it to remove this feature? Its like one of the most iconic things in Postal 2! - the explorable city is pretty small, there isnt much to actually do, I expected some kind of funny mini games, there are funny arcade cabins, but they are only cosmetic.....how disappointing - the enemy AI is none-existent.......they are so incredibly incompetent at doing anything - and like I said....many many bugs in missions and scripted events  Oh Postal.....I loved the second one, and the humor and one liners are back....but with such a horrible gameplay mechanics thats its barely playable. I played through the good campaign and it crashed too much on the bad campaign and I deinstalled in rage. If this gets waaaaay lower in price I can recommend this to a hardcore fan, other than that keep away from this.

2778	0	a	This game is glitchy, unpolished, and not worth your money.
2779	0	a	Waaay too many bugs and a horrible storyline. And on top of that this game crashes very frequently, for ANY spec computer. Terrible aiming mechanics (why do you need to hold both mouse buttons to throw a grenade???) , bland to poorly designed missions, a moral system that seems unnecessary, and it randomly chugs RAM for no apparent reason (poor optimization for ANY video cards). To put it simply, avoid this game at all costs.
2780	0	a	There aint anything but bugs and crashes. its damn amateur'ed that you havent found a solution for all theese bugs for us on windows 8 or 8.1 +---- So dissapointing to sit in 2 hours and wait for the download. just to throw and crash like it did a half year ago. this is an awesome game. and its really really shiotty of you steam.

If this gets waaaaay lower in price I can recommend this to a hardcore fan, other than that keep away from this.

IÂ´m disgusted by this game!! Play Postal II instead it has an open world and is less arcade.  Recommend it? Uhm.. let me think.. NO.
2786	0	a	Its still funny and what not but the story is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, no free roam, and just random activities to do that eventually bring in random violence and action that really makes the game mediocre and not a hint of logical sense of what happens

2790	0	a	  It's very hard to say how I feel about Postal 3.    I'd star off by saying it's a broken piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. It really is. It's broken all the way down to the achievements. It's extremely linear and the 'free roam' maps are small as hell. when you initially play, your like wtf did I just play, but then, you play the good side of the story. -- I even hate to say this but the good story version of the game seemed to be more of a overall game, even the boss fights were actually boss fights to an extent...    (the ending was actually pretty epic with the tank battle)     The fact that this alone allows you to draw out the gameplay factor a bit does kind of give it a replay value... Kind Of.... This is when 17 levels actually becomes 27 levels and you actually kinda feel bad for the game, because you start to see it's potential..... This is when you really want to give it   At Least a 7/10   but ... you know it's   really a 5/10   and you can't recommend it to anyone because it's very incomplete....  ____   5/10   ____  Maybe someday a team will come along and fix it.

The missions are terrible and the 'humor' is completely cringy. You know when something is so bad, it's good? This is NOT the case. This is beyond any kind of bad. Avoid like the plague.

2806	0	a	Hey it is finally on steam! This game will likely get low scores and upset fanboys because it comes accross as a parody of itself. Anyways: It is a Third Person action game with tons of random and sick humor in small mission based levels.   The method you use to solve the missions are very limited compared to Postal 2 because either you do things in a evil way or a good way... how you do the missions results in what type of mission you do next.   You could play the whole game killing everyone and getting evil missions or as a cop doing good things and saving people. The whole game has alternative pathways so since I did a good guy, I missed at least 1/3 of the game of bad guy levels.  The weapons are fun and killing people is fun, but overall the game feels rushed and humor is forced. Not worth the $40.00, but I could say it would be worth $20.00 if you love sick humor and killing people with strange weapons like killer Cats.

2824	0	a	When I saw this game got 75% off discount, I bought it then gave a negative comment at the same time.
2825	0	a	I cannot fathom that I paid money for this debacle of a trainwreck. The missions make no sense, the enemies are either too stupid to kill you; or, kill you in mere seconds without any chance of you doing anything about it.   The game runs at a staggering, mindblowing, ten frames per seconds at nearly all times. The voice acting is atrocious, the NPCs could not be any more vapid and shallow. The guns are unsatisfying, and most of the other weapons are just plain stupid and have no purpose other than shock value.   I can't wrap my mind around how this 'game' ever got the green light to get this far. Please, only consider installing this 'game' if they pay you to do so. Stay away from this distasteful, poor designed 'game' that was clearly made by immature ten-year-olds. Because, no matter how you slice it, it was clearly targeted for them, too. You have been warned.
2826	0	a	I cannot recommend this game, I would rather play Duke Nukem Forever and I really didnt enjoy that game. This game is buggy and runs like crap. Do NOT buy this game, I should have taken the hint when it wasnt originally available on steam at launch.
2827	0	a	20 wasted dollars and 13 wasted gigabytes  If you're gonna get into the Postal series, DO NOT pick this one up. Running with Scissors themselves even disowned it and retconned it out of the Postal canon.
2828	0	a	An amazing game, if your definition of amazing is a bug ridden turd with no redeeming qualities. Stick with Postal 2.
2829	0	a	Let's say that you're -- somehow -- a fan of Postal. You would still not enjoy this game. It doesn't break the fourth wall, the fourth wall doesn't exist in this game. You make decisions that affect the way you progress through the game, but even the joy of that is sucked out of this game... Because of this game. Not sure what made Running With Scissors take the leap from Unreal Engine in Postal 2 to Source in Postal III. Not sure what they expected in adding zombies to Postal, or forcing really annoying combat encounters, or never really giving you a moment to properly understand what's happening. This game tries too hard to be offensive, yet funny, to have stuff to do, in a world with nothing to do, to have a story in a series that never had one, and decals constantly overlap one another. Voice-acting is overall poor, and even for people that like low-brow humor (like myself) this game just takes it too far. It's not funny, it's just annoying.  + Kill Uwe Boll + Weapons + Postal violence  - Annoying fourth wall breaks - Possibly the worst use of Source Engine I've ever seen - Glitches galore! - Annoying voice acting - Never a moment's peace to explore and just do whatever I want, like in Postal 2 - Combat that's sometimes WAY too annoying - Zombies, in Postal - Tries too hard to do too many things at once

2833	0	a	What a disappointment. I wanted to like this game, I really did. I read that it was a decent RPG with good game mechanics and pretty graphics. However, in my experience, the most the game could muster from me is one giant 'meh.'  To start, the good points: Combat in Kingdoms of Amalur is by far it's best feature. Combat is fast, acrobatic, and exciting. Taking down mobs of enemies with a variety of weapons while dodging and firing off magic spells is an absolute highlight of this game. Controls are responsive and intuitive. Boss fights can be thrilling.   The voice acting in the game is definitely above average, if not very good. The main story quest (from what I got through) seems interesting. And the game definitely looks pretty, albeit more on the cartoony side than the likes of The Witcher or Skyrim (although that's not necessarily a bad thing.) Overall, what I read initially is not untrue; this is a decent RPG, good game mechanics, and looks pretty good.  Unfortunately, that's where the positives end and the disappointments begin.  Most glaring is, lest you be fooled, Kingdoms of Amalur IS NOT AN OPEN WORLD ENVIRONMENT. It is a series of corridors arranged in such a way as to give the illusion of one. Resource placement within this corridored environment is lazy, with resource generating plants conveniently located periodically along the periphery of said corridors. The side quests are similarly lazy and primarily consist of fetch quests (go and kill these guys, bring me back my ring. Collect a bunch of ingredients for potions to save the town, bring them back to me.)  Also, if KoA came any closer to straight ripping off elements of Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls series of games, I think we would have had a lawsuit on our hands. Equivalents of the Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild, and Theives Guild? Check, check, and check, Strikingly similar lockpicking mechanism/mini-game? Oh, you betcha. Alchemy, Blacksmithing, and Enchanting requiring specific workstations of each? Bingo. Hidden traps represented BY BEAR TRAPS, actuated spike tiles, and trip wires which set off various nasties. Yup. (I mean, the bear traps might have been the last straw for me).  KoA also suffers from trying to cram way too much weapon and item variety into the game than is necessary. The result is the player being positively overwhelmed by the sheer volume of useless crap you pick up during play. Luckily, it provides a convenient and free fast travel mechanism to travel back to nearest towns to unload your useless junk. Oh, and that reminds me, all the towns I visited were essentially carbon copies of each other, with the various crafting stations, a pub, and a couple of random houses in each.  While KoA definitely has it's high points -- with combat being at the absolute top -- it relies too heavily on overused RPG tropes coupled with a very heavy 'borrowing' of mechanics and game elements from other titles. It suffers from the developers trying to cram WAY too much content, instead of focusing on providing a smaller, truer open world environment, innovative mechanics and quests, and overall immersive experience. In the end, as pretty as the game can look at times, what the game is lacking is originality. The leads to most quests and the search for crafting materials to feel more like chores, than fun. At only 8 hours into the game, I found myself overwhelmingly bored. And it's a shame.  (IF YOU DID NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)
2834	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is something of a mixed bag. The combat system is fluid and fun, and Amalur itself can be gorgeous looking (with a little post-processing such as SweetFX). Unfortunately, the story, characters, and crafting mechanic is somewhat generic. I found myself losing steam two thirds of the way through the main quest. I am glad I finished the game, but I donâ€™t see any compelling reason to return to finish the side quests.
2835	0	a	This is a really tough one. I so want to love this game. It's huge, with ton's of quests, tons of loot, tons of places to explore, looks good, sounds good... but it just feels so average and generic.  The outdoor areas look very much alike with just varying amounts of grass and trees, the exceptions are few. The caves, tombs and dungeons get old very quickly. Even though you get a fast travel system I have often felt like I wanted a horse. The side quests are simple and mostly boring. The world doesn't react to you at all, you don't ever change it or affect it, which is really sad for a single-player game, it often feels like an MMORPG in this regard.  I kinda hoped for a Gothic game with a better combat and maybe in raw technical sense I got one, but it never managed to grab me and make me want to play it and I've given it an ample amount of chances. It just completely failed to make me 'care' about anything at all. The world, the story, the people, my own character... I don't know why. I really want to like it, it's not exactly lacking anything major that I'd want from it, but what it delivers just doesn't feel exciting and/or fun.
2836	0	a	Average - with both good and poor features, showing a lack of cohesion in design. Incredibly simple Combat, Horrendous choices that do nothing in the profession system, superb voice acting completly at odds with the character appearances, laughable npc animations and a maguffin story that can be said in 4 words. This game 'boasts' 200 hours of gameplay but doing any % of sidequests means you'll one shot most enimies on the hardest difficulty. The Main Quest is about 15-20 hours. I think considering the amount of enemy types (9) it's still strecthing it a bit long. The redeeming features are phenominal music, lovely backdrops and varied sidequests. If you like Tolkien-esque fantasy in a Fable clone, pick it up - if it's on sale.
2837	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is essentially an MMO without the multiplayer. Leaving you stuck with lackluster NPCs, fetch/kill quests, and a world that just seems... empty. The upside? Incredible combat, additionally marred by a camera that doesn't really know what it wants to do.
2838	0	a	I've tried several times to get into this game but it just isn't happening.  Pros: Looks gorgeous. Runs smoothly at (or close to) 60 FPS. Colorful, imaginative designs. You can reroll your character on the fly and try out multiple builds on one character. Combat is simple, but not awful. Reminds me of a combination of the good parts of Fable and an Elder Scrolls game. Lots of side quests and dialog options (if you want that). Fast travel AND a decent run speed make exploring not a chore.  Cons: Story is incredibly bland. Yet another 'chosen one with no memories please save the world' snooze-fest. Every quest is a fetch quest or a 'go here and activate 4 different towers and come back, thanks' deal. Random battles, as in enemies will just appear out of nowhere and attack you. That last one would be bad, but there are a lot of enemies that can fly and cast magic, so they spend most of the time hovering just outside your attack range spaming magic blasts. The menus are a slog to get through. Lore books everywhere filled with really boring, needless notes. Some of the worst fantasy names this side of Dungeon Siege 3.  If you can grab the complete edition for ~$5 and you really, really want to play another Elder Scrolls inspired game it's not a bad deal, but be warned that it is aggressivly dull underneath the pretty paintjob.
2839	0	a	TL;DR: It's an alright game if you're just looking for something to scratch a third-person action itch for twenty hours or so, but there's really nothing that makes it stand out as anything special.  Combat itself is entertaining enough, but there's absolutely no depth to it - you have one basic attack per weapon type that can be chained together to a limited extent, and a couple of active abilities that scale so terribly you'll hardly bother using them. And since unlocking additional weapon moves is locked in to progress down the ability trees, you spend half the game without access to the more varied attacks, meaning that most of the time you'll just be hitting your attack button and blocking/dodging occasionally.  The combat balance is almost non-existent, enemies are almost universally completely trivial other than the occasional one who is an annoying damage sponge and does hilariously disproportionate damage, and there's only about a dozen different enemies who are palette swapped and recycled throughout the course of the game. The most challenging part of the combat is dealing with the abysmal camera, which has a mind of its own and loves to zoom right in on you when you're surrounded by enemies, only stopping to clip through the scenery and get stuck under the floor occasionally.  There's a variety of non-combat skills to choose from (lockpicking, stealth, persuasion and so on) which are generally either absolutely bloody useless, or hilariously overpowered. Depending on which ones you choose you can end up completely trivialising the game without even trying, but with a little care you can max out almost all of the skills anyway which makes any sense of choice completely redundant.  The ability trees are probably the highlight of the game, there's a lot of different abilities to choose from, and thankfully you can respec your character at any time to try different things out. Depending on how you want to play, you can either go deep into one of the trees (magic, might, or finesse, which broadly correspond to the standard mage/warrior/rogue archetypes) or split your points across two or even all three trees. Putting enough points into one tree or a combination of trees unlocks 'destinies' which give you added stats and bonus abilities and can make different ability builds feel very different from each other. Ultimately, however, it's still limited by the shallow nature of the combat system, and however you build your character you'll inevitably end up spamming the same basic attacks over and over again.  The real issue is with the pacing of the game. Every single town you come across is chock full of completely forgettable NPCs who will bury you up to your eyeballs in fetch quests and kill quests which give no real rewards but make you slog all over the place anyway. Either you try and do everything out of an obsessive sense of completionism, or you get bored of that by the second or third town, rush through the main quests, and realise there's really not that much game under all that padding. There are half a dozen factions with their own sidequest chains that have a bit more structure to them, but none of them really add much to the game, and aside from some minor stat boosts it makes absolutely no difference to anything whether you do them or not.  Overall it's a thoroughly mediocre experience through and through, which never manages to be amazingly good or offensively bad. If you like third-person action RPG games it ticks pretty much all of the boxes, it does everything more or less adequately without ever really impressing, it all looks nice enough and there's a whole bunch of lore if you can be bothered to pay attention to it. Pick it up in a sale and it'll give you a good thirty hours or so of moderate entertainment, but it's a mostly unremarkable experience with next to no replay value.
2840	0	a	I wanted to love it, I really did but it's just so boring. It's not all bad though the game is very pretty and ran very well on my machine. The combat is good, there's better combat out there it's not compelling enough to be entertaining more than a few hours. This is where the bad starts to come in. The plot was very bland and unremarkable for such a well crafted world they should have had a much more compelling plot but they didn't manage to make me care in 7 or so hours and at that point I am never going to care. The never ending fetch quests got boring very quickly, it helps move you along to new locations but it all starts to feel stale after awhile. I feel like there is some promise here and maybe when the franchise is sold to another company they can pare away all of the unnecessary nonsense, but for now there are better rpg experiences out there that you should consider way before this one. Overall I would not recommend this.  Rating: 2/5 Stars
2841	0	a	Essentially a single-player RPG with the contents of a MMO-rpg (expect the social aspect)  Some of the games artwork can at times be appealing, but personally I prefer a somewhat more toned down and realistic style. In this game, the characters have overly sized hands and weapons etc all showered with all the brightest colours the designers could think of.  The game consist of a few faction quest lines, which at times can be interesting, but all too often quest are 'go to certain point, fetch/kill, and return). Real choicemaking is non-existent.  The main story line is bland and generic, even with the '10 000 years' of background history the develpoers brag about. Magic elves, technical dwarfes, in-between humans... . The lack of good voiceacting only contributes to the game's inability to immerse, with probably as few as 10 voice-actors trying to the best of their ability to voice all characters in the game.  The combat-system is quite nice. Quite easy, but a lot of ways for the player to adapt underway to the way they want to play. And unlike more classic RPGs all character developments can be changed for a small fee, so that the player don't have to think ahead. Nice, for some... . Almost all ingame quest-rewards and looting is scaled it seems, so the player seldom experience any sense of joy or positive surprise when overcoming obstacles. Many enemies are scaled too it seems.  Personally I had to stop playing this game after encountering a game-breaking bug (Her righteous fury-quest), of which there is no official fix to 4 years after release (due to the developers bankruptcy, I guess). Therefore I could not fully explore the main idea of this game - fate. I find the idea of fate troubling on a logical level, and the game as far as I played it, did only contribute to this with all its logical fallacies.  Nice enough game if you are looking for mind-numbing, button-mashing action-rpg, with little need for investment on the player's part. Stay clear (even on sale), if you are looking for immersion, challenge and a sense of accomplishment.   This game will suck the marrow out of your bones if you are a true RPG fan. 5/10
2842	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur begins with an appealing, even charming veneer that quickly and dramatically tarnishes. At its best, it's a generic, 'safe' fantasy game more reminisicent of an MMO than a single player WRPG.  -------------------------------------------  Combat is broken down into the typical RPG trio of Warrior (Might), Rogue (Finesses), and Mage (Sorcery), or a Jack of All Trades, with the option to respec whenever you want, as often as you want. From the beginning to the end, Sorcery goes from significantly stronger to hilariously overpowered, and the classes ultimately play the same, the only difference being in what particle effects you throw at the enemy.  The game plays more like an MMO than a traditional single player RPG. You drift from zone to zone, awaiting the inevitable explosion of yellow exclamation points, and there are indeed many. Too many, as a matter of fact. While one can argue that this adds more gampeplay time, it's more padding than lengthening. There's no substance to any of them, and they all play out essentially the same. A random loot system adds another serious deficit. Fighting your way to the bottom of an ancient ruin, behind a hidden door you may find a few mushrooms and a healing potion, while looting a random household rewards you with the ancient Deathaxe of MurderLord. It's worth noting that this randomization applies to the Blacksmithing system too, in which you salvage items for parts (Which are also completely randomzied. Epic weapons are as likely to give you worthless parts as junk weapons)to craft new ones. In theory you should be able to create weapons better than what you'd find, but you'll more likely than not find trash parts, and anything you do craft will be beaten by something you find on the side of the road.  There's little to say about the system itself. It's a very simple click-based, skill-hotbar system of combat. It's not functionally bad, it's just not very interesting, and lacks any sort of depth. The game's Inventory system has to be one of the worst i've ever seen. Although there are attempts to provide organization, they are token. You are unable to sort your list-based inventory, which seems to organize itself completely at random. Items sharing the same set name may be dozens of slots away from each other. Also of note is a serious problem with many, many quest items that never lose their flagging, leaving them trapped in your inventory for the entire game. As they still take up space, this can be a serious issue. By the end of the game, over 50 of the 110 items in my inventory were quest flagged and unremoveable.   In terms of art and sound direction, again they hit every switch to be as generic and forgettable as possible, cycling through the usual array of fantasy zones and unenergetic voice acting. The game is rife with bugs and glitches, some of which can be gamebreaking, and many of which will impact your gaming experience in other ways, such as the above mentioned Inventory issue.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- If I had to sum up Amalur in 5 words, I'd only need to give you two. 'Generic. Pass.'
2843	0	a	Lackluster. They borked their camera and prevent you from seeing a lot of the hard work they put into the visual design.   The story is freaking hoaky. Nothing interesting. The whole fate thing has been done to death by the Japanese, come on man.  The gameplay is a mixed bag, the quests suck. They're MMO quests in a single player RPG, not cool. The combat how ever is alright, though given how big the environments are they could have gone a lot more nuts with it, buy what ever. Combat gets an A.  I can't recommend this game for anything other than a quick sale buy. I really hope someone takes the ideas from it and makes something presentable.
2844	0	a	Have you ever played an MMORPG and felt, 'oh gosh, I wish there was no once else but me and the NPC's around here'? Then this game is right up your alley. This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.  Positive: + Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy + The armor is the game looks good + Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at + If you dig deep there's can be some fun character builds  Negative: - Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful - The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use - Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest. - Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game. - They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it. - I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests. - Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.  With all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.  Only buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.
2845	0	a	It's a good game. Anyways you will be killing the same damned monsters from the beginning of the game to the end of the game, it's absolutely ridicoulous, there are like 6/7 types of monsters so let's repeat the killing again and again and again.  The good part is the character evolution. You can upgrade your champion in many different ways...  A good game for 6$ but it would have a lot of potential with other monster types
2846	0	a	Try this game if you really like action RPGs, but if you're looking for a good, solid sandbox adventure, keep on walking.  The game world is huge, and I mean HUGE, but a ton of it is padding, and with the limited mobility options you're given, it gets really really tedious carting your sorry carcass all over creation to get things done. After a certain point it becomes a series of well-choreographed and engaging battles held together by drudgery and vast amounts of running, and that's even with fast travel as a possibility.  This game was originally envisioned as an MMO, and it really shows. You can't jump on your own, you can't really wander off the beaten path (largely because every path is so thoroughly beaten already) and without a horse or some form of mount you're left to running or sprinting. Calling this game a 'wide-open adventure' is kind of like calling a hike through redwoods with the inability to look up a 'wide-open adventure;' all of the things are there, but you can't really utilize them to their fullest capacity.  At the end of the day, KOA:R feels exactly like what it is: a U-turn into marketability.
2847	0	a	A decent game, but everything gets repetitive and bland after a while. All the quest mostly meet npc, long run to dungeon, kill kill kill, long run back, get crappy reward. Even with the fast travel its still a lot of running to be done.  World map view is separated to two different view, one overall view and one more detail view. You have to go to the overall view to fast travel, which is really annoying since you need to swap between those two and the overall view is pretty much useless.  This game would be a great for multiplay/online coop game with their huge world, running alone in the bloody huge world is really tiring.  In summary, loads of content, but most of it are the same. Rather then making the world huge they should've concretrate on the quality of the content.
2848	0	a	Fun and dynamic combat-system with cringeworthy writing and uninviting corridoor maps tacked on in an attempt to create an RPG. The combat alone was engaging enough to play past the point where I started to hate the writing and claustrophobia was creeping in, but in the end I gave up hope that things would change and skill and gear progression made the fights too easy. A real let-down, this game, but I give it points for effort in the combat department. [4/10]
2849	0	a	Alright, well, here we go, I bought this game under the impression it was open world, and had RPG elements, which it did have on both accounts, HOWEVER, After playing for 20 hours I came to a realization, this game is monotonous, it feels like ive been doing the same side quest 50 TIMES, the main story itself was intriguing, and combat is fairly fluid and dynamic, the class system in this game is different to say the least. To summarize, I came away from this game the same way I came away from Skyrim, its alot of fun, until you do everything, the choices you make have no real consequence, and the world seems HUGE on the map, but the reality is, its just large open (or semi-closed) spaces with the same brands of monsters scattered throughout the world at large, there is a backstory, but your so caught up in everything, you dont see it, I recomend this game when its onsale (for like 10$) but otherwise 7/10
2850	0	a	The game is actually pretty great and I would love to recommend it but it also managed to provide me with some of the most frustrating gaming experiences I've ever had, enough for me to just uninstall it after 30 hours of play time. There are several bugs in the game that there are no fixes for and which get you stuck, permanently. So if you didn't make a separate save (not auto-save) then you basically have to start over. The first time it happened I had a save from like 10 hours previous, very frustrating but I kept playing. Then it happened again on another quest. It just blows my mind that the developers don't even acknowledge it, let alone try to issue a patch for it.
2851	0	a	Lots of options for fighting and item crafting, but the world is way too generic and cookie cutter. Quests are boring and lack excitement. Proceed with caution.
2852	0	a	For 20 hours, I wanted to like this and tried as well. Eventually it became too hard to do so. The world is interesting, but there is too much lore and not enough drama and characterization. The choice of graphical style was very poor and is a complete mismatch to the fairly serious tone. Combat system, skill trees and many other things work well enough, but all collapses in face of the difficulty, or lack of it. It is simply impossible to fail in Amalur, and extremely hard to fall in combat. Crafting is so overpowered that loot becomes inessential and it is easy to kill everything with single clicks. Amalur is not moddable either. There is a difficulty mod, but it actually requires CheatEngine to use!
2853	0	a	I really wish Steam had a 'maybe' recommendation, because this game fits into that. I usually give RPGs about 10 hours to get me hooked, and I gave this one 20 because I heard the story was great and compelling but the story didn't go anywhere during the 20 hours I played. If I hear 'you have to put 40 in to like it' then I say go play an MMO if you're into that.  Overall, the combat is fun. I really liked it, but that might be because you never actually get to use it. You get some new gear and upgrade a few skill points and you're 1-hitting anything your level. Bosses are challenging, until you go into the superpower mode and kill each and every one. Quests aren't very compelling and the talking goes on forever without much reason for me to care about anybody. Not only that but one of the DLC's storylines about giants, which I was interested in, had a glitch that prevented me from finishing it without restarting completely. Awesome.  The graphics are cool and you know what, I wish this game had multiplayer. If it had 2 or even 4 player co-op, it would be awesome. I would have so much fun playing with other people, but the lack of enemies to kill, lack of cares I give, and lack of anything interesting in almost a day playing makes it where I don't feel happy recommending this game.
2854	0	a	It's not bad, but the constant running back and forth to quest hubs feels like a single player MMO from the early WoW clones days (Runes of Magic, etc), especially with these graphics.  Entertaining at first, but gets old fast. Love the character progression, but not enough to keep playing.
2855	0	a	I was really looking forward to this game, but in retrospect I probably shouldn't have bothered playing it. This game wastes your time with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sidequests at any given opportunity (and a boring main quest). However, the scenery is very nice in places and they did at least TRY to make interesting combat, but it becomes very repetitive after the first quarter.  It's definitely not the worst game I've played, and I can understand people enjoying it as a mindless time-killer, but I cannot recommend it.
2856	0	a	I spent hours playing this game, hoping at some point that it would get better. Sadly it did not.  The action in the game is quite good, one as to be on their toes when fighting multiple monters/enemies. But sadly it gets repetitive.  The monsters that you encounter in beginning will be the same ones that you encounter at the very end. All they do is call them different things. Example: 'Weak boggart in the beginning versus Strong Boggart' in the end.   The characters are forgettable, some of them really even have no business being in the plot.   The quests are fun at first but then they just devolve into 'go here, kill 5 wolves, come back'   The plot is interesting and seemingly original at first but by half way into the story it just turns into total garbage. The main antagonist isn't even that interesting. His dialogue is terrible, one dimensional, and repetitive. The voice acting of him is done by what sounds like a sick old man.  And everyone talks to you as if you have NO POWER at all, despite the constant acts you carry out that continually prove that you have god like powers.  I literally killed a demon the size of a 6 story building in one part of the story, only for the antagonist to talk to me afterwards as if I was some weak puppy that had the strength of an ant. Even one of your friends in the story acts like she could beat you down any time she wants, even though you constantly kick 500 times more butt than she ever could.  The endgame is no fun, not even a challenge. Once you get past a certain level and can make your own gear, you pretty much sleep walk through the late stages of the game.  I did my first playthrough of this game on HARD and I killed the final boss in 4 hits... yes you read that right, 4 hits. The difficulty on this game is a total joke.  I would only recommend this game for kids, if you are a seasoned RPG or action game players, this will be a serious let down.
2857	0	a	This isn't a bad game, its just not worth your time.  The best way to describe it is like an awsome MMO from the mid 2000's with nobody on the servers.  The main story is good, but there are SO MANY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t fetch quests that just eat up time and you have to do some of them to be an appropriate level to beat the game. There almost all terrible.  The ONLY way I could reccomend this game is if you are an unemployed gamer (no judgment) and want a large amount of time for you buck and don't mind sacrificing gameplay.  If you have a good internet connection I reccomend any good MMO over this game. It will scratch the same itch but better.
2858	0	a	the most MMO-like single player ever. Grindy and with an irritating known but unpatched but that means you stop getting correctly levelled loot far enough into the game to make restarting painful.

2860	0	a	The camera is the most frustrating aspect I've ever had to deal with. Anytime I move, it pans to the ground, and won't move up, or suddenly it will move straight up. I tried, inverting it, lowering the sensitivity, nothing works.
2861	0	a	Although I've played through pretty well the whole game (minus a little bit of DLC) I can't recommend this game.   While others say that all the side quests are great and add value to the game, all they were for me was make busy time to make the game feel long. For example, towards the middle/end of the game there is a gnome city where to get the side quest you go to the very back corner of a house and then to finish the fetch quest you have to go the very back of another house and then of course go back to the quest giver to finish the quest. There doesn't appear to be any sort of design choice for that other than making the quest take longer. The amount of side quests also showed just how forgetable the main story quest was. I don't recall much if any of the main quest because there would sometimes be hours and hours between times you did something related to the main story quest.  As 'big' as this game is. It feels empty. Almost every area you go to is super similar. You go to a new area, there will be one town or a larger city to get quests from, then there is a bunch of caves/tombs/ruins to fulfil those quests. A lot of those caves/tombs/ruins all feel the same because you do the same thing in each. You enter the side quest area at one end, go to the end of the area, finish your quest and then a new path opens up to send you back to the beginning. As well each of these areas feel like copies of each other with different colour pallets. Half of these areas could have been removed and more time/focus spent on bigger and better side quests that actually felt rewarding.  As well there is a serious problem with enemies in this game, as in, there is not near enough of them. There appears to be a set of them and then a bunch of recolours or with a different weapon or something. There was hardly an variety in the enemies making each area again feel like copies of previous areas.  The one positive I'm going to give this game is the amount of lore they've packed into it. If you complete all the side quests/faction quests and main quest you will have a lore overload and if thas your thing this game has it.
2862	0	a	Only spent an hour playing this game because I encountered a game-breaking bug. About an hour in, you fight the first 'boss', the rock troll. After defeating the troll, you are prompted to press F. I spent almost half an hour spamming F in every area around the troll. I tried restarting the game. Tried restarting my computer. I tried using a controller. I tried killing the troll in the center of the room, per suggestions online. Nothing. I am unable to progress because I'm unable to finish this sequence.   Almost 5 years later and this game-breaking bug isn't fixed. Oh well, I guess it was only $5.
2863	0	a	Boring game. Little weapon variety, what weapons there are all have the same attacks, just press one attack button. Same monsters throughout the entire game, they just give them different names. Main quest line is very boring and repetitive. Go into this castle and fight horde after horde of people to kill this boss, all while just pressing one button to attack *yawn*. Feels like an MMO but it is single player so the whole world feels very empty and lonely and not fun to explore. If you go the rogue class good luck getting any gear. 14 hours of gameplay and i still had the starting gear they gave me in the tutorial because everything else was for casters or warriors. Dont waste your money, even if its on sale
2864	0	a	Story drags from one repetative quest to another. The real time combat system and gear system is wierd. For instance a stealther with a shield? Even a decent way into the game I find myself spamming the same attack combo over and over.  EA also gives you buffed gear in the beginning, one set is themed after Sheapard from Mass Effect. IT is seriously overpowered, and will make you for a good part of the beginning of the game wonder why the game drops gear at all.  I really want to like this game have tried it several times to try to get into it, but just cannot. It has great graphics and the main story is interesting, that is about where it ends.  Lastly can we say EA account... why even allow the game on Steam if I have to have an EA Origin account to play?
2865	0	a	Amalur would have been a great...well, at least good, 20-30 hour game. Unfortunately it goes on far, far, far longer than it should have The mechanics are already well worn by hour 15 and did little to change over the next 40. This wouldn't be too bad if the game wasn't excessively repetitive, even by RPG standards. You spend the bulk of this time mashing buttons to kill groups of 4-8 enemies over and over - never with any sense of real power or progression due to enemies leveling with you. Quests become a homogenous blur of cave delving and monster killing and about 2/3 of the way through the game I began to resent it and just rushed through to see the ending. I wish I had made the decision to do that even sooner.  It's a shame because it seems like the world has actually has a reasonably novel backstory. It relies on typical fantasy tropes, but not quite to the extent of other RPGs. The story also opens an interesting manner; however, even this falls short of it's potential, with a stodgy presentation that lacks personality and the game's overabundance of sidequests, fights, and travel diluting whatever motivating force the story could impart. At some point you stop caring and stop listening and characters are just a means to check off quest objectives.

2867	0	a	Can not get this game to run. Forums are no help. Want a refund. No game should take this much of my time to fix.
2868	0	a	After everal hundred hours of play, the movements of the character stalls, hesitates and locks up. I have removed this game and reloaded it without any improvement. I have reloaded flash player and shockave, no help. The other steam games I use still work properly, therefor the problelm seems to be intigral to this probram. HELP??
2869	0	a	The combat is okay, but magic is straight up better than the rest of the trees (which are broken up by your standard warrior/thief/wizard) and while there is a 'lot of content' most of the side missions are repetative and boring. The people who give those quests are almost real people, but I feel like while there was all this time put into the world could have gone into more of the gameplay itself.  I can not recomend this for the current $20 price tag, and I wouldn't recomend it at a lower price tag. I would say there are probably better options out there, especially if you don't want to use a controller or are not a fan of bad camera.
2870	0	a	Sandbox games fail when they are simply padded with tedious, meaningless side quests whose only purpose is to string out your gameplay time. Enter Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, which embodies the worst of this.   The principle concept of the main story is actually pretty interesting. Everyone is tied to fate except you. So you have the potential to change the course of history. Its a pretty good excuse for a chosen one scenario. This ties into a card mechanic that shows up when you level and accomplish certain milestones. It also gives a good excuse for how you can re-shuffle your stats. Then everything goes downhill.   There's still bugs, particularly when you try to remap your keys and a few crash to desktops, but that isn't the games greatest sin. Neither is the hideous menu system (which in turn makes crafting annoying at best). The worst part? In short, the game just becomes so boring. It became boring surprisingly early. It is a chore just to want to finish it. This is a direct result of the heavy investment in sidequests and how travel works. I've spent the majority of my 40+ hours just running from place to place for quests. Running from place to place is boring. Running in a linear dungeon with the same tedious fights that are always resolved in the same manner because of a lack of needed for any real tactics and a surprising lack in variety of gameplay is also very boring.   That word best summarizes Kingdoms of Amalur: Boring.
2871	0	a	Well, this one is quite a hard one for me.   For starters, it was a blast, like discovering a jewel that has been sitting in front of you all of the time without you noticing it. I was like, 'Why didn't I know this game did exist at all?' And so I was really hooked to it for a couple of hours. A couple of dozens of hours.   A really pretty game. Big and stable (at least for me). WIth a funny and fluent combat system (I would dare to say in the likes of Dark Souls, Darksiders or Blade: Edge of Darkness (things tend to get dark when combat systems are cool, it seems)). With a slightly original setting from your usual fantasy RPG and inmersive too. Decent crafting, voice acting and music...  But then it started to feel a bit shallow. As if you were playing an MMOPRG, but without the social interaction. Quests started to feel repetitive, the NPCs less charming, the story not that interesting. Everything was a bit of a chore.   Worst of all, I felt no challenge at all. Even when the combat felt right and was funny, this has to be the ONE game for me in which I NEVER died. Not once. In the whole of the game. Not a single failed combat situation, and let me tell you it is a long way to complete it. I know there are roundabouts for this (both patches and even set paths to keep you a wimp for the whole of the main story around the web), but this is clearly not right.  So, at the end, I wouldn't recommend it. It gave me plenty of hours of enjoyemet a the star, but left me empty and a bit angry by the mid-end game. If you can get it on sale (not very often, I think) go for it, but else, I wouldn't do so.  Cheers,
2872	0	a	Game is fun but has too many issues and too many filler content. If you really want it, rush it on casual and buy it when it is on sale.
2873	0	a	-Did not keep my attention for long -World feels enclosed/empty and superficial (like playing in a giant bowl) -Combat-oriented; inappropriate/out of place hack-n-slash combat system for an RPG  -Felt reminiscent to a mediocre MMORPG without all the players (shallow quests, for instance)  +appealing visuals and aesthetics  +despite combat system feeling out of place, it is rather satisfying +skill trees presented cool abilities and freedom of playstyle; you do not have to spend points on a single tree to benefit  Final Verdict: I want my $5 back.
2874	0	a	At first the game seemed to be fun. It was fun trying out different builds, character looks, weapons and magic. The quests were fun as well, in the beginning that is. But the fun pretty much stopped when I realised that the quest are all the same 'we have a problem, please do that and that' - so tedious and unimaginitive and boring. I mean the quest in Skyrim are so much better and IMMERSIVE. So combat system becomes a drag and a total bore after you get to Ysa (that how it was for me) and the difficulty is disheartening. I played on hard, yet it was a stroll. Boring. Don't mean to spoil the ending, but it was so ******* stupid and dull. The whole game feels so scripted you can't feel yourself immersed in the world of Amalur.  3/10
2875	0	a	I encountered just few minor bugs in this game, but what was more annyoing, was camera. Very weird, I just couldnt get used to it and didnt find any means how to change it. Moreover, this game is quite similar to Bethesdas Elder scrolls series, so why to bother playing Amalur, if Daggerfall, Morrowind and so on are just amazing enough.
2876	0	a	This game is overly long with way too many areas and quests for such a non-epic storyline. The art style just didn't seem to mesh with a narrative written by R. A. Salvatore. Combat was repetitive and boring as well with boss fights that weren't memorable...seriously, I can't describe a single boss sequence from this game, and I played it from start to finish and completed all quests in each area (I really shouldn't have wasted my time on that). Yeah, this game does a great job to suck you in, but it's about as addictive as World of Warcraft but without the payoff.
2877	0	a	It's not that it's outright bad, but I just don't like it. Every time I tried to give this game another shot, something held me back. Whether it was the plain jane beat 'em up combat, or the odd camera angles (which make it harder to appreciate the beautiful environment of the game) there's just something that stopped me from enjoying this game.
2878	0	a	This game most definatley has its merits, but in the end it feels like a cheap singleplayer MMO. The combat system is unique and spectacular, and the world is most definatley large, but a lot of the times, it feels empty and lifeless. Most of the quests are generic go here, gather that quests and that's fine if you are into that kind of thing, but it gets old quickly. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoningâ„¢ means well, but it loses momentum fast.
2879	0	a	Game with no aesthetic quality, and bland combat. Meh overall.
2880	0	a	If you're looking for a game that constantly makes you think, 'hey, this would be cool, if...' then this is the game for you. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a game that would have been great, if they had only done a little more/better... of, well, everything. Am not trying to imply that It is a bad game, just disappointing, since with a little more effort and time, it could have been something worthwhile. However, it is what it is, which is an mediocre action adventure game with semi open world rpg elements that is only worth it if you can get it on sale and have a lot of free time.
2881	0	a	I wouldnâ€™t buy this game for 40 euro, because the gameplay not worth that much. It's worth your money if you buy it between 5-10 euro.   +++ Some areas are very beatiful drawn  - - Some areas drawn rush trough  +- The MAIN story is reasonable  +- The FACTIONS storyâ€™s are reasonable  - The OTHER story's are very boring - Boring conversations  - Bad graphics (cartoony like WoW) - Very bad music  - Quest log is bugged; you canâ€™t read the questlog - The game has very simple mechanics (childish) just rush trough. Good for noobs.  - The combatsystem is very easy in Normal mode. Good for starters boring for hardcore players.  - The game feels childish not like Skyrim or Dark Souls   Overall score: 72%
2882	0	a	Loot system isn't great. Lacks environment diversity, and many mechanics present in other examples of this genre, such as locking on enemies, which is very annoying. The game becomes boring very fast.
2883	0	a	Simple and boring. Only fun the first playtrough. 5/10
2884	0	a	its sad to say that i had this working fine back in the day in a hacked version.... now i actually go and be a good kid and pay for it... doesnt work... lost cause. 3 days 5 different installs and every combination of forum suggestions... lost cause.. will not launch past black screen where i have to force close 
2885	0	a	Nothing about this game drew me into it, the plot was meh, the gameplay was alright and the storytelling was just fine. I went into it expecting something like Fable and was greatly dissapointed. 5/10
2886	0	a	This game itself seem'ed interesting enough. I've got it during the sale, it was a 'great' deal...At first.  See, I haven't got far into the game, and have hit a glitch / bug that apparent, is very common. This bug, is that your character would move for about 3 seconds, than stuck in the same spot indefinitely, until another action is performed. This isn't lag, the game world around you runs just fine. ( The solution to this bug, is to reload a save file before this bug occured. ) But this bug happened to me just very shortly after I've started the tutorial...  According to Google, and several websites. This game's developer studio crashed and burned shortly after this game's release, so there will be no post-release patches or updates to fix any bugs or glitched that could / may occur in the game.  The game concept itself seems interesting enough, where you could build your own character, and play any style you want. But as I've stated above, this glitch threw me off way too much. I've lost complete interest after about 30 minutes of game time.  If you think you've got pretty good luck, and insists on trying this game out. Go for it, for its sale price, it's pretty decent. It's just a pity that this game breaking bug will never be fixed. Really seem'ed like a fun game.
2887	0	a	A pretty boring Quest Fest.
2888	0	a	Very basic game. Simple hack'n slash. Graphics reasonable, limited amount of enemies. Story is extremely generic, bland and forgettable, same as all characters. World is empty, lore is boring/non-existant. Skills are mediocre. Just about all quests are fetch, go and kill, with a lot of walking/backtracking. Even instant travel to found locations doesn't make life that much better. Some minor bugs, DLC is nothing special. Really not worth it at all.
2889	0	a	if you like games with combat based entirely on stunlocks, kingdoms of amalur is for you
2890	0	a	This game is almost good. I really wanted to enjoy it, but it's ruined by the fact that it's WAY too easy. Even on the hardest difficulty, there is no real point in doing... anything. You can do perfectly well with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ character and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ weapons. A main point of a game like this should be progression and developing your character, but there's no point in doing so because you can stomp pretty much anything in the game with ease.
2891	0	a	I have to say, I really wanted to like this game. I was under the impression that Reckoning was a 'sleeper' of sorts, even though I'm not a big fan of stylized graphics. While I started out feeling somewhat good about the game, it didn't take long to notice the lack of palpable, gut-sticking depth. When it came time to sit down and pick my poison for the night I had no desire to play this game.  Pros: Fun combat controls, excellent environs, plenty to do, quite a number of crafting options, solid animations, mostly polished, mix-matching of the 3 class types (warrior, rogue, wizard).  Cons: The stories/adventures/crafting lack a special something (heart?), no jumping/climbing, beautiful areas are often just for 'looks' and cannot be explored, small areas where the game just wasn't fleshed out (like reading books, managing inventory, and skill trees).  If you're looking for a light romp though a fantasy world and you're less concerned about depth and more interested in a relatively fun combat system and plenty of run-around, this is likely a good enough choice for you. If you're on the other side of the fence and you prefer options, a little more freedom, and a world to sink your teeth into you'll not find it here.
2892	0	a	At first it was fun to slash and burn..but the story isn't captivating so I stopped the game at 12 hours...
2893	0	a	So close, so very close. This game was almost good. It had a lot of good ideas, but did not follow through with any of them. Everything in the game feels just short of being good. It is probably a case of trying to do too much. Rather than do a few things very well, this game tries to give you everything, and none of it quite makes the cut. The plot takes some interesting ideas, but does not develop them very well. The setting starts of interesting looking, but is not fully realised. The combat system could have been the best, but the mechanics just do not quite work properly. The Quests try to do something a little different, but they still manage to feel stale very quickly. This was almost a really good RPG, but instead it feels thoroughly disappointing.
2894	0	a	woke up in a pile of dead bodies, could not sleep with any of them 8/10 game f**king sucks ~ign
2895	0	a	Didnt like it: Played through the tutorial &amp; was bored. Combat systems are boring from what I've seen. Felt like the bad parts of an MMO right off the bat.
2896	0	a	I tried to like this game. A HUGE open world with endless amount of things to do. Unfortunately, too much running around and somehow a way too boring. I installed hardcoremod (which made game much better), but unfortunately even that couldn't help me to overcome the strong feeling of boredom. Fighting is dull (and too easy), discussions and characters are boring, the world is beatiful but still nothing new. This game just has no soul. Better luck next time.
2897	0	a	The graphics are kind of cartoony which makes them look out of date. The quests get repetitive really fast (kill this, fetch that). The skill trees are OK, but they have been done in similar ways sooo many times. The cutscenes are poor because the characters just stand there. And sometimes background sounds interfere with the cutscenes - e.g. a wounded woman was moaning like she was in a porno so loud at the first cutscene that I was barely able to hear what was being said. I mean come on, if you can't patch such simple things, then forget it. It really does not help with the story that is bland anyway. To sum up - as many reviewers here mentioned before, this game is just so mediocre and uninspiring in every way. It's like a boring offline MMO. Nothing stands out, everything has been done before here or there and many times in a better way. I really tried to like this game but I just got so bored so fast.
2898	0	a	Lackluster and boring
2899	0	a	go buy fable instead.
2900	0	a	This game could be really good &amp; fun to play but unfortunate there is so many bugs in this game that it's simply not possible to complete all missions in the game (without getting hugs bugs there affects your game)  110 hours have i now played and restarted about 10 times! and this is serious too much for me so i cannot recommend this game at all.
2901	0	a	Graphics: ok Gameplay: to slow for Hack &amp; Slay Camera: extrem poor :( Inventar and Menue: poor Interface: ok Cinematic: to many and poor Spelling: ok  Quality: poor 
2902	0	a	Originally developed as an MMORPG, Kingdoms of Amalur is sort of like playing a great online game on your own little private server.   The advantage of this is that you don't have to play the game with any MMORPG weirdos. So if RPGs are your go-to for immersion, nobody's going to mess with your little fantasy here.  The disadvantage is that, weird as other players can be, it's actually very depressing playing a game like this on your own, and it can feel a lot like you're marooned in some sort of MMORPG-version solipsistic nightmare with all NPC eyes on you. This is the sad secret behind every single player game, but developers usually go to great lengths to hide it.   In this game you will feel alone because in playing it, you are alone. You will travel and discover (frequently beautiful) new lands, defeat big monsters, talk to boring NPCs, and collect silly looking gear. You will do it alone, and you will feel alone. The world is open and everything is permitted because there's nobody around to care about you or your choices. Your victories will feel as hollow as your losses because ultimately they are.  Stripped of narrative weight and consequence to accomodate the MMO format, stripped of human consequence because 38 Studios died and we needed a single player game instead, Kingdoms of Amalur is a great 'could have been' that bears the burden of both single player loneliness and MMO repetition. A theme park that everybody either left, or nobody ever made it to. Truly depressing.
2903	0	a	It would be a good game if it weren't for the Main Story Bugs In the 'hunters hunted' mission (a main Quest mission) there is a bug that prevents you from proceeding with the main quest and there is nothing you can do about it  Sorry to say- don't buy unless you see some actual patching being done on this game i spent hours on this game only to find i need to restart for the CHANCE of passing this level 
2904	0	a	Spent a long time playing this game and I just keep coming back to the same issue: I almost like it. Almost.  Combat is fun, graphics work well but the story is completly unengaging. Fun combat and no story does not an RPG make. Sooner or later the shine wears off the combat and you're left with no real reason to complete the game. Shame really.
2905	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is what an MMO would be like without other players. Want to wander through cavernous environments rife with fetch quests? Do you enjoy immersion breaking question-marked quest givers? How about a bland story that tries very hard get you interested in 10,000 years of lore without providing an modern (within the game context) relevance? Those are the features of KOA that you'll encounter. The combat is interesting and refreshing for an action-RPG but that doesn't make a good game nor does it draw me in to the world. After 15 hours or so I found myself playing this game like Diablo, micro-managing stats and largely ignoring the talky parts. That would be fine if KOA didn't try so hard to convince you its story is worth knowing. This is a game built on the words of RA Salvatore, how it failed to tell a story is beyond me.   Pros: Frequently on sale, Combat Cons: Story, MMO-like mechanics without multiplayer, Abuse of the word RPG, Fetch Quests, Throw-away mobs.  
2906	0	a	this is a game that i withstood against buying for some time yet i wanted to give it a try cus I heard that one of my favourite author ''RA Salvatore'' took place in the game and here what i think: + ; cool, action-packed gameplay nice graphs open world, yet this may become problematic after a point... variety in monsters. - ; uninteresting story, plot no matter how hard you try, things are so dissatisfying. shallow after sometime you get bored. i dont find the game very addictive repetitive crafting system... 6/10 
2907	0	a	I didn't like it. Basically, you can't jump and there are no objects in the game world, just containers; it's that sort of game. Don't get me wrong, the textures, lighting, character design, voices, buildings, weapons and world are OK, maybe 10 years ago I'd be really impressed with this game. However it just doesn't cut it after Skyrim, it's not even better then Oblivion or Gothic 2. To me, it's just not 'open world' unless you can jump and look around the back of the cave for a few elusive coins.  Shame, because it looks like a nice world and it's obviously had a lot of thought put into it but the gameplay too generic, paint by numbers and boring. This is to RPG what Zelda is to AD&amp;D
2908	0	a	The combat is fun. Unfortunately: The world does not feel open enough for an open-world RPG, and the NPCs are not interesting enough for a story-directed RPG. I normally do all the side-quests in an RPG, and in this game there are just so many that they burnt me out. The overarching story is embarrassingly generic. About a third into the game, loot drops become useless; crafting, on the other hand, is overpowered. Feels too much like it was over-simplified for consoles. No support or updates to fix issues.
2909	0	a	Imagine you're playing a generic MMORPG, except it is offline.
2910	0	a	The following is just my own opinion.  I really like the art style and the colorful world. Reminds me of Fable.  I really hate the control and the lack of deep game mechanics.  I would say buy it when it is dirt cheap. Otherwise don't bother.
2911	0	a	There are positivies but i really dont recommend this game if you hate doing side quests : Killing spiders, finding eggs and plants across the map etc. They are so boring and breaking the main point of the game so bad.
2912	0	a	Lots of potential, and some of it is fun. The biggest issue I have with this game is the same thing that ruined dragon age inquisition for me, way to much fluff. There are things in the game designed to waste your time and make the game longer for the sake of it being longer and not designed to add to the game.
2913	0	a	Purchased this game after reading about who was involved in its creation. Left it in my library for a while and wasn't motivated to install or play it. I finally got around to it!  Firstly, the world is huge! There are many places to explore if you're into that. Secondly, there are a lot of quests to gather. So far I have not seen any consequences to the decisions your hero makes. The story doesn't seem to be too much about the hero, but those around the hero, which, in my opinion, caused me to disassociate with my toon. I didn't feel particularly important. I mostly felt like some lackey who needed to fetch this or go slay that.  The audio of the game bothered me a bit, particularly the character speech. In a lot of instances I could barely hear the NPCs speak and had to rely on subtitles to know what's going on. I looked for an adjustment that catered to headphones (if that was the problem) but found no such option in the menu. I understand that the sounds should be directional (ie the dialogue should sound softer when camera is turned away from the NPC), but this occurs in cutscenes as well and I found it annoying that I could not hear the voice actors.  The camera action in the game is also a bit wonky. In some situations the camera just...leaves you, as if you dropped it and you watch your toon run away. The sensitivity of camera movement, if you're using a mouse to look around, is way too sensitive. A light movement from the mouse could swing the camera really fast at odd angles. That sort of thing made combat a little frustrating for me, where one second I am charging at my target and the next I'm looking at the wrong direction.  All in all, it's a beautiful game with a LOT to do and has a deep customization factor for your hero, but those little problems I noted above just takes the immersion experience away from me. To be able to be immersed into the world and its lore is why I like RPGs in the first place.
2914	0	a	The evolution is too slow. It's sad because it could have made a good game. It looked promising.
2915	0	a	Enjoyed this game alot on the XBOX 360 enough to rebuy it for PC. I should have just saved my money for something else because all Ive had since installing Kingdoms of Amalur is pure grief. First it begins with music stutter, then frames begin stuttering within 30 seconds of launching the game...then it crashes my PC. I guess this is another game that doesnt like the quad core i7. I cant recommned against buying the game for Duo core users as it will probably work better for them. After trying numerous times to get this game to run, I have given up and thankfully, I only lost $4.99 instead of $20. Its too bad though, I really would had liked to experience this game on PC instead of 360
2916	0	a	Have you ever wanted to play World of Warcraft entirely on your own? Grinding constantly respawning hordes of mobs, doing all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ little filler quests and collecting 10 bear asses for hours at an end, while having nobody to group up with to break up the monotony? Well then, this is the game for you! Specifically for you and no-one else!  Everyone else - feel free to play Skyrim instead. A much better game in every possible respect.  p.s. The art-style of this game is very cool and colorful, but is almost completely destroyed by the camera, staring at the ground 90% of the time with no option to adjust it in any way.
2917	0	a	my quest log is stuck. i can't pull it up or progress with the game. it freezes when i pull it up from the escape key or when i press L
2918	0	a	I really wanted to like this game and while I enjoyed the first quarter of it, the game quickly became lackluster. There was so much potential staring me right in the face but the lack of polish and variety ultimately made for a rather boring experience. Numerous times through the game I couldn't help but think that the producers, having probably spent a large portion of the budget to bring in McFarlane for concept art; Salvatore for story writing; and voice actors for all of the dialog, were demanding unrealistic publish dates that forced the developers into a tough position. The world wasn't immersive enough, the combat encounters were way too repetative due to painfully small monster variety, the itemization was awful... during the last quarter of the game I stopped openning chests and looting bodies completely because I never found upgrades anyway, and the level design felt unnecessarily drawn out or repetative in many ways.  Ultimately, this game shows that a lot of quality work went into conceiving a game that would have been amazing to play, deeply immersive, and with many novel concepts, but somewhere in the process of development a line was drawn and deep concessions were made. Evidence that the games' potential was never realized is staring you in the face from start to finish. It is a shame really.
2919	0	a	The core game is average but, worth playing if you get this game on sale. My biggest issues are that I feel lonely when I roam this sort of 'realistic' world and it feels like an MMO that was changed last minute to a single-player experience.   Some Warnings - There is no cooperative play on this game and you must always be online (connected to EA servers) to play this single player experience.

2926	0	a	An ok adventure game. Feels kinda like an MMO, but single player... by that I mean it has a lot of 'fetch this meaningless crap for me.' Most quests are entirely forgettable. The game also masquerades as an RPG, with experience and levels and better gear and all that. Until you realize that all the zones scale up to you. So did you complete tons of quests and work really hard on getting awesome gear? Too bad cause the next zone is scaled up to your level so it doesn't mean jack.  In short this game commits many gaming sins, introduces nothing new, has a subpar story, and lackluster gameplay. I kept waiting for something cool to happen, it never does.  5/10

2933	0	a	A sort of hybrid of Fable and Skyrim, Amalur suffers because of its unoriginality. In the end, why play it? If you are looking for a skyrim-alike game, play that instead. Miss Fables? Play the original, for it is still the best.   Competently made and largely free of graphical or gameplay glitches, Amalur suffers from the greatest sin a video game can commit: it is boring.
2934	0	a	My first reaction to the game was: Graphics weren't what I was expecting, polished combat and extremely well made. But I quickly felt like there was something missing in this game. Something uncoherently mistaking. The combat feels really arcade as do the graphics but besides that there is areally polished RPG factor in it. You might say: that would be a positive thing. But I can't help but feel it does not match well together. Atleast for me it does not. The way I see it Kingdoms of Amalur is quite a big game, not seamingless, more like zones connected to each other. But the bland quests, not really appealing story and on the other hand good looks and superb combat makes me feel like I can't land my feet and immerse in the game.
2935	0	a	Boring, slow, clunky, and obviously something it was never meant to be. This was not meant to be a single player RPG, it was meant to be an MMORPG, and not even a good one, and not even for the PC. No MMO on the PC has this poor of an interface, this strange of movement, and this bad of an economy. Crafting and gold donâ€™t scale fast enough to match shop prices, so donâ€™t expect to buy more than one piece of gear when you go into town. Ultimately, my biggest issue is that the areas are so narrow. Compare to all MMOs, and you will find the every zone ringed by hills, most of which cannot be scaled. The difference is that, until a zone transitions, they are far away. If you stand in the center, you will need to walk a good distance to reach the cliffs. The walk from the middle to the edge is less than the distance to my bookcase.  Boring, poorly made, and poorly adapted. Shameful waste of the 5 bucks I spent on it.
2936	0	a	no jump / no auto run / messed up hot key system = fail for me  but if u dont care about those things then its a great rpg.
2937	0	a	Moderately â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game with far too easy of a combat system / gameplay, a storyline that tries to be rich and complex and detailed and just ends up being uninteresting while throwing far too much information at you, and graphics that feel like the entire thing is taking place in oldschool Ashenvale in World of Warcraft. Honestly. Areas all have a tint to them, and the first major one is pretty damn purple.  I've never regretted paying full price for a game more (Save maybe Fable 3), but that's what I get for buying EA.
2938	0	a	It feels like an attempt at an action MMORPG where they ran out of time to complete the networking so they just released it anyway as a singleplayer game. The combat is mediocre at best with no depth so it gets repetitive, requiring you to spend hours levelling before you can begin to do anything slightly diverse. It feels kind of unresponsive because some animations for attacks take so long and you can't even dodge-cancel out of them. The world is really big and beautiful though but ultimately meaningless without good gameplay. The camera is also really close, so close it's almost nauseating.
2939	0	a	It starts good but after 20 minutes of gameplay, apart from the bland quests, found a box with all powerfull weapons and with that all game completely become so easy to be uninstalled.  'Kingdoms of Amalur is essentially an MMO without the multiplayer. Leaving you stuck with lackluster NPCs, fetch/kill quests, and a world that just seems... empty. The upside? Incredible combat, additionally marred by a camera that doesn't really know what it wants to do'  I completely agree!
2940	0	a	This game has one of the best action mechanics i've played, but it's just too long and it starts to get very boring and repetitive, I've played this a lot and didn't gt to end it yet
2941	0	a	This game is all about grinding. The only PC video options are what resolution you want to use. It plays like a single player MMO.
2942	0	a	The only fun part of this game is being a criminal, combats great too....everythings else is just a tad boring.
2943	0	a	Invisible walls restricting movement. There's mouse acceleration. The developers do not fix problems with the game, so if there is anything completely game-breaking, you're boned.  Three strikes, and you're out. Do not buy this game.
2944	0	a	To clarify, the GAME is fun, and I would recommend it. The DLC **DO NOT BUY**. There are a lot of little bugs and glitches, and all of them can be overlooked....except for a few. Which will literally end your time playing on that character. The Dead-Kel expansion was what stopped me. After defeating him, my companion spawned dead next to him, and remained dead when escaping the tunnel where there are 2 cave-ins which the companion gets teleported imbetween before coming to a dead-end beach. The idea is, your companion will be teleported to that spot so they don't get too far behind and will follow you onto the beach where you will be teleported out after speaking with them. Sadly, if your companion is dead, and you don't have multiple save spots, your game simply ends here. If your companion is stuck but alive, there's an exploit you can do which will cause it to get 'un-stuck' and you can hopefully continue with your game.   The game is insanely easy, even on Hard difficulty. Once you get a set-piece with +1hp regen, you'll almost never need to use a potion ever again. It's just sad, that I couldn't play it through just to see the story and was cut short due to a horrible game design. The company is disbanded and won't be patching a fix for it, so I'll save you the time now, and tell you to just keep moving along and find another game. Or don't play any of the DLC's.....or....have a lot of different saves because you'll never know how far back you'll need to restart to compensate for bugs.
2945	0	a	Fable, Darksiders, Oblivion and (of course) World of Warcraft â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and produce one utterly unremarkable product. However, if you're a citizen of Rhode Island, you could probably buy this game instead of paying taxes.
2946	0	a	Every review is positive here, so im going to bring up the bad stuff about this game, and what other games does better.  Where do I start?  Your character is glued to the ground to start with. You cannot jump. The map is big, but because of the glued to the ground issue, and the way they built the enviroment, its tedious as **** to walk around in the world. Rocks, tree-roots, rivers and small valleys. Walk around and find the way down/over/around. Tedious. Also, the only way to 'jump' down a valley or such, is to find a small wooden ramp. Then you press F and the character jumps down. The height of these will blow your mind. The world itself is big. Not HUUUUGE like the other wants you to think. Its not a free world like gta or skyrim, you go where they want you to go.   Monsters/enemies. They are not very varied. Same stuff to kill over and over. (Fighting/combat is fun however so its 50/50)  Reused textures/enviroments. Makes me angry, this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ right here. The caves that exists everywhere all look alike. Small differences but still big sections are the same everywhere. Kinda ruins the feeling.  Leveling up is fine, so is the weapons dmg, types and so on.  This game has nothing that skyrim doesn't do better. Looting and taking everything in the chest, you have to use the mouse to press 'take all'. And you loot a lot, A LOT. So small irratating things like these are everywhere.  Fighting upphill? To bad, if you have ranged weapons/magic they will go straight forward, into the ground.    Story is ok. Good concept, poorly executed.  PROS: Combat feels nice and looks good, WOW style. Big enemies, bosses and such are really fun to fight.  CONS: The game is EASY. Im playin on hard right now and it feels like easy. This game has nothing on other games in the same genrÃ©.  Conclusion: Save your money.
2947	0	a	Gets boring fast. THe skill trees for different classes are intriguing, but the nature of the combat in game usually means every fight devolves into a melee regardless of your class.  For your money, you're much better off going with the Darksiders franchise.
2948	0	a	If you are expecting to use an Xbox controller with this game you are mistaken until EA or Big Huge fixes the mapping it is unplayable. You would think that this being a released on console they would have got it right on PC but as it is now it is currently unplayable with the 360 Controller. KB&amp;M work fine but this game was made for a controller, a controller that you cannot use because 1 button is mapped to 7 different actions and cannot be remapped. Makes using a 360 controller impossible. No fix on the any of the forums either..... If you want to play with KB&amp;M go for it might be a good game but if you might ever want to use a controller save your money itâ€™s unplayable
2949	0	a	Multiple incomplete gameplay mechanics does not make one complete game. Nor does a lacklustre story and overly generic setting make for an interesting adventure for that part.  Looking for a mindless way to kill a large mount of time? Welcome. Looking for something actually interesting and engaging? Look elsewhere.

2952	0	a	Well, I played this game for at least 38h now, which is not very much compared to some other ones I played. But the difference is: To play this game feels more like work than fun to me. I know, the points I'll criticize are very subjective, but that's the thing with critics, so no offense to the ones who love this game, it just doesn't seem to be my style. ;)  Story/Quests:  Ã„hem. First a confession: I didn't finish it. Yeah. Sorry. It was just not interesting enough. There are epic bossfights, a very, very evil overlord, a war and you as - of course - the chosen one. At least everything you need for a high-fantasy RPG. NPC's are exchangeable all over the place, I cannot even remember a single name. Much less their background.  The main Quests are okay, the 'guild'-Quests also, the rest is too often just filler (Kill X to get Y and bring it to Z), nothing memorable.  World/Graphic: It's colorful. Very colorful. So colorful that I cannot take this game as serious as it wants to be. All this quirky, comic-like fairy-stuff... I mean, even the supposed 'Dark' areas are kinda sweet!  The Graphics themselves are okay, not state of the art, but it's a game from 2012, so - oh, wait... 2012? ... Yeah, they could have done it better then. But it's still not 'bad', just 'okay'.  The map is gigantic and you are free to walk where you want. Unless you walk against a rock. Or against any other obstacle on your path. Even if it's just waist-high. And that upsets me every time in every game! But the music is lovely!   Fighting/Level System: The Action is nice, there are a lot of cool moves you can do, some really powerful spells and techniques. All combined, it makes quite fun to slay all that monsters. And if you are as bored as me by the story (but still not bored enough to quit yet), you might also regard the looting and levelling as your last source of long-term motivation. Also the game has a cool crafting-system, it's diversive and sometimes useful at the same time!  RPG really is my genre of choice, but it seems that I'm not a colorful, very-high-fantasy kind of player... I really gave it many chances to thrill me, but the atmosphere, the story, the character - all that failed to thrill me.
2953	0	a	World isn't immersive as the quests are very similar to MMO's. No challenge or effort put into them whatsoever.  Combat system is highly similar to Fable 2 and Fable 3. However, this does not matter as the actual game world feels dead. It honestly feels like I'm playing an MMO that died years ago and I'm the only player online. None of my in-game accomplishments really matter in the game world because everyone praises you no matter what you do.  You could scratch your bottom, rub your crap-stank fingers on a princesses nose and she will praise you for being the saviour of humanity. It's horse wank.   I don't know what to call this game. RPG? Open world? Sure. But it's VERY average. It does not compare to games like Dragon Age, Skyrim, Two Worlds 2 or anything of that caliber.   Buy it when it's on sale for $5. NOT worth the full price. I regret paying for it to be honest.  6/10
2954	0	a	- Found it hard to play with the current camera setup, couldnt zoom out any further(or at least find a way to do so) and this ruined the game for me. - mediocre gfx even for 2012, pretty sure my galaxy s4 can do better. - Tried to like it and pushed through to the 1st town but after receiving multiple random quests pretty much from nowhere i found that the whole feel of the game was underwhelming and a little outdated. - Unsure of all the reviews giving it awesome scores etc, as this was not the case for me. - If your looking for that game of all games, then i would suggest looking elsewhere as this is no ground breaker.
2955	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur has stopped working, Is all I paid my money for, this rubbish doesn't even work.
2956	0	a	meh, it gets a little boring after a while. the game story doesnt have much depth, and it cant really compare to other games like skyrim. its fun at first but then once you realize it, it gets boring. Not too much to do in the game. If you are looking for a free world rpg, get skyrim instead of this game
2957	0	a	Someone compared this game to skyrim, which was a reason for me to get it. Well, turns out it wasnt, besides the fact that it indeed is a single player 3rd person rpg. To be fair, I stopped playing this game after a couple of hours (after reaching the Sidhe and completing the House of Ballads Questline), so I do not know if it gets any better. However, I really doubt it does. The Reasons are:   - the universe didnt really get me hooked. the graphics are very colourful and opulent, lots of eyecandy everywhere. But that does not help in any way to immerse me into the story. The atmosphere is sterile and feels more like a kitschy elven-themepark than a deep mystical forest full of dangers and fantastic creatures.  - the story sucks. Its just boring. The elves have split up in good and bad. The bad ones want to kill everybody, so you have to fight for the good elves to save the world. Yippieyeah, wake me up when its over please... Also, the quests are mostly senseless like rescue a guy in a cave, find a dead body, kill a troll, kill another troll, kill three trolls at once, kill a troll and a mage, stuff like that. Why you do this? Believe me, you stop to care after the third or fourth quest even though the voice acting is excellent, its most often stuff like Monsters attacked me, I lost something please bring it to me. why do I even listen to these bums on the road? Could just as well just walk around kill everything that moves. Which is pretty much all you do in this game.
2958	0	a	Just downloaded the game,when the registration information pops up, the video goes dark...even though I can still hear sound. I can Shift + tab and a screen pops up. Screen is only pitch black when I am trying to type in my information...Can anyone assist with this so I can actually play this game and enjoy it? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
2959	0	a	Yes, the combat is exciting and dynamic. Yes, this game has a huge number of loots... and Yes, this game tons of side quests. Yes, the world is large - OK, the world is gorgeous.  However, despite sinking numerous hours into this game, you'll still find this game somewhat lacking. It has a very uninteresting story. Quests, both main and side, are highly repetitive. I mean, hell - Diablo does have an even more boring story (it doesn't really have one, right?) but I feel a different kind of boredom playing this game - possibly due to the huge world, or samey environment everywhere.  By all means, get this game if you like the flashy combat experience (as said above, it has a decent combat system). But don't expect it to be anything interesting outside of combat. And don't even compare this game to Skyrim, where the world is much more dynamic.
2960	0	a	Many people will make the mistake of playing this game like a single-player experience. They will try to be completionists, working to finish every quest they can find.  Unfortunately, this game plays more like an MMO, which is to say there is far more content than you can hope to complete before you become over-leveled.  This also means, however, that you often can't tell the difference between a quickie one-shot quest that takes ten minutes to complete and a six-part branching quest chain that ends in a fantastic and unique reward you'll be grateful to have.  Play the game through with a guide if you want to get the most bang for your buck. Otherwise, play it casually. I don't think there's a medium to be discovered that could be considered entertaining.
2961	0	a	I really wanted to like this game, and I do in part. This was better on the consol. The camera angle is horrible and the fact that you can't target really crushes it for me. The leveling and quest are nice. The graphics are solid not amazing. I really like the way you pick a class and skills but thats about it. As everybody else has said the camera and targeting system really fails it. I would give it a C
2962	0	a	Really disappointing game. Takes two great game series -- Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age -- and perversely combines their negatives (from the former, an unvoiced player character traveling alone; from the latter, a world of constrained spaces and absurd, occasionally degrading character design), in the service of a plot that just isn't all that engaging. Combat mechanics are somewhat interesting; they're the only part of the game that is, and they can't rescue some of the combat encounters from being entirely too lengthy, tedious and occasionally frustrating. After about 30 hours, I got bored with the story and the world and stopped playing.
2963	0	a	Played the game on xbox and loved the story and gameplay in general, wanted to replay it on my pc, but it's simply not the same, there are just too many annoying glitches. The most annoying is the various crashes, i'm simply not a fan of a game that crashes whenever i try to save or quick save, makes it hard to maintain a delightful gameplay.
2964	0	a	i didnt enjoy it cause it just seems to much like Dragons Age Origins. If it was more free roam and more army vs army instead of like every hacknslash game out there
2965	0	a	KoA is... a fantasy game. Pretty standard stuff. Too standard.  Maybe it is just me... I mean, I've loved the fantasy genre for most of my life. But I'm getting older, and these days, for a fantasy game to really grab a hold of me, it really has to stand out - to be unique and original - to contain at least some aspect that every other fantasy game hasn't already beaten into the ground.  I didn't see anything original or unique in KoA. I admit I only played it for half a dozen hours... but I think I played for long enough that, if it were going to grab me, it should have by then. And it didn't.  Combat was okay, but it felt pretty generic. Just like everything else about the gameplay, story and characters.  I hate to be so harsh; I'm sure there are other fantasy fans out there who would probably enjoy this. But at this point in my gaming life, I'm looking for a new spin on fantasy. Games like Dark Souls that approach fantasy from a whole new angle and aesthetic. I'm getting really sick of elves and orcs and epic battles against ancient evils where the world always hangs in the balance and it's always clear who the hero is (usually you).  If you want another fantasy game like all the others you've played (and there's nothing wrong with that) - KoA could be for you. It was not for me.
2966	0	a	First impressions were not positive.  -World of Warcraft is a strong influence. The narrative, visuals &amp; voice acting are boilerplate. If you've played WoW you already know how the story will be told and what it will look &amp; sound like, right down to the elves &amp; gnomes.  -The combat system is derived from God of War, perhaps? It works well for melee combat, but casting and archery are relegated to auto-targeting and feel dull.   -All player characters are male.  -The menus are awkward; lots of decending and ascending through menu-after-sub-menu with little aesthetic flare.   -The much maligned quick-time event also makes an appearance. I ignored it, but my character still produced a gigantic spear of pure light which he proceeded to plunge through his adversary' s face.
2967	0	a	Fable, Darksiders, Oblivion and (of course) World of Warcraft â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and produce one utterly unremarkable product. However, if you're a citizen of Rhode Island, you could probably buy this game instead of paying taxes.
2968	0	a	Every review is positive here, so im going to bring up the bad stuff about this game, and what other games does better.  Where do I start?  Your character is glued to the ground to start with. You cannot jump. The map is big, but because of the glued to the ground issue, and the way they built the enviroment, its tedious as **** to walk around in the world. Rocks, tree-roots, rivers and small valleys. Walk around and find the way down/over/around. Tedious. Also, the only way to 'jump' down a valley or such, is to find a small wooden ramp. Then you press F and the character jumps down. The height of these will blow your mind. The world itself is big. Not HUUUUGE like the other wants you to think. Its not a free world like gta or skyrim, you go where they want you to go.   Monsters/enemies. They are not very varied. Same stuff to kill over and over. (Fighting/combat is fun however so its 50/50)  Reused textures/enviroments. Makes me angry, this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ right here. The caves that exists everywhere all look alike. Small differences but still big sections are the same everywhere. Kinda ruins the feeling.  Leveling up is fine, so is the weapons dmg, types and so on.  This game has nothing that skyrim doesn't do better. Looting and taking everything in the chest, you have to use the mouse to press 'take all'. And you loot a lot, A LOT. So small irratating things like these are everywhere.  Fighting upphill? To bad, if you have ranged weapons/magic they will go straight forward, into the ground.    Story is ok. Good concept, poorly executed.  PROS: Combat feels nice and looks good, WOW style. Big enemies, bosses and such are really fun to fight.  CONS: The game is EASY. Im playin on hard right now and it feels like easy. This game has nothing on other games in the same genrÃ©.  Conclusion: Save your money.
2969	0	a	Gets boring fast. THe skill trees for different classes are intriguing, but the nature of the combat in game usually means every fight devolves into a melee regardless of your class.  For your money, you're much better off going with the Darksiders franchise.
2970	0	a	If you are expecting to use an Xbox controller with this game you are mistaken until EA or Big Huge fixes the mapping it is unplayable. You would think that this being a released on console they would have got it right on PC but as it is now it is currently unplayable with the 360 Controller. KB&amp;M work fine but this game was made for a controller, a controller that you cannot use because 1 button is mapped to 7 different actions and cannot be remapped. Makes using a 360 controller impossible. No fix on the any of the forums either..... If you want to play with KB&amp;M go for it might be a good game but if you might ever want to use a controller save your money itâ€™s unplayable
2971	0	a	Multiple incomplete gameplay mechanics does not make one complete game. Nor does a lacklustre story and overly generic setting make for an interesting adventure for that part.  Looking for a mindless way to kill a large mount of time? Welcome. Looking for something actually interesting and engaging? Look elsewhere.
2972	0	a	I do enjoy the game, and I think it is a good way to quench your thirst for a game of this style. With more work this game could have really been amazing. An active modding community would even be plenly enough to save it. But sadly we will not be seeing any more progress on it. I suck at adding pros so i'll just be going into the details on the cons. (sorry if i am a bit too harsh)  Worth the purchase?  I would say the game is worth a buy when it is on sale, or if you are like me and don't have a pc able to run things like The Witcher 3 or Shadow of Mordor.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  + Overall fun gameplay and combat. Easy to get into and can find a good amount of things to do.  + The main story is pretty good. Really new and interesting plot.  + The respec system allows you to completely change your playstyle at any point for a small fee of gold.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  - Poor difficulty scaling.  Apparently when you enter a new area, it locks that area to your current level. So if you progress too fast or, like me, end up charging across the map in search of a challenge, the whole game becomes a cakewalk. (besides a few special enemies that do stupidly high damage compared to the rest)  I have heard that this also works for chests, so looting everything too early will hurt you in the end.  - Conversations seem to be lacking. Persuasion skill is useless.  I quickly found myself skipping through dialogue to reach choices to get past it, that often make no difference besides the next line the npc says. I even tried to make a few npcs hate me but nothing happened. (And apparently I am now lovers with some girl even though all I did was use her boat.)  The Persuasion skill, having 10 whole ranks, only affects the chance for you to succeed in rare, often pointless dialogue options, that you could just pass by quicksaving/loading. There are also a couple milestones in it, but all they do is slightly lower the cost of bribes for crimes.  - Equipment.  Many people say that upgrading your blacksmithing skill makes getting good gear too easy, but it seemed like the opposite for me. With max rank blacksmithing i only ever made a few items worth using since I could never find good materials , and ended up just selling all of my loot and purchasing better gear from shops.  Armor sets just stink. I have done a lot of exploring and looting but have never found more than 2 parts of a set besides when given to me. And even if I had, my gear would still be far better. Same story for most of the special weapons I get.  - Side quests are annoying.  There are a few I have done that I found interesting and enjoyable, but mostly it just became a case of skipping through, accepting everything, just doing them as I went to an area with an objective there.  This could also just be because I have played too many mmoprgs.  - Not enough variety in enemies.  Throughout the game you will be finding the same enemies even in far different settings, such as trolls, spiders, and pretty much any people. Even being in different reigons and factions, they will have the same attacks and skills.  - Plenty of annoying bugs and things that could do with improvement.  I have had quests break multiple times, even once before causing me to have to start a whole new game.  When you disable an enemy in reckoning mode, your character will still try to target them.  And many more little issues...
2973	0	a	this is a game that i withstood against buying for some time yet i wanted to give it a try cus I heard that one of my favourite author ''RA Salvatore'' took place in the game and here what i think: + ; cool, action-packed gameplay nice graphs open world, yet this may become problematic after a point... variety in monsters. - ; uninteresting story, plot no matter how hard you try, things are so dissatisfying. shallow after sometime you get bored. i dont find the game very addictive repetitive crafting system... 6/10 
2974	0	a	I really really tried forcing myselfe to continue playing but i simply couldn't. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoningâ„¢ starts off as a great concept and at first it seems like a really fun hack and slash with a lot of customisation and strong RPG-Elements. But it isn't. You'll find yourselfe spamming the same 3 combos all the time while getting annoyed of hundrets of MMORGP-like Sidequests. I heared you people love +/- Lists so here you go!  The Good + Character customisation. You really have a lot of options and skills to chose from. You can also customise the apperance of your charater but the options are very limited so don't expect it to be as complex as in TES-Games.  + Voice Acting. Honestly i haven't seen the entire game but so far i think all NPCs where well voiced. With one huge exception. Your own character. All your character has are texts you can choose in Dialoges and the 'uh' 'uah' 'ah' in combat. This actally doesn't bother me too much as it's already a common thing in a lot of RPGs.  + Open World. There is actally a lot of loot and other stuff to look for. Would be a huge + if the game was genarally good.  + Decisions. Yay! I cannot tell you how much effect they have on the world around you but at least you can make some.  The Meh ~ Enemies. Not much variety for such a huge world but many of them require unique strategies to deal with them without losing too much life. For many of them it's recommended to learn their attacks and how to counter them.  The Bad - Generic MMORPG feeling. The Quests are getting boring after the first few hours and even if there is a huge effort to make the Quests interesing, it still felt like brainless EXP-grinding.  - Tons of Sidequests. Wait, how is that a bad thing? Well if the game isn't fun at all you don't want to waste hours over hours doing minor stuff so you can keep up with the level of your enemies.  - Combat. If the combat gets dull and boring in a game build around combat nothing else can safe the game from a bad score. The combat it repetitive and boring. At first it seems fresh and fun but after a few hours in you'll see how boring it gets when you spam the same stuff over and over again with the wepons(s) of your choice.  - Bugs. Tbh i haven't encountered any but i haven't made it far enough into the game to get to the buggy parts of it. Quests cannot be completed if you do stuff in the wrong order and things like that. So a lot of save slots are highly recommended.  - EA Account. Yes, it's one of those games where you have to make a third party account and have to be online to play a singleplayer game.  - Inventory. A barely sorted List of Stuff, that you can only extend buying a limited Number of Backpacks from some NPCs. This is the Part where you clearly see that this game is a console port.  3.5/10 Because EA didn't pay me
2975	0	a	I honestly can't recommend Kingdoms of Amalur unless you buy it on sale. It isn't a bad game, but it certainly isn't good, either.  Some of the major problems I have with it include a terrible camera, generic story and setting, boring and uninspired RPG elements, bloated busywork sidequests, and a combat system that would be fun if not for groups of enemies that stunlock the crap out of you.   That said, I DO think it is a decent timesink if you are looking for one. I just think that your money is going to be better spent elsewhere.
2976	0	a	It's a fun game to start, but could be much shorter. So many of the quests are 'fetch 10 of this' or 'kill 10 of that'. It gets boring quickly. I feel as though they made a massive world, put the main story in, then realized it was still mostly empty.  I outleveled every zone quickly before finishing most of the faction and side quests, forcing me to increase the difficulty just for a sense of fun.   You can respec at any time, so there is no reason to play through more than once.  I haven't quite finished all the DLC, and I don't plan to do so.  It's a decent game and the world had potential, but I think it missed the mark. I'd recommend something else for your fantasy-rpg fix.
2977	0	a	15 hours into the game and I encountered a bug which makes it impossible for me to progress further into the game. Apparently I have to restart to get it to work.  No thank you.
2978	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is at odds with itself. On the one hand, it strives to be an epic fantasy along the lines of Skyrim or Oblivion (or even WoW). On the other, it is an arcade action game. The arcade part is fun. The rest... not so much. The backstory and the lore are dull, as are most of the voice actors. Quests are generally interesting... many are simple fetch quests or kill monster X at location Y. But many are multi-part with intriguing backstory.  The story has something to do with your character be exempt from fate because you were resurrected from the dead. And other characters want to help or exploit you. Or something like that. But, as a whole, it just doesn't come together. There's nothing compelling about the story. The mini-games pale in comparison to their Bethesda counterparts. I clicked through every dialog tree as quickly as possible. There are stones scattered in the world which, when touched, divulge some of the lore via a voice-over. I couldn't pay attention to a single one of them.   Now, on the combat side, it resembles more of a Darksiders flair. You roll around to avoid enemy attacks and wait for the right moment to close and shred your opponent. Some monsters just absorb hits until they die. Others will take a few before striking back. The only downside is that it becomes repetitive. Each dungeon has the same types of monsters, reasonbly spread across the map. But after my 5th encounter with kobolds, for instance, I was ready to move on.  Kingdoms of Amalur sports an RPG element. Your character levels up and points can be allocated into different skill trees. Some of them unlock cool moves that can be used in combat. Others unlock world exploration skills like alchemy (dull), lockpicking (dull), finding hidden stashes (dull), and the like. And, you can re-roll your character at any time -- a feature that I haven't used yet, but appreciate that it is there.  The game is definitely on the easy side, especially if you avail yourself of the powerful weapons available at the start of the game. Set the game on hard and pick less damaging weapons (like daggers) to make the game more exciting.   Nevertheless, with six hours into the game, I'm probably done with it. It hasn't grabbed me. And, as a gamer with limited time for gaming, I have to be engaged from the first moment. The story needs to be compelling. The characters (especially my character) need to be intriguing; their dialog something I listen to with rapt interest. And if not that, then the action needs to be exciting. Perhaps if it mixed the combat with some Prince of Persia like platforming elements, and downplayed the story/RPG stuff?  It feels too much like a couple of different incomplete games all squished together into a mostly ineffective whole. It's not enough to keep my interest.
2979	0	a	KoA: Reckoning is a single player take on the MMORPG formula complete with hundreds of uninspired fetch-quests and tedious, loot-driven character progression. I am actually relieved to have suffered a game-breaking bug 23 hours in, as I hadn't been enjoying myself since the 15-hour mark.
2980	0	a	Well.... when it came out, the developers advertised so well, that I choose it over skyrim. After I played the game I regerted my decision. The game is fine, it has refreshing story scent to it. Everything you do feels like a fantasy novel. However, it does not have the open worldness that it advertises, compared to skyrim which you can do much, reckoning's degree of freedom is very limited.
2981	0	a	Meh...you either love it or you dont, gets abit boring :(
2982	0	a	Bland, forgetable and frustrating. I'm sure I'd be able to appreciate the nice art assets if the camera were not so close to the character and mostly focused on the floor.
2983	0	a	I played this game back then and decided to finish it this time around because of the Steam Sales.   It's a decent game but it has a lot of flaws. If you can stomach those flaws then you'll probably like the game.    -Story and Charcters are your every cliche in a fantasy setting. Overall the story isn't interesting and the characters aren't compelling. It's hard to even care much for most of the NPCs.  -They use the same voice actors multiple times and it starts to get weird that every other character or NPC sounds about the same.  -Invisible walls! Tiny pieces of cobblestone or rocks can become impassable although you should by all rights be able to walk over it. You're basically a demigod near the end and you still can't jump over certain terrain that visually you should be able to.  -The game has a lot of tedious fetch quest and it hurts since your character runs so slowly.  -The travel time between quests. Fast travel helps but you most of the quests are in between locations and you have to run slowly looking for items or NPCs.  -Very stiff contorls. It basically means that combos can often become awkward and that you can't cancel an attack once you click on the button. It just feels so STATIC although the attack animations and combos plus different weapon tactics are somewhat entertaining the first time around.   -Crafting in the game is a chore and more of an afterthought. You'll have no reason to use it once your character is upgraded enough and you can find better items through loot drops or chests.   When it was released it had nothing new to offer the genre and it didn't age gracefully either.
2984	0	a	This is a good game, just not a very good game. It has two things going for it: the story is alright (I especially liked the Teeth of Naros DLC) and the visuals are bloody amazing. However, the game is simply littered with horrendous design choices that make it fall short. Its name should be Extreme Walking Simulator. 1% of the game is talking to people, fighting etc while the other 99% is bloody walking; and the map is gigantic! I would recommend that you try this for yourself, but I can't recommend in good faith that you finish it.
2985	0	a	This game was not future proofed at all it seems. It struggles on windows 10 and for some strange reason having an Xbox One controller plugged into your PC will make the audio scratchy or cut out entirely. Xbox360 controllers work fine and the game is fun... but unless you have an old 360 controller and an older version of windows DO NOT BUY IT. IT WON'T WORK. I would love to recommend the game, but with how fast people are upgrading these days, chances are it won't be able to be played from your game library sooner rather than later.
2986	0	a	Too easy, even on hard difficulty. Calling that hard is a joke. Nice atmosphere but no challenge, therefore boring.
2987	0	a	I'd go into depth, but I really don't want to put the effort into something; no one is probably going to read.  Story is kind of boring. Basically you're some chosen one, who can change fate. Environments are kind of dull a lot of flat plains, and corridor dungeons. There's really no exploration. Combat isn't very fluid, although I only played a sorceror. Lore is boring, they have books, but they never captutred my attention. The dialogue is boring. You get choices, in to what you're saying, but in the end they're all the same. Even with pursuasion, it doesn't even have any real benefits. i gets repetitive and boring.
2988	0	a	-Boring -Repetitive -Weak Story -No Character Background -Quests are just fetch and kill -NPCs are badly designed -Very Limited Character Customization

2990	0	a	This game actually started out the most enjoyable of the last several hack &amp; slash RPGs I purchased. The combat system is quite nice, and apart from the wonky camera controls, everything else feels good. Unfortunately, Several hours in, the game auto-saved immediately AFTER i unsuccessfully disarmed a booby trap on a chest. When I try to load the game, it goes straight to the game over screen. My options are to replay the first 2-3 days, or to uninstall and forget it. For now, I'm moving on to The Witcher 2.
2991	0	a	Bugged. Don't buy it.
2992	0	a	My first impressions of this game were that it would be an immersive and exciting gameplay expierence. I can understand why people like this game but I can't stand it. It's a graphically down graded hack-n-slash rip off of games like Fable. But if I had to pick one thing about this game it would be the graphics. Now I know you should not ever complain about graphics in a game but this is an exception. During the trailer and all of screenshots they look nothing like the game on the Highest detail which leads me to belive they pulled a Watch_Dogs and used a graphics option that isn't made available to the consumer. Overall I'd give this game a 6/10, many things that are unique but had they not followed every single cliche in games liek this, being the 'Chosen one', having God Like powers etc. etc. I would have really loved the game. Either way, waste of money.
2993	0	a	Despite my NO rating - this game is not bad. If it's your first time experiencing an RPG, i would recommend this game, since it's on sale. Unfortunately i found this game boring, due to the constant talking and side questions. The controls arent the best and i felt no feelings for the game.  For friends considering buying this game. - If you have played other RPG games then there will be nothing interesting about this game. You would be better off starting a WoW subscription again or start on the game WildStar.
2994	0	a	Way to easy even on hardcore mode. I didn't even have to try on the hardest setting; when a game is this easy it gets old fast.
2995	0	a	MMO style single player rpg, too easy even on hard difficulty.
2996	0	a	Ran into a bug that would have required losing only about 2 hours of play time. I realized that I had stopped enjoying the game about 30 hours ago and had no interest in replaying anything.  This game is a deluge of repetitive fetch quests. If you're going to buy this, only play the main quest line and don't burn out like I did.
2997	0	a	I've played too much WoW for this to be enjoyable. The combat is good-ish, but is hampered by the fact that the game even on hard mode isn't actually hard (infact I'd say that hard is very easy, especially if you try to finish all the quests in each zone and get overgeared). I would not recommend this game because this game lacks the polish that I'd expect from a single player RPG, and lacks the multiplayer advantages from an MMORPG. I completed the first four zones or so and found the game to be just too easy/monotonous to be enjoyable, and thus will not be finishing the entire thing. But if there's one thing I can say is that this game has A LOT of content (apparently anyway, I'm not sticking around to find out.), so if you can buy it cheap go for it.

2999	0	a	Some basic tips for the Standard difficulty.  1) Do all the available side quests before advancing the main quests.  2) Do not mix Finesse and Magic trees unless you can find daggers equal to your level. They aren't nearly as common as they should be. Otherwise, you can't handle enough damage and don't kill things quickly enough.  3) Dodging is not as useful as the game claims for two reasons.  3a) Dodge doesn't give you any tactical positioning. In fact, most of the time you end up with your back to an opponent that's already turned to face you, so you end up repeat dodging just to get clear without getting it while they follow you.  3b) Certain bosses are too fast for dodging to be useful. Or they have AoE's that are too large to escape with a dodge. There's also fighting multiple opponents at once. They flank and they knock you off balance long enough to hit you again.  4) Amp your resistances up like your life depends on it. It does.  5) Load up on potions. Your life depends on these too.  If you leave any of these tips out, be prepared for frustration and loud cursing.  Oh, and don't count on the NPC's that sometimes accompany you to be useful. They're not. They can't deal damage worth sneezing at, and some of them spend more time rolling around than stabbing things.  Last Tip: The boss at the Hyperian is multi-stage. Be careful about using Fate Mode on him too early. This is the one that got me so frustrated I uninstalled the game.  Enjoy!
3000	0	a	The game itself is pretty bland, there's whole world that nobody cares about with the usual kind of environments (forest, plains, desert, etc). Quests often have interesting premises but the tasks themselves are the usual go from point A to point B, fetch/kill/activate a thing there, come back for a reward. The combat is alright but it gets very repetitive because combat is all you ever do. The crafting system is interesting but it isn't enough to save this game. The music is nothing memorable, but can't say anything bad about it either. Also, there is a game ending glitch in the Dead Kel DLC, so beware of that. I'd say this game isn't worth the time you're gonna spend on it, so don't buy it, even if it's on sale. 4/10
3001	0	a	Finally decided to uninstall this - tried to play this on-and-off but it doesn't hold my interest, the game is like a fancy sword that lives in a scabbard which blunts itself when it's drawn. + Big game, lots of side quests, lots of dialogue - Boring quests, boring characters, boring mobs, over level for main quest + Lots of loot, crafting with alchemy and smithing - Too little inventory space, over powered weapons make the game too easy + Lots of different locations - Very same-ish dungeons, with boring travel to each new location (sparse mobs placement)  Dodge mechanic would have made this extremely easy game already too easy - except hit boxes and attack timings seem all wrong. You can roll out of the way but still get hit. But your gear will by mitigating so much damage that you can just tank everything even as a caster. One hit bosses totally possible because the side-quest will over level you. The game is 70% travelling, 20% mowing down boring enemies and 10% skipping mundane dialogue. If you want lots of mediocre content for cheap, this game is great on sale. Can't recommend though.
3002	0	a	Don't get me wrong. I love this game - great atmosphere, cool universe and species, nice graphics, pretty well polished. A wonderful example that Dragon Age's influence on the western RPG landscape wasn't a bad thing at all.  However, the plot is so damn slow. It drives me insane. I've stopped playing this game not because I don't enjoy playing it, but because I just can't get anywhere meaningful or do anything interesting. It's like a tech demo. Look at this cool RPG engine we built, anyone want to make a sweet game in it?
3003	0	a	While having some great concepts and mechanics, overall this game feel like playing a mediocre MMO solo all the time. The quests are all follow the dot and then run all the way back to turn it in, combat is pretty simplistic and I hvae found no real reason to actually pay attention to the dialogue or the extra information that you have no need for. The controls are also sluggish at times, where you will press keys multiple times and nothing wil happen. Your Power Up ability (X) also does this where you will be pressingit constantly but the mode is never entered.   So all in all, it is a decent MMO style single player RPG that offers little new to refresh the tired and overused components.
3004	0	a	I cant play. Every time I try to start a new game, it says that Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoningâ„¢ has stopped working. Any Help?
3005	0	a	Way too linear. Very disapointing.
3006	0	a	A perfect example of a game that looked so good on paper but was executed so badly it was exiled to a corner and no one wants to mention it today. All in all KoA: Reckoning is a solid RPG, it has a huge world with tons of NPC's and quests, it has rich lore behind the world that, most of the time, makes sense, and the game introduces things like the lorestones and Reckoning Mode to spice things up both on the RP side and the Action side.  Unfortunately pretty much every aspect of this game falls flat. The talent system is pretty redundant and mostly serve to give you passive bonuses you can fit your playstyle around (!), as any true RPG blacksmithing and enchanting is as overpowered as a Predator and the dialog is sometimes so bad that you wish you bought the game on a CD-disc just so you could throw it out the window.  All in all, if you're looking for the next Icewind Dale, Masquerade: Bloodlines or Dark Souls, this is not it. But if you wish for a Bulletstorm with magic instead of guns then this game will cuddle and snuggle you warm forever. Or at least the 50hours it takes to explore the world.
3007	0	a	Unable to finish the game due to 2 gamebreaking bugs that cause the mainquest to not advance and those cannot be 'fixed' by yourself. No gamesupport whatsoever.   Don't buy it.
3008	0	a	Crashes during the first playable segment of the Game. None of the fixes found online worked.
3009	0	a	Bugs everywhere . The damn bugs cause you to uninstall this god damn game . I stuck in the dead kel quest and nothing i can do to solve that bug .So I just waste my money to buy this game . Surely not worth my money .
3010	0	a	I have actually enjoyed my time playing the game, but the crashes are just too numerous and I have to call it quits. I can't recommend it, especially for a game that utilizes manual saves.
3011	0	a	Played this game on a console a year or so ago and I liked it. Now I can't play more than 5 hours of it and I don't know why.                                                                                              hey dad i thought we only play thouchy touch on wednesdays
3012	0	a	Good: -Resonably good premise. -Interesting original Faction Storylines. -Unique Combat System.  Bad: -90% of enemies/zones/quest structures/character models are recycled. -ClichÃ© telling of previously-mentioned premise. -Boring repetetive sidequests have you forgetting what the main quest actually is. -No interesting/memorable characters.  Sophisticated Conclusion: It's sooooo boring :'(
3013	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning poor game. fix bugs.
3014	0	a	It's as if there was a guy who had a rediculous amount of money, loved video games and had unlimited amounts of time to do absolutely nothing with got really really stoned in the midst of an incredible acid trip and thought to himself, 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I could do that.'  Then he sold everything he owned and tried doing exactly that.  He failed of course, but the manner in which he failed was so spectacular that it serves as a lesson to everyone in the industry: Rely on the foundation of money and you will fail.  Bottom line? GUI sucks my balls, story is meh and I was left in total dismay about almost everything in the game. Terrible. If it were free and I was paid $20 an hour to finish this game I would quit before lunchtime.
3015	0	a	Ok, so Kingdoms of Amalur. After watching the trailer when it was on sale, and looking up some reviews, I decided to buy it. Straight off the bat, I came across my first problem. When the game was done downloading, I counldnt see anything. I can hear the audio just fine, but the visuals didnt show. (and no its not my graphics card, it can easily handle it [Amd A10-5745M Apu with Radeon]) So i deleted it and reinstalled it. It worked so i continued to play. After the turtorial, I agreed with most if not all players that the combat is EXTREMELY FUN. I was somewhat bewildered and happy with this new combat mechanic. But the fun combat cannot cover the other complaints I have. First off, the characters are really boring. Not just the npcs, but your player as well. Though a somewhat interseting backstory, it doesnt grip me enough to play on. Same with the plot. The unintersting story, just doesnt flow well.(Dont worry about spoliers, beacuse i dont even know whats the plot) Maybe its due to the fact that Ive only played the game for 3 hours, and it picks up later on, but if it does, then thats a fail for a rpg. Or any game for that matter. These flaws already is a turn down for me. Fighting makes only half of an rpg, and story and character devlopment as the other(where this game fails to achive). There are a couple of minor flaws, but I think its more of a play style prefernce. So my verdict:5/10. A decent rpg with an extremely fun fighting mechanic, but lacks in essensial rpg elements. If this were a free game, i wouldve cared less, and probably wouldve given it a positive review, but if Im BUYING an rpg game, I EXPECT an rpg game.

3020	0	a	Not a bad game for a genre clone - this wannabe fable wannabe skyrim features gnomes instead of dwarves and Fae instead of elves, but other than that mostly conforms to the tolkien rules. The 'young races,' humans (which are subdivided into skyrim-like factions), are in danger of extinction because of the 'crystal war,' where the Fae 'Tuatha' have declared war because â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ humans, I guess. The player is in the ever-imaginative position of an amnesiac who somehow has mastery of all weapon types, who wakes up as the Tuatha raid a gnommish outpost and from there I pretty much just stopped paying attention. The story is not very exciting.  The 'Destiny' system, where the player can build themselves between the three fantasy rpg classtypes (if you dont know what those are, this game would not be a great place to enter the fantasy genre), is a great idea, especially if you're a completionist and you want to see what total hybridization has to offer. The way the trees build is a little stupid though - there are like 9 types of weapons and you can put points into one weapon type at a time - if you go for full hybrid, like I did, you pretty much just suck with everything, which is what I expected. The level cap is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 40, which is GARBAGE - there are about 120 point slots for each classtype, so you can basically unlock a total THIRD of the potential of your game (I used a save editor to give myself more points because it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥). Gold is too readily available and doesn't restrict purchases at all, and the gear tries to be like diablo but it just....isn't. The looting is a little stupid. I'd give this game about a C, it captures attention at first but its flaws just rear up and are impossible to ignore. I loved tossing around chakrams and screw-attacking through people with my warrior-rogue-mage hybrid, but I got so bored I just left-clicked my way through the last third of the game.
3021	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of the most disappointing games I've played recently; not because it's bad, but because it was almost great.  It seems to me after playing it that it may have been designed to be an MMO, but was converted late in development to a basic single-player-only Action RPG, one that's very light in design depth. The action side of things is a very standard hack-and-slash set-up that would be familiar to players of anything from Zelda to God of War. However, it's marred by bad mechanics, such as mobs that rotate to follow your dodge roll and the combination of long ability cooldowns and instantaneous potion use. Rather than fight the giant bosses by blocking and dodging and using powerful spells, it's much more effective to mash attack while tapping the health potion button.  The RPG side fares worse, with talents and skills that are usually completely worthless, but punctuated with a few over the top broken abilities (such as Elemental Rage). There's also the likes of Dispel and Lockpick, which are worthless as dispelling rarely works right and lockpicking rarely fails, regardless of how many points you have. Participation in the story is just not there, apart from the tiny handful of 'Rescue Orphans or Eat Kittens' choices. (The overwhelming appearance of the yea-or-nay choice in dialogue is usually a 'But Thou Must' situation.)  On the other hand, the world, story, writing, and presentation are top-notch. (Well, apart from the 'We call Elves 'Aoeuolhffwvyr'' problem and the ripping-off-Warhammer graphics that were already old when Warcraft 3 came out.) Which brings me to the frustrating decision here. Is it worth putting up with generic, boring, poorly-designed gameplay for a fun, well-realized, and utterly huge RPG world? For my part, I say skip it. You may enjoy it, but only if you can put up with the problems above.

3025	0	a	I'd give this game a 6 out of 10, don't pick it up unless you can get it at a deep discount. A poor man's Skyrim, where the terrain is full of invisible walls. I thought having RA Salvator's name attached to it would guarrantee a dessent story line. I was proven wrong, game plays like an MMO or old school RPG. None of the quests seem to have any baring on the story line, and even though you become head of the society of mages or a king, you are still treated as a serf. Gameplay is enjoyable, I played as a mage and once you had meteor the combat became monotonous.
3026	0	a	the story is boring
3027	0	a	Kingdom of Amalur:Reckoning is a game that isn't special in any way, shape or form. At first it was designed to be an MMORPG, which shows in its world design. Sadly this design is completely uninspired, having different areas connecting awkwardly with a linear dungeon every here and then. Due to trying to be an MMORPG at first it is filled with a WoW-esque cartoony artstyle, minus the talent that was present in let's say WoW vanilla, TBC and WotLK. Even at its highest difficulty, 'hard', this is a game with zero difficulty. Primarily caused by the fact that you attack very fast, hit hard and have a great reach with most weapons. Secondarily caused by a gimmick that many games have, you, as the main character, receive some nonsense overpowered abilities that no enemy in the game can actually do anything against. So even if you somehow find an enemy that you can't stunlock in this game, you can just activate your power which slows down time and makes you hit harder to stunlock it anyways. But by all means, if you're interested in a game with a forgettable art style, boring story, combat so easy that you can hardly call it a game, poor voice acting, poor dungeon and world design, then this is the game for you.
3028	0	a	Ive just download this game and it didn;t work in the start , i pressed play and it said' a problem caused the program to stop working correctly i tried searching in google for some help but nothing happend pleasee help mee i was hoping to play this gamee coss the reviews were great
3029	0	a	My reaction? Not great...  First the technical difficulties with this game were overwhelming. The camera itself seems to have the most issues. The positioning of it is downright terrible. It really does take a lot out of the game when you have difficulty seeing the enemies or even moving efficiently. Despite it's age this has not been fixed through a patch so I was forced to download third party software in order to play the game. Next the game is actually fairly unstable. Even before I downloaded the fix it would crash frequently. It seems like the game was released too soon and then not supported. Really upsetting.  I had a lot of difficulties actually getting into this game at first. The gameplay is not very gripping even as far as RPG's go. The game also seems rather directionless. Not to mention the world you play in lacks almost all description of itself. You're required to assume things from context for a variety of the different storylines. This is especially true for the lore mechanics. I found the elves songs difficult to understand at first. Later I found out they're kind of like events that repeat themselves for some reason.  
3030	0	a	Very Bad Game!   Gameplay repetitive, story very bad, ONLY WORTH BUYING IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY OTHERS RPGs TO PLAY
3031	0	a	Â£7.99 and I'll change it to yes. Good game
3032	0	a	Unable to redefine keys.
3033	0	a	Singleplayer WoW
3034	0	a	Combat is really good, other than that its a pretty simple RPG with a lack luster story, I reccomend the Witcher 2 or 3 over this game if you are looking for both good combat and great story. In short other games can satisfy that itch better than Kingdoms of Amalur can.
3035	0	a	to be honest this is not like an offensive game, id even say its a decent game, but it has a bunch of really bad design decisions  i wont go into extensive detail, the story is nothing out of this world, its servicable at best, but thats enough, gameplay's fun enough for the first 2 hours. the main problem with the game is that it feels like they tried to make an MMO instead of an rpg. playing this game felt like i was in an empty mmo server, its really big, the quests feel like mmo quests, theres TOO MUCH TO DO, the quests mean nothing after a while because by the time youve completed a few of them you overlevel the area and theres still 10+ quests left in there. i have 18 hours in this game, i completed the main quest, hunted a few achievements and gave up when i saw that i had the dlc from the time i bought it on sale, i got everything i could get out of the game and then a bit more. in the end, the game is just a long long grind and i didnt have that much fun to begin with  if you have a lot of time to kill and dont have completionist ocd then get it, but this is just dumbed down skyrim, which is basic enough on its own.
3036	0	a	So I purchased this game around a year ago and now when I try to launch it, Origin opens and requests a key code. Inputting the Steam key does nothing. Not sure why Steam is selling games that doesn't work with Origin titles?
3037	0	a	Very poor game. There's no freedom of moving, and you can't even jump which is very, very important.
3038	0	a	Compleat Tosh!   All the worst bits of a WoW style MMO in a single player game.
3039	0	a	sad that I spent the money on this a while back. really uninspired, unengaging game. I don't even get what people like about the combat. The only redeeming quality about this game is some of the art. Stuff looks alright. That's about it.
3040	0	a	This game is obscenely huge. My guess is that it's about 3/4 size of vanilla WoW, and it kinda feels like wow. It has tons of dialogue and quests, all of which have voice over. It must have been very expensive to put this thing together.   Combat system is solid, you have to actively move around dodge or parry/block incoming attacks. There are 9 type of weapons and each type lets you perform different moves.  You can develope your character in 3 main ways (destinies). Warrior, rogue, mage or you can mix there 3 trees to your taste. But spending point in trees lets you unlock so called Twist of Fate cards which provide you additional bonuses, the more point you spent in one tree the better cards you unlock (capped at 109 points). There are cards for dualdestinies or even tripledestiny if you choose to distribute your point in all 3 trees, but point are limited so you may not have enough to get the highest tier abilities in trees. And if you build you character 'wrong' or you are bored by one playstile you can always visit a Fateweaver npc who will reset you pints, for a price.  Last but not least there is this  reckoning . It's basicly a god-mode you can activate when your  fate bar  is full, you gain fate in combat. Time slows down and you deal additional damage, your fate bar slowly drains. Whenever you defeat enemy in this mode you can perform spectacular finisher and thus gain up to 100% experince for every enemy you defeated before you chose to finish one.  It all sounds good right? Almost too good, and that is the problem. Due to game's sheer size there a high probability that you will get bored, sooner or later gameplay becomes stale. Also story isn't the best, it starts off with rpg's evergreen clichÃ©, amnesia. And honestly in the end I wasn't paying much attention so I'm not entirely what was the deal with your protagonist.  I'm not saying that there are no player who would enjoy this game from start to finish, but I'm certainly not one of them. It took me several hour to get to it, then I had fun and 40 hours later it was getting more and more boring again and I rushed through last 2 regions (Klurikon &amp; Alabastra). This game has certaily it's value it's just not that fun to play for long. Maybe it's way too big.
3041	0	a	This game sucks its all false advertising and hype I would sue for money back but i am too lazy for that
3042	0	a	Games fun and very pretty BUT despite having the system requirements and running it on lowest settings in windowed administrator mode it likes to randomly crash every single time i play it, EVERY time. makes me sad i payed for it.
3043	0	a	Bought this game after getting an itch for a new RPG. A lot of the game reminded me of Dark Souls, since the combat was pretty unforgiving and required precise timing. You cannot hack and slash your way through the game, which I liked.   However, if a game is going to be unforgiving, I am going to be the same way towards its polish. KoA has some pretty bad camera work that make timing the perfect dodge or counter attack near impossible once an enemy dashes behind you. The direction your character attacks is also subject to this issue. Spent far longer than I should have on some fights purely because the camera disagreed with me all too regularly.  The quests have the depth of your average MMO (go kill X enemy type, fetch Y item for me). I simply ran out of reasons to push forward through the game and was too frustrated by its problems.  The game also doesn't come with any options menu of any depth, if that's important to you. It feels very much like a mediocre (but not terrible) console port.  Unless you have a strong desire for a tough RPG, I would stay away. If you happen to really love those types of games, you may be able to push through the issues.
3044	0	a	The bug where the character is stuck while walking is so annoying and ruins this game. A list of known bugs before you go forward:  http://amalur.wikia.com/wiki/Bugs

3046	0	a	It's pretty decent gamplay-wise, but the quests are for the majority a load of fetch quests and such. Also apparently, this game does NOT work well with Windows 10, because it keeps crashing everytime I try to get into it. It's a time-waster really, I can't honestly reccomend it. If you DO want to get it, wait for a sale.
3047	0	a	Bought this game and couldn't even launch it. Google revealed many others with the same problem.  Not sure if this is an issue with installing it through steam or an issue with the game.

Warrior, rogue, mage or you can mix there 3 trees to your taste. But spending point in trees lets you unlock so called Twist of Fate cards which provide you additional bonuses, the more point you spent in one tree the better cards you unlock (capped at 109 points). There are cards for dualdestinies or even tripledestiny if you choose to distribute your point in all 3 trees, but point are limited so you may not have enough to get the highest tier abilities in trees. And if you build you character 'wrong' or you are bored by one playstile you can always visit a Fateweaver npc who will reset you pints, for a price.  Last but not least there is this  reckoning . It's basicly a god-mode you can activate when your  fate bar  is full, you gain fate in combat. Time slows down and you deal additional damage, your fate bar slowly drains. Whenever you defeat enemy in this mode you can perform spectacular finisher and thus gain up to 100% experince for every enemy you defeated before you chose to finish one.  It all sounds good right? Almost too good, and that is the problem. Due to game's sheer size there a high probability that you will get bored, sooner or later gameplay becomes stale. Also story isn't the best, it starts off with rpg's evergreen clichÃ©, amnesia. And honestly in the end I wasn't paying much attention so I'm not entirely what was the deal with your protagonist.  I'm not saying that there are no player who would enjoy this game from start to finish, but I'm certainly not one of them. It took me several hour to get to it, then I had fun and 40 hours later it was getting more and more boring again and I rushed through last 2 regions (Klurikon &amp; Alabastra). This game has certaily it's value it's just not that fun to play for long. Maybe it's way too big.
3055	0	a	This game sucks its all false advertising and hype I would sue for money back but i am too lazy for that
3056	0	a	Games fun and very pretty BUT despite having the system requirements and running it on lowest settings in windowed administrator mode it likes to randomly crash every single time i play it, EVERY time. makes me sad i payed for it.
3057	0	a	Bought this game after getting an itch for a new RPG. A lot of the game reminded me of Dark Souls, since the combat was pretty unforgiving and required precise timing. You cannot hack and slash your way through the game, which I liked.   However, if a game is going to be unforgiving, I am going to be the same way towards its polish. KoA has some pretty bad camera work that make timing the perfect dodge or counter attack near impossible once an enemy dashes behind you. The direction your character attacks is also subject to this issue. Spent far longer than I should have on some fights purely because the camera disagreed with me all too regularly.  The quests have the depth of your average MMO (go kill X enemy type, fetch Y item for me). I simply ran out of reasons to push forward through the game and was too frustrated by its problems.  The game also doesn't come with any options menu of any depth, if that's important to you. It feels very much like a mediocre (but not terrible) console port.  Unless you have a strong desire for a tough RPG, I would stay away. If you happen to really love those types of games, you may be able to push through the issues.
3058	0	a	I want to like this but the camera is just plain awful. When you aren't in combat it's too close to the character so that you can't see a thing going on around you, and when you are in combat it tries to zoom out to give you a good perspective but often your character will just go off the screen. Often in the game I was just spamming buttons because I couldn't even see myself or the enemies. It's terrible at following the character and hard to put up with for a game that has hundreds of hours it expects me to sit through.
3059	0	a	I was only able to play 26 hours of this game before i uninstalled it. I really tried to get into it, but there are a few things that just really got on my nerves me and makes it unenjoyable.   My main issue with it is the camera. You are stuck looking directly over the shoulder of the character with no way to zoom out and its extremely frustrating. I like to have the control to zoom out further and this honestly seems like such a simple fix, I am surprised that it hasnt been included in the game yet through some patch. I guess developers don't care. maybe it was because they didnt spend much time on the maps and you would be zooming through objects, i dunno.  I tried the widescreenfix program on many different settings and to get zoomed out to the point I enjoy it around 100-110 degrees, the image is so fisheyed and distorted. That and it has issues phasing have to constantly keep resetting it with the hotkey etc. Honestly, just comes down to the fact that the majority of my gameplay seems to be focused on getting a nice camera vantage and less about the game itself. The widescreenfix is really not meant for this, its meant more for spreading games out onto multiple displays. The fix should of been implemented by the developers and seeing that people have been complaining about this since it's release, that's just disappointing.  I was not drawn into the story. Seems like a cool premise, but the quests are rather boring and the landscape and dungeons honestly start to feel the same, I've cleared the majority of the western map, including its dungeons now and there's different textures and what not, but I feel like i'm just running down a tunnel everywhere i go. I have no issue with linear maps, dragon age was a great example of how linear maps can still be done right, but these are just dull. I just didn't feel attached to the lore and the world.   Combat is kinda cool. Similar to guildwars 2 in that you get different attacks based on weapons. Spells come from talents. I enjoyed the combat.  Fast travel system is nice, but there are still some dungeons that are really large and you can't fast travel from within them, so you must run to the exit. Spend 5-10 min doing that some times. meh  might be good for some, but honestly I just uninstalled it cuz of the camera. That seriously killed it for me. Fans probably can turn a cheek to it.
3060	0	a	it's an MMO without the other people.
3061	0	a	needs playable â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ race
3062	0	a	I put WAY too much time into this game. Completing the main plot, and almost every quest midway though the world. There is certainly a lot to this game, and it seems to check all the boxes for a good RPG. However it's repetitive combat, forgettable gear, and MEH story will stop being fun long before the game is even close to ending. I only beat it so that it didn't beat me. If you must play this game, don't bother getting sidetracked, just hack away and hope you get to the end before what fun can be had wears thin.
3063	0	a	I really wanted to like this game,but there are just to many flaws for it to be good.  Textures that overlap, feet that go through the ground. Plus the fact you cant zoom the camera out or change your FoV but during combat sometimes the camera will swing way out and then back in for no apperent reason. The game has interface lag. And even with all the eye candy turned on this game really doesnt look that great(in context for the year it came out). It reminds me of WoW which isnt saying much. The story is somewhat interesting but the side quests are boring and some are downright tedious. The combat system has potential to but is let down by a poorly thought out skill system and all the other issues I previously mentioned.  Its to bad. The game has a ton of potential, but in typical EA style , it feels like a cheap take on a great idea. A game is rushed out ASAP with no concern for being above average.
3064	0	a	The story is BORING, which is surprising because of all the fantasy writers attached to it. Too many cooks in the kitchen? I didn't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about my character or anyone else. The combat is cool but SO easy. You basically button mash and auto target. The world is huge and pretty which is probably the games redeeming factor. If you are a side quest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you will be in heaven.
3065	0	a	this game is is the dumbest thing on earth
3066	0	a	I had been looking forward to playing Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning for quite some time. The action-RPG style was very appealing as most combat in this genre is point-and-click clunkiness.   To my initially great pleasure, the combat was just as I expected, similar to Darksiders but as I played further, I found it to be very boring and repetitive. The same attack sequences, the same types of enemies, the same thing... over and over. So while the combat was good to start, it failed to hold my interest in the long run... even after unlocking the full tree.  The stories (main and side) of KoA are extremely bland. Only towards the very end did the main story line get somewhat interesting then it felt completely rushed and overlooked in the interest of ending the story. If you play RPGs for a deep story, you will not find it here.  I was very disappointed to find a level cap of 40. If you most of the side quests, you will hit this well before the end-game. Sure you can respec any try a different playstyle or character build but in the end, you will still be maxed at 40 which truly only allows for one specialization.  The amazing choice/consequence of alternative games was non-existent in KoA. You have dialogue options but none that really affect the story or outcome... so while the game says you decide your fate, this is hardly the case.  Graphically, the game looked decent. Some of the textures (especially grass) looked awful but it ran very smoothly. Music was good and very fitting.  The crafting aspect allows you to create any kind of weapon/amor you want. This is a pretty nice feature as it does allow you to customize gear according to your playstyle.  On the plus side, the DLC (Teeth of Naros and Dead Kel) were both excellent. They are fully developed and not quick to complete. Both were definitely worth the extra money.  Overall, I was disappointed with KoA. The repetitive nature and linear choice/story made for a bland experience. My rating is 6.5/10.
3067	0	a	I tried to get into it, I really did, but it just feels... wrong. I've heard before that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning was a failed attempt at an MMO and I'm afraid it shows. Between monsters constantly spawning up and quests being largely inconsequential I can't help but feel I'm playing a single player MMO. The combat is obviously what is going to bring in most people and it is entertaining but it gets really old really quick. As if that isn't bad enough the level up system follows that bad system that keeps getting thrown around where you only buff up a few things by a couple percents for every point *cough*Borderlands*cough*. I don't give a damn if I now have 3% to crit as opposed to 2.5%, I want to feel like that 1 point can completely change my character. Instead of busting out an abacus to figure out which percent is better to raise I should be able to tilt my head back and ask myself 'How do I wanna â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up today?'.  tl;dr it's a failed attempt at an rpg, give it a pass unless it's on a huge sale and the combat really grabs you
3068	0	a	It seems to be a songle player MMO, while it does have good stories and intracate plot line, that is it. Combat is sub-par and the advancement system is very confusing.
3069	0	a	Not worth the time or money, the type of game it is limits every choice you can make and confines you to the typical three class system. There is no mix 'n' matching between classes or armor/weapon choices.  In short this game is junk.
3070	0	a	Plays like an original playstation game with 2008 graphics. Terrible story, cheesy, bad 'one button mash' combat.
3071	0	a	FOV patch needed in order for this game to playable.
3072	0	a	This is an absolutely fabulous unplayable game. If it weren't for the fact that my character suddenly began freezing in place every few steps, requiring that I jiggle the mouse or let up and press down the forward key to get him moving again, I'd be recommending this game to everyone I know. Great combat, pretty graphics, awesome lore ... I just can't play it, is all. Most of your play time is spent walking, exploring, travelling ... it's impossible to enjoy that when you have to button-mash to do it! I've tried all the fixes I could find, and nothing helps. Thank God it was on sale. I'd be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ instead of disappointed if I had paid more than I did.

3080	0	a	This is a pretty long game with good voice acting and story for the main quest line, but outside of the quest cutscenes most of that time is spent doing unfun things. Travelling, fighting, looting and mini games all are just not done well compared to many other games.  The fighting is way too easy to be any sort of fun and when your character is hit you stagger which interrupts any sort of flow. If an enemy does manage to hurt you, instant use health potions make it impossible to ever die in this game. Enemies popping out of the ground constantly is annoying and you may quickly find you get sick of it all and just run past as much as you possibly can. If you ever get into a tough fight, you have an *I win* slow-mo mode that also gives you bonus XP for using.  The looting is crazy, with chests littered all over the place. You'll quickly fill your backpack with loads of vendor trash to accumulate useless gold with. On top of that your armor takes damage for no apparant reason so you will have to go back to town to get repairs.  Inventory management is a pain with the massive piles of loot you get, which isn't helped by the fact that there are a billion different slight variations of potions you'll never use because the fights are so easy. Also many quest items are bugged and will permanently suck up your inventory space, yuck.  The minigames are just dumb time wasters. There are two to unlock chests, the lockpicking mostly is just holding a key down and waiting as the default position will unlock a chest most of the time. The dispelling of a chest is slightly more interesting but quickly becomes tiresome on the far far too common chests.  Outside of the main quest line and faction quests, which are good, there isn't a lot of variety with most being go to spot X on the map and kill a bunch of things and come back. The pirate DLC quest series is a standout and if you do decide to get this game (don't) and make it to Rathir then pick up the 'Legend' DLC as it is as good if not better than the main game.  This could have been a pretty awesome game with some tweaking but the good bits are buried under way too much tiresome muck you need to shovel through.
3081	0	a	I play for ten minutes and it shuts off!! wtf!!
3082	0	a	Meh. Just a bit typical.
3083	0	a	Edit. Worth it for Â£5   Well, I cant really recommend this game, reason being is that it doesn't seem to engage you as much as you would like. At full price this game seems to be worth it at first but i however, lost interest about 9 hours in, you might think 9 hours thats quite engaging. Not for a game this large. The games storyline is one that is quite typical, bad guys trying to gain power and all that, i started skipping conversations with characters about 2 hours in as i thought my time was being wasted as the story wasn't thrilling, and there didn't seem to be any backbone behind it all. Combat wise its a very good game, i played a rogue type character and enjoyed most of the combat, however the enemies do seem to be repetitively used in certain areas. With no variety of enemies, you found yourself using the same tactics multiple times just because they were most effective. Its a slick game that has great combat elements and a broad choice of combat styles but its not entertaining enough to keep you in
3084	0	a	Very buggy! Buy with Caution!
3085	0	a	Skyrim for 12 yr old.  Good: Graphics Fighting mechanics Game controllers support is amazing (Playing with 360 controller is better, than keyboard)  Ok: Storyline Open world with side quests and frations  Bad: Looting, inventory and selling/buying stuff. Absolute headache.  Leveling and skills. Need to check from 3 different menus what to level up.  The game is quite easy, interesting if you haven't played Elder Scrolls series or other Open World RPG. No gore or whatsoever.
3086	0	a	I ALMOST recommend this game with strong reservations. If you can find it cheap, it's a good way to waste a few hours. The accent here is on waste, though.   It's not particularly fun after the first few hours and you quickly realize it's all exactly the same. Once you get higher level, there's... nothing. There's no THERE there. The game is incredibly shallow. There are a number of very enjoyable elements:  Character customization Action-combat Well-flushed, if very vanilla, world Crafting system is an excellent idea, if badly implemented in late game  The problem is that the game is entirely too large. It should have either been much shorter or had a much larger variety in the mechanics. Once you get high level the whole thing's BORING. You cakewalk through quest after quest and get the same unhelpful rewards. The 'oh boy I found the next tier of gear' effect is quickly lost and the entire thing just gets old. Money quickly becomes a waste when you're making all your own gear based on what you loot off monsters.  Basically, the whole game is very unimaginative. I know now why it didn't sell as well as the developers needed it to. It's just meh.  TLDR: 6.5/10 - Starts out great and quickly becomes dull.
3087	0	a	So I purchased this game around a year ago and now when I try to launch it, Origin opens and requests a key code. Inputting the Steam key does nothing. Not sure why Steam is selling games that doesn't work with Origin titles?
3088	0	a	Very poor game. There's no freedom of moving, and you can't even jump which is very, very important.
3089	0	a	Compleat Tosh!   All the worst bits of a WoW style MMO in a single player game.
3090	0	a	sad that I spent the money on this a while back. really uninspired, unengaging game. I don't even get what people like about the combat. The only redeeming quality about this game is some of the art. Stuff looks alright. That's about it.
3091	0	a	This game is obscenely huge. My guess is that it's about 3/4 size of vanilla WoW, and it kinda feels like wow. It has tons of dialogue and quests, all of which have voice over.

3092	0	a	For people who likes lots of grinding, lots of items and lots of quest which most are boring it's the place to go.  For people who like to be surprised while questing -&gt; this is not game for you.   If you want to play it try to not do all side quests which most are boring and you must make sure you play hard difficulty.
3093	0	a	long and monotonous. it's like a single player WoW, which i thought was great at first. but the world's too large and empty. tons of pointless quests, which i abaondoned doing about 10 hours in. story's genaric.  pro- really nice to look at  2 out of 5 stars.

3102	0	a	Combat is really good, other than that its a pretty simple RPG with a lack luster story, I reccomend the Witcher 2 or 3 over this game if you are looking for both good combat and great story. In short other games can satisfy that itch better than Kingdoms of Amalur can.
3103	0	a	to be honest this is not like an offensive game, id even say its a decent game, but it has a bunch of really bad design decisions  i wont go into extensive detail, the story is nothing out of this world, its servicable at best, but thats enough, gameplay's fun enough for the first 2 hours. the main problem with the game is that it feels like they tried to make an MMO instead of an rpg. playing this game felt like i was in an empty mmo server, its really big, the quests feel like mmo quests, theres TOO MUCH TO DO, the quests mean nothing after a while because by the time youve completed a few of them you overlevel the area and theres still 10+ quests left in there. i have 18 hours in this game, i completed the main quest, hunted a few achievements and gave up when i saw that i had the dlc from the time i bought it on sale, i got everything i could get out of the game and then a bit more. in the end, the game is just a long long grind and i didnt have that much fun to begin with  if you have a lot of time to kill and dont have completionist ocd then get it, but this is just dumbed down skyrim, which is basic enough on its own.
3104	0	a	So I purchased this game around a year ago and now when I try to launch it, Origin opens and requests a key code. Inputting the Steam key does nothing. Not sure why Steam is selling games that doesn't work with Origin titles?

3106	0	a	#not impressed. GAME IS NOTHING LIKE FABLE - many people claimed that this was a game very similar to Fable. However they forget to mention its nothing like fable. Fable is a very richly created game with in depth areas to explore. This game however feels like alot less than that. It feels like Fable to some people because it mirrors or copies all of Fable the originals strengths. Yet again it doesnt improve anything. It actually takes away a lot of the fun nods that Fables combat offers. This game is for the faint at heart. Those that want to quickly smash through levels and complete a game. It is not for those that want a rich story with fun combat that never gets old. This combat system is way to simple. Fable series is better off witout any of this dont believe the myths that this game is somehow a lost link to Fable. Decent game but not anywhere near the hype.

3108	0	a	Up until the game locked up and now will not load again it was --OK. Don't wast your money. There are two end boss fights that can bugg out and cuse the game to crash and not wrok again. EA scrwes up another game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3109	0	a	I realize that I played through this entire game and its DLCs and even went so far as to get 100% of the achievements, but I just cannot recommend it. It's not all negative, it's just... boring.   And it shouldn't be. The environments should be mind blowing. The character design should be good. The weapons and armor designs should be interesting. But, they just... aren't. They are by themselves out of context. The screenshots and such for this game make it look really interesting and captivating. But when you are playing, everything is really bland text-book fantasy cliche and so all these things that look really nice out of context become dull and boring when put together as a whole in the context of the game.   Also, the crafting system sucks and doesn't seem to make any weapons or armor better than what you can find in the game. Also, the random loot system sucks: you find a piece of a named armor set, but by the time you randomly get all of the pieces or even enough for it's cumulative effects to be useful, you've leveled up way beyond it and have found generic armor beyond its capabilities. And, I'm not sure if it is possible to make sidequests any more generic, boring, and repetitive.   The gameplay itself and combat are fine, I guess.   So, bad crafting, bad loot, extremely meh gameplay, nothing special combat, and incredibly dull cliche story and characters make this game just plain boring. If you are looking for a fantasy world to explore, you'd be much better of going and wandering around Skyrim again.

3111	0	a	Game breaking bug in the main quest. Awesome. Wow.
3112	0	a	I would like to give this game a positive review. For all the good points, please go read any of the many positive reviews. I agree with most the other reviewers' points concerning sound, combat, UI, etc. There are two reasons this gets a thumbs down from me. 1) Remapping keys doesn't work. Well, it does, sort of. You can add new keys to binds, but you can't remove the old ones. The default key bindings don't go away when you make new binds, and there's no way I've found to fix that, and if you bind a new function to a default-bound key, you get the default bind plus the new bind. EG, by default SHIFT is used for blocking. If you bind sprint to SHIFT, it will now block and sprint, mutually exclusive functions since you can't move while blocking. Yeesh. And yeah, 'block' is on the SHIFT key and sprint is on the CTRL key. Double yeesh. You know what games use SHIFT for sprint? EVERY OTHER @#$% GAME EVER MADE. Fortunately you can use a controler, which is the option I went with, rather than messing with decades of muscle memory. The second reason I'm thumbs-downing this game is because, on Windows 10, on certain boxes, it crashes to desktop randomly and without warning. A search of the net led me to a horde of disappointed gamers with the same issue. The usual tricks, running in compatibility mode, disconecting peripherals (the game goes loopy if you've got a graphics tablet plugged in) didn't help me, and since the devs are no longer, there will be no patches. I'd hoped, in vain, for a 3rd party patch, but couldn't find one. From what I have seen during my anywhere-from-five-minutes-to-an-hour-before-crashing game sessions, the game looks great. It would be nice if it was playable.
3113	0	a	Do not buy even if its on sale for a dollar! This game has silly cartoon graphics and is NOT open world. It is the worst game I have ever bought even for 4.99.   1. Not open world 2.Nothing to explore 3. Cartoon graphics   BUY SKYRIM NOT THIS GAME. While it may not seem fair to compare the game to skyrim the reason I do is because of how they portray the game when the describe it.  1. They decide to throw in a name from the Elder Scrolls 4. 2. on Steam this game is listed under 'similar games to skyrim or oblivion 3.There is no massive open world. In combat it basically closes you off into a small area of the map thats where I lost the open world part. 4.The graphics are not just differnt their pretty bad even for an older game  Below I have how they described the game.

3114	0	a	Good game,   but need keyboard+mouse or 360 pad instead of a third party controller like x360ce.   
3115	0	a	There is a game breaking bug that they know about and never patched. I knew it was an EA title and figured it couldn't possibly be a waste of money for six bucks. I was wrong. set your money on fire instead.
3116	0	a	Worst 10.3 hours of my life, The game just got more lame the longer i played until i couldnt stant it anymore.
3117	0	a	This game did not work for me. Constant freezing and stuttering, was basically unplayable. I know that this is a decent game but cannot recommend...I am reviewing this simply to warn those may consider purchasing it in the future. By the way, my system runs high end games perfectly, such as Doom, The Witcher 3, The Divison, etc...so my rig is not the problem.
3118	0	a	Camera movement are very sloppy but combat is good not worth buying the full price so...6.5/10
3119	0	a	Sorry, but I can not reccomend this. While it has potentaial, ultimately it was too much like on offline MMO, just tons of fetch quests. Also there are TONS of bugs that will never get fixed since the studio went bankrupy.
3120	0	a	I don't know exactly why the three hours I played this game felt like three weeks, but it did, and it wasn't fun. It might be the MMO world which de-emphasizes any build-up to an interest in the story, or it might be that most of the NPCs have a large list of pointless conversation pieces telling me the exact same thing that another NPC just told me (none of which matter or are interesting). It might also be because when they introduce an NPC with some amount of potential, like Agarth, he just sends me on an errand and sits back. I do know that some degree of the not-fun has to do with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Skyrim-esque skills, which are neither fun nor intuitive - I'd rather not put points in lockpick because I'd rather never have to do it. Also, how do you farm an herb and get zero materials? Am I eating the plants as I'm farming them? Am I farming them with a flamethrower and rendering them unusable? Talk about unsatisfying.  Either way, the game emphasized all the negative aspects of an MMO - grinding and pointless fighting, uninspired dungeon design (because, again, it is endless hack and slash, not anything inventive), a story that felt both non-urgent and uninteresting, and a host of mini-game mechanics, like a dumbed down lockpicking mechanic, that make the game more laborious than fun.  If you wanna play an MMO, just choose one of the free ones with an interesting story or mechanics (at least in an MMO I have abilities to spice up combat). There just isn't much reason to play this compared to what else is out there.
3121	0	a	combat is broken as hell and the game itself is boring after the first time around, pretty bad replay ability. Combat is absolutely by far the worst element of this game however, since every monster attack will interrupt anything you are doing, and the block/dodge functions are clunky. Mad or naw, Mad
3122	0	a	My sister bought me this game on the promise that I would stop cutting off her fingers. However, I found it to be lacking in the areas of gameplay, graphics, story, characters, abilities, main menu, launchability, and accessibility. Having no arms myself, I found it very difficult to play this game and especially to write this review. 10/10 would never play again.
3123	0	a	This game was really fun for the firs ten hours or so. But by then you've got the combat system down and pretty much nothing can touch you. (I played on maximum difficulty level.)  Then you discover to your horror that there's about 100 hours worth of game in here if you're stupid enough to chase down all the sidequests (like me.). This has the honor of being the first open world RPG I played where I started hammering X to skip the dialogue, and I played NWN2 all the way through. None of the characters are interesting or likable, and the bearded elves are intensely boring people. They're also the ones with the most lines.  Buy it only if it's under 5 dollars so you can enjoy those first ten hours I mentioned.
3124	0	a	It's like leveling up in an MMO for the 100th time. Only with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ier loot.
3125	0	a	Do not waste money , game have some major gameplaying issuses (for example you enter DLC teeth of narros , do all the quests , but since fast travel not working (broken!) and entrance you came in is blocked , you cant return to mainland ) ... for me that was 35+ hours of wasted time.
3126	0	a	This game looked decent in the videos/reviews and I wanted to play a game of this type, so I gave it a shot. I was unimpressed. It quickly became work to learn the game mechanics and specifics as it was so boring and not fun. I did not like the game play or story. Skip.
3127	0	a	A very un-original story, and gameplay matched up with one of the worst cameras I have ever seen. It didn't take long for me to give up on this title.
3128	0	a	Put Oblivion, World of Warcraft, Fable and Diablo in a blender. Then fund that blender with the entire state budget of Rhode Island and have Todd McFarlane dribble concept art into it while RA Salvatore dances around chanting 'think of Drizzt, think of Drizzt, think of Drizzt' and Curt Schilling, MLB hall of fame runner-up, stares on from his golden throne, his fingertips idly playing across the seam on a long-forgotten mitt. Under his breath, he murmurs:  'King Arthur would've played shortstop. King Arthur...King Arthur. Hrm.'  The baseball whips form his hand at an intern, who cries 'WHAT DO YOU ASK OF ME, SIRE,' voice tinged with the kind of desperate fear known only by a coder living out of his car.  'Fetch quests. Fetch me...fetch quests.'  Across the way, a beta tester buries her face in her hands and weeps. No one will ever sing her song.  Amalur stands silent in her memory.
3129	0	a	Crappy â™¥â™¥â™¥ consol port. lousy controls, lousy movement, lousy fighting, and about gave me convultions with the high speed movement. Wouldn't be so bad if you could zoom out, but no stuck about 3 feet behind your character so you can't see crap. Don't spend a dime on this crappy game.
3130	0	a	First off, the 6 hours on record would constitute my second time attempting to like this game, after about 15 spent a year of so back. Sadly, it's another failed attempt.   The game has a lot of quests, loot, crafting, decent combat and a very rich world, with extensive lore. Then why do I always feel bored 30 minutes into a play session? Mostly because it feels like someone took a generic MMORPG and tried to make a single player game out of it.  - The crafting feels useless, just a time sink. - The abilities, skills also feel useless, since your character grows in strength mostly due to changing equipment. - The open world feels empty - I felt like looking at one of those driving scenes in old movies with bad background work. The images change but you know they're not real. At some point pretending to use the steering wheel becomes pointless. - The rich world filled with lore I mentioned above? Completely boring and bland. For all the dialog available, I found myself skipping through it, realizing that I would forget it anyway 2 minutes after the conversation ended. - There was some thought put into enemy design, you will encounter very different types. Too bad the AI is truly poor, and you can literally go through them by button mashing away.  The only slightly redeeming quality is the combat, as it offers you plenty of options in killing those forgettable enemies I mentioned.  Overall, you might enjoy this to pass a bit of time, but it's definitely not worth going through the whole story. It's only the illusion of a fully realized RPG, and it's all downhill once that becomes apparent.
3131	0	a	4/10  This game has so much potential. I did enjoy the first couple of hours as I played it. But there are way to many side quest which makes it feel like the game progress really slowly. Which in turn makes it feel very repetative. The combat is rather one dimentional, it gets a bit better by the fact that you have a main and a secondary weapon. Also there varaity of enemys isnt that great either. For me it felt like much of the later fights was me avoiding getting hit couse every little hit staggered me so I couldnt attack and then pop in hits when there where openings. Perhaps its better if you use a quicker weapon and not a greatsword like I did. And talking about greatswords it felt like it droped alot fewer of them then of every other weapon. Well atleast compaired to longswords and hammers which I found plenty. I know I should have crafted a good greatsword. But then the entire loot system gets pretty boring as I can just craft the best gear. For the crafting to have been more fun there should have been rare crafting materials and that way not making looting boring.  I think it is worth giving the game a try. If you like the combat more then I did you will probably want to do side missions and let the game progress slower. Me on the other hand stoped doing side missions after a while and just got through the main story.  With a few changes this game could have been awesome. I think the world feels rather liniar even if its open. There should have a mount or similar for when you need to run a long distance (once you visited a place you can fast travel to it, and fast travel I did alot). The trainer system should have been made more clear. Lock picking needs a bit of tweaking, now its rediculusly easy (I didnt put one point into the skill and still I picked very hard locks only loosing 2-3 picks). Well in the end I do hope they will make a sequal which has a bunch of changes for the better.

3133	0	a	This game starts out great! Then becomes repetitive and a total drag. The DLC is terrible and the gear apparently scales with the time you downloaded the DLC... it does not scale with you character's actual level. Ridiculuous. Not recommending it. But dissapointed because it could have been a great game. The combat is solid.
3134	0	a	Game is not at all very fun.

3138	0	a	I wasn't sure if to recommend it or not but in the end this game is a no for me. It is an offline mmorpg structured to farm quest over quest with bland stories and the usual pick this and bring it there. The music is nice, the voice acting too and the graphic is enjoyable to watch with all the light effects of the skills. The pro of this game is the combat and skills that are really well made. The camera is the worst and you can pass by a treasure without even finding it. It is hard to go on with the game and it will probably be one of the few that i will never finish.
3139	0	a	The game dont' work! After 20 min of gameplay i'm stuck in to a dialogue and the game don't go forward! DON'T BUY THIS GAME! IT'S ALL BUGGED!
3140	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is not a *bad* game, but I cannot recommend it. It plays like a solo version of World of Warcraft, with better combat and so so many fluff FedEx and Kill X of Y quests that WoW might be embarrassed. The camera is also much to close on PC and seems to have a mind of its own. After having played it nearly 12 hours, I just couldn't find a reason to keep on going. It's bland, ponderous, and there are too many better games to waste time on a mediocre one.
3141	0	a	Not a great PC port, seems like it has consolitus.
3142	0	a	Big Huge Games should change their name to Big Huge Empty Games. The game played amazing for the first two hours, but then quickly devolved into feeling like a cheap mmo with no people. The world was artistically baren with an extra drought for interest. Repetitive enemies, boss fights, NPC's, side-quests, scenery, etc. cripple this game beyond redemption, not to mention the extensive overuse of particle effects and vasalensing. This game is all hype and no substance. Recommended alternative: Darksiders, which uses the same game engine and peripherals, but has so, so much more to offer. And if you've already played it, play it again.
3143	0	a	This is a horribly overrated game, and it has no value aside from a vast world and semi-legit voice acting. If you're looking for a single player game of the same quality as a free-to-play MMORPG, then you may enjoy this, other than that - don't waste your time and money.  Combat and movement mechanics are horrid: if you're standing on a hill - your attacks go perpedicular to your character, so if an enemy is right in front of you and you're theoretically targetting them - your projectiles go right above their heads (or into the hill at their feet, if you're below them). There doesn't appear to be a way to cancel your long-charge combo attacks, so if you see a new enemy jump out from the side of the screen while in the middle of a combo - you're screwed, forced to just sit there and helplessly watch yourself getting hit. The game is completely 2D as far as the movement plane goes, there is no jumping aside from a few designated spots (with a special animation). Smallest rocks on the ground have huge collision boxes, making you walk all the way around them instead of over them, (and i'm not exaggerating - some of those rocks are maybe 3 inches tall, it is incredibly dumb that your character constantly gets stuck on them trying to walk past.). Leveling-up mechanics (skill and ability trees) and inventory management are pretty much straight from Dragon Age (and i'm sure a bunch of other much older games, but Dragon Age is the first one that comes to mind), so nothing original or unique there. I'm not exactly criticizing re-using old techniques, but just emphasizing the fact that there isn't anything ground-breaking which would make up for all the bad things. Graphics are at a World of Warcraft level. Considering how old WoW is, i'm sure that says a lot. And to top it all there are game-breaking bugs that there is no way to get around, aside from reloading a much ealier save game at the beginning of a quest line and trying again (hoping the bug won't happen again). I would have even forgiven not being able to complete that particular quest and just moving on to others, but this game didn't even let me do that - i was just stuck in one place with no ability to go anywhere. Overall - really badly made game. A 6 out of 10 at most. And if it wasn't for the slightly-above-mediocre art/music/writing, i wouldn't have given it more than 4 ouf of 10.
3144	0	a	Games like this should come with a warning: WARNING: This is not a grown-up game. This is a port of a kiddie-console game. Graphics and gameplay will suck.

3151	0	a	great combat bland world so so game find a diffrent time sink
3152	0	a	This game is horrible and boring. It's so boring that I skipped half the quest story details. Same old same old. Go here, do this. Come back and get your reward. Combat is the worst. The combat is so slow that you can't even apply your shield. There's like a 1 second delay after attacking in which time the enemy is already attacking. The magic abilities are all pathetic. They do around 10 damage which doesn't even register on the enemies health bar.
3153	0	a	the game is good but the coding is awful its a buggy mess such a shame because it showed promise after the first 30 lvls into the game but now i can't start the damn game it crashes before it starts and now i have to fix it myself.  buy it with a discount and that's only if you are curious about what it has to offer other than that don't bother

3155	0	a	I had a quest: Go to some witch in the woods and get a potion for dying someone. Well the potion could have been purchased from merchant next door instead. And this game is full of brilliant quests like that!  Pros:  - Some impressive combat system. You do really feel powerful with your big, fancy sword. - Items and levelling system were alright - World looks okay  Cons: - Shallowness of entire game. - Plastic dialogues - Dull quests - Mediocre graphics - Boring gameplay (except for combat)  My rating: 2.50/10

3164	0	a	As someone who bought KoA during the sale, allow me to say that Skyrim is the better game in almost every respect. KoA had a combat system that's more fun at first, but it's obviously way too easy and suffers from a real lack of breadth in terms of options in the early levels. Every enemy I encounter I've tackled the same way. Frankly, I'd rather be stealth sniping enemies in Skyrim at this point.  What's unforgivable is just how soulless the game is. The NPCs say a lot, but no one has anything to say, if that makes sense. There's not a memorable character thus far, and it has a naming scheme cunningly designed to ensure you forget everything immediately. I run from objective to objective, but I'm not invested at all, there's just no reason to care. MMO in single-player form is what I've seen it called, and apart from a much more player skill orientated combat system, this seems spot on.
3165	0	a	This game really isn't that great, I mean the combat it fun, but thats about it. Everything else is just meh.
3166	0	a	The mechanics are quite good but there's a distinct lack of variety to the combat.
3167	0	a	after around 30 hours of gameplay i came across a game breaking glitch. the quest her rightous fury stops you from fast traveling. which makes getting supplies or doing quests a very big pain. i literally have no will to finish this by running everywhere with a map that isnt exactly small. if only i looked this up i would of avoided this. but then again i thought a game this old would at least have its glithes fixed! im so disappointed and very upset cause i was looking forward to playing this game for a while
3168	0	a	This game is boring.
3169	0	a	It's like macaroni and cheese without the cheese. It's serviceable, but bland and leaves you feeling empty.
3170	0	a	The game is beautiful; the money spent on acting and emoting is top notch. Unfortunately, its just boring. If you like a seek and find adventure where you are put into a whole new story this is your game. If you are wanting something that hooks you and drives your character to go and do things you may want to look elsewhere.
3171	0	a	This game seemed to strive for the depth characteristic of the Elder Scrolls games, but it came off as cheap and simple. The story was forgettable and most of the characters were as well. The combat was entertaining up until I hit my level cap, then it was nothing more than an annoyance as enemies were no longer the slightest bit challenging. Even the final boss was simple to defeat while losing no more than maybe 10% of my health. I hit my level cap roughly half-way through my playtime (120 hours, including Dead Kel and Teeth of Naros DLC).  The biggest annoyance was the lockpicking. The controls are not fined-tuned at all, so it's nearly impossible to pick with actual skill, even when working on a lowest level lock with a fully leveled lockpicking skill. The auto-picking uses up a lockpick, even if your skill grants you a 100% chance of succeeding. Unforunately, you don't find enough lockpicks to go auto-picking everything unless you purchase lockpicks at every opportunity.
3172	0	a	To me it plays like an MMO without all the other players
3173	0	a	From content standpoint this game likely merits a 90/100 score. its big it has a lot of stuff and quest and tons of voice acting everywhere, the artist are very creative, and it looks good, the game engine is suitably powerful and technically better than its competitor Divinity 2. its a very playable game. But...  ...I did not really enjoy playing it. I played about 92 hours, so its very playable or I wouldn't waste 1 hour with it. For I have no reason except the enjoyment of the experience (there may be some other reasons... but thats mainly what one plays a game for).  The main story isn't all that great. I never felt drawn into the lavish story line. The character are all meaningless, one never ever cares anything for any of them. I think the literary elements are destroyed by the open ended questing system (I would have closed the questing system so it must be played in a certain order. This would have helped much to draw people in to the experience). There is never any sense that anything matters at all anywhere in the world.  The inventory and character management system works, but I would say a patch should have fixed its crudeness. It should have been easy for such skilled developers to polish this system as it's so important to any game of any genre.  But my number one gripe by far for this game is the camera. I just don't want to play it anymore because I am sick to death of staring at my characters backside while I play. The camera is just terrible. All one ever does when playing is stare at the ground and at your characters backside. This should have been fixed immediately. It is the easiest thing to fix. Divinity 2 does a much much much better job with the camera. Though Skyrim V is the best and most popular of the genre I think. These sort of games need a first person perspective. The camera view is half the game.  There are other things too of course. But my other serious issues pertain to genre and game development descisions on a broader level, so to say, these sorts of problem are simply the norm right now. So I won't bother talking about them. I'll try to judge this game against its competitors, not because I have too but because I want too. If a developer reads this, -----------------FIX THE CAMERA!--------------------   The quest camera which locks the camera onto the face of NPC's whenever there is something to talk about in the game is also annoying, and would be better if it was more semi-iso-metric. The NPC's faces look stupid and wooden and I hate looking at them. I want to throw rocks at them and poke them with sharp things while they speak.   Games have always been stupid, idiotic non-sensical rubbish. One of the greatest in history involved single handly traveling to hell, completely alone, wading through hordes of incredible murderous demons. For a bunny rabbit... Literally...  I think this game takes itself wayyyyyyyy too seriously. For the level of literary wit it possesses. It wants to be super great and legendary, but its just isn't.... Its obvious the developers don't know much about anything, its just money, and that what they needed to remember in there case. They just want to make money and care nothing about all these extremely serious issues they talk about, that have nothing to do with money at all. In other words it would have been smarter to go more stupid rather than try elevate the genre up to a level serious literature. Why doesn't our hero just chase some â™¥â™¥â™¥ into hell for all it matters. That would work much better.  Is it possible to create a game masterpiece? Will the game world one day have its truly great playwright(s)? Probably. But Kingdoms of Amalur deffinately ain't it.  I talk like this because there is a whole lot of talking and acting in this game and a huge heavey duty ultra-serious life and death and the meaning of everything and more than that too - plot in the game. Which is why I mention playwrights, and am refering to high quality richly respected writers in general. There is a real desire in the game that is obvious, to raise the medium of gaming out of its non-sensical idiot past, and make something really great. But in my opinion this effort eats turf.   I give this game a 60/100  Bottomline: if the developers fix the camera I would say one can have fun playing this amusing bit of rubbish. Theres tons of special effects and environments and tools and weapons and beasts and battle skills to use - though the death physics are terrible, but standard in the industry. I get no satisfaction from killing monsters at all. Where is the decapitation, the slicing in two, the smashing to bloody hamburger special effects. There is nothing, its unbearable to me. This game is so full of unholy filthiness and cruel unhumanity smashing the damn things to bits is the only enjoyment I get from playing and it isn't there, nothing - otherwise give it a pass. Actually just give this game pass. The market is soo bloated with options, players need to discriminate. No Affirmative Action for Amalur, time to move on. Time is valuable.
3174	0	a	So, you'll notice that I didn't invest much time in this game. It was suggested by a friend when I was needing a new game to play, so I added it to my wishlist and waited for it to go on sale.  When I finally was able to play it, I made it through part of the opening quest. The story seemed captivating enough...but the controls are *so unintuitive* that I just can't play the game. There is no strafe with q/e, you cannot move with clicking of the mouse, the camera feels overly sensitive. Not really pleased, would have rather used the money on another game :(
3175	0	a	Feels like running around inside the ghost of an MMO, which I guess it sort-of is. There were plenty of things that I liked about the game, but the empty feeling extends throughout, combat is entirely unchallenging (which is a damn shame as it looks and feels good, you just get bored of wading through mobs, swatting them like amazingly easy to swat flies. Pointlessly swatting already dead flies.), there are far too many meaningles and trivial 'fetch' sidequests, and the story really drags. There is stacks of lore but it was impossible to care about any of it in the slightest, because the whole game felt like an abandoned theme park.
3176	0	a	It sucks i quit. The game wont let me remap the keys so it is a waste of my time i cant adjust to using the w,s,a,d buttons.
3177	0	a	$20 was too much for this game. It has a playstyle that is a mix between Two Worlds and Fable, with combat like a mix between Fable 1 and 2. It is underwhelming to boring in almost every regard.
3178	0	a	The battle system is outstanding but not much skills to play and also are not creative at all, atfer few battles will get bored very quick. Special effects are just normal level, enemies are to many same appearance with different names quite sad with this part, the difficulty is toooo easy, even playing in the hard mode, story just ordinary so overall 70/100.
3179	0	a	Crashes everytime I try going into a certain area in the game regarding the mainquest.
3180	0	a	This is a very well made and refined game, but I just find it hard to enjoy with so much better RPG's readily available in the same price range. The game is extremely repetitive and the 'revolutionary combat' is nothing more then countless hours of button mashing. The NPC's were not engaging or unique and offered poor and repetitive quests. Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game, but for the 20$ price tag I would have expected much more out of this game. For a game that competes against both Dark Souls and Skyrim, this game falls short in almost every aspect. However the one thing this game does have going for it is it's reliability, it has very smooth frame rates and has never crashed on me. All in all, spend your hard earned cash on Dark souls, Skyrim or even Mount and Blade, not this generic button masher.
3181	0	a	Game crashes constantly, DRM apparently requires you to have an internet connection to play? Nothing that really stands out about the game in the short time I played.  I can't recommend it.
3182	0	a	Love RA Salvador. Hate this game
3183	0	a	I might have enjoyed this game, but the camera controls are completely insane. Mouse right to turn the camera right and mouse left to turn the camera left *and* down? How did this make it all the way to release while being all but unplayable because you have to stop every three steps to reorient your camera?
3184	0	a	Don't Get me wrong its a pretty good game. visuals are great and voices are well done. It's just boring and repetitive. The story really didn't pull me far enough into the world. The quests were mediocre fetch quests or kill that bad guy. Couldn't get far enough into it to care after awhile. It probably gets better later but I just couldn't find a reason to continue it.
3185	0	a	This game is a mish-mosh of a million tiny things that don't fit together well.  The combat sucks, flat out. Got old AMAZINGLY fast. The camera is garbage. Disgusting. Trash. Kinda nice looking at points, but kinda terrible looking at others. Dialogue system is super clunky and makes me wanna kick puppies.  Don't waste your time with this smoothie of a game.
3186	0	a	Great game, but overall, it needs patch updates for bugs and glitches within the game. Bugs that prevent you from progressing further in the game. Steam should put warning labels on games that are not patched.
3187	0	a	* If you want to check out any of the other characters besides the first one you are playing, you had better BACKUP those SaveGames because this game will wipe them because it can NOT track multiple characters.   I believe this is a practice from the 'Commodore 128s with a Hard Drive Days'.   I discovered that the 'new let me check out a rogue/hief character' can only Block OR Run Away.   Weapons can NOT be Drawn, hence they can NOT be swung OR fired.   I wish I had read this review before I had written it.   In answer to your questions: Yes, I checked that first thing. Yes, it works perfectly. No, all my other games work fine.  Yes, I looked there but nobody else has this problem or cared to answer. &lt;-- HEY! It must be me! Go buy this game!   Do ya reckon? ;&gt;)   
3188	0	a	Combat is not revolutionary or more interesting than any other RPG - In fact it's much more linear. Combat is not better just because I can spam buttons and things will happen. You don't even have to aim the bow ffs. The melee attacks are 'aimed' using vague directions of which way to swing.   The interface is clunky and irritating to deal with. The button mappings are restrictive and unintuitive.   The fact that this game used to be $50 astounds me considering the low quality of development - I paid $10 for it on a Steam sale and I feel that was too much.
3189	0	a	The game is so boring and dull you'll wish for a good pillow, the only way this is fun really is if you love games like World of Warcraft without the people to talk to and a lot less fun. I honestly tried to force myself to play this game through and I could not.
3190	0	a	Although i'm not a huge fan of the genre in general; i still feel that given the titles' high rating it should deliver more than the 'grindy' gameplay that it offers. Given the money i spent on the game, I struggled through the first couple of hours of the hoping to find something engaging. This didnt happen for me, so given that there is an overwhelming majority of positive rapport i felt i should warn that, for some people, this may not be a game you'll enjoy.
3191	0	a	I always wondered what single player WoW was like
3192	0	a	Imagine an MMO without the MMO. A generic, large world with generic enemies and boring quests thrown together over typical fighting mechanics and dull lore. It's on sale for $6 at the time of this writing and I still recommend saving your money.
3193	0	a	This game got some potential, but this potential getting buried under enormous lands, thousands indetical fed-ex quests, and pretty weak 'Destiny changing' plot. It feels like single player MMORPG and plays that way. And the most terrible thing about Amalur, that this fantasy game made without fantasy. Srsly. Most generic fantasy lore you will ever find. Yes, you got some stories about 'telling', Fae's and stuff, but after that you can just name every clishe you will remember.  But again, it's got some potetial. It's just developers didn't made it to solid and interesting game.  PS And when I'm tell you that this game is enormous, I don't kidding you, guys. By time when you will reach final stages, you could travel to China from USA. On foot.

3195	0	a	This game is like Skyrim but dull. And they just went overboard on the visual flair. It looks ridiculous and plays tedious. I can forgive a lot in an RPG if I can get into the story, but the pacing is mud.
3196	0	a	Feels like a single player mmo with god of war style combat.
3197	0	a	I thought driving rovers in Take on Mars was boring, then i finished Kingdoms of Amalur. This game is just a sum of zillion ultra boring quests. Stay away from this cure for insomnia....
3198	0	a	Okay so where to begin? Take a generalized fantasy idea, release it as an offline MMORPG and well, here we are.   Kingdom's of Amalur... Reckoning?   Usually we save these type of lowbrow subtitles for terrible sequels but I guess they just wanted to cut out the middle man and admit this game is straight up garbage right from the get go... that being said, here's the general idea:  It's the cliche, you're the chosen one except you just don't know it yet. You need to prove yourself to a bunch of lowlife commoners by fetching buckets of well water and killing rats in multiple cellars or 'dungeons'. Don't forget to pick flowers and melt down magic stones at alchemy desks as an annoying side meta game to the already implemented side quest meta game.  Again it's one of those games where being a thief / rogue / stealth character is incredibly beneficial. It's getting to the point where single player RPG's developed today should just lock you in as a thief and you can choose to allocate stat points differently if you don't like looting treasure in a treasure looting game.  If you decide to purchase it then prepare yourself for monotonous fetch quests, non-existant plot lines, you can skip over so you can fetch the next peice of candy, and average game play with long walks across open fields of nothingness.... occasionally fighting some disgrunteld vagabond's and wolves looking for their next meal ticket.  You will certainly be in for the 'reckoning' of a life time if you purchase it at full price...
3199	0	a	I found myself fighting the camera more than the bad guys.   I can't be bothered to play an action-based RPG where I have to swing the camera harder than my sword.
3200	0	a	This game is terrible. The combat is sorely unbalanced, its the same hack and slash on repetitive enemies over and over and over again. There are three types of dungeons and they reuse and recycle. Its the same visual effects through the entire game. When they tell you theyve added 3 hours of content it means theyve added 6 Rocks Trolls each which takes 30 minutes to hack and slash to death. Its constant mouse and keyboard mashing doing the same move over and over again until the single target you are slashing on is dead. The majority of the moves and abilities are useless, the stealth system sucks, and walking through an area will pull every mob in the entire zone. 2/3rds of the way through the game I had 3M gold saved up with nothing to spend it on. The DLC is glitchy and the voice acting sucks. I understand why they didnt make a sequal, and the company who made the game went completely out of business. DONT BUY THIS GAME! HUGE WASTE OF MONEY when you can play Morrowind, Oblivion, any of the Dragon Ages, Skyrim, or any of the Witcher series.   The ONLY saving grace is that the weapons look cool until you hit the Prismere items later in the game. Then it looks like someone stole granny's red rock collection and forged it into armor. Bleh!
3201	0	a	 GAMEPLAY:  3/10   STORY:  8/10  This game is impossible to enjoy with the field of view (FoV) settings.   The gameplay would be great...but that damn camera makes it unplayable. You literally end up fighting people off screen. I think there was a little attempt to make the camera zoom out in combat, but it's so wonky I couldn't really tell.   It's a shame. The story is good. It shows that R.A. Salvatore wrote for this game. The only way I could make it bearable was to mod the FoV to be zoomed out to where I couldn't really see the actually quite nice looking characters and equips. I don't see why they couldn't make the camera zoom out in combat to accomodate all enemies you were fighting.  Read the wiki for the story...don't buy the game.
3202	0	a	dont buy the steam version crashes a lot
3203	0	a	I bought this game due to the sale price and the glowing IGN review... and holy crap this is the most generic RPG I've ever played. The art style is a direct ripoff of WOW, attempting to mask low poly counts and a lack of advanced effects with overly bright colors. NPC interactions are ripped directly from recent Bioware titles. The lockpicking system is an exact copy of Skyrim. I was willing to overlook the ugly WOW-clone graphics for an open-world hack and slasher like Dragon's Dogma, since the Fighter/Rogue/Mage class sytem is identical to that game (suprise?) but the combat lacks Dogma's satisfying brutality.   Normally I like it when elements of great games are remixed into something new, but it's all done in such a clunky way, it just makes me wish I were playing the other, better games.   Ultimately this game feels like something that was put together in a soulless board room full of suits who picked pieces of top selling games at random in search of cold, hard profits... and oh look, it's EA, so that's probably exactly what happened.
3204	0	a	Cartoonish look and clumbsy controls. Camera kept spazzing in too close or out too far, often behind objects so I couldn't even see myself. No wonder this game bombed.  UPDATE: tried playing some more. Still a mediocre game. Thumbs down.  Amazing how bad, clumsy, and sluggish the combat is. It's like playing an old NES 64 game. So bad.
3205	0	a	Simply put, this game is not worth the time investment.
3206	0	a	Very stale game, very predictable and nothing unique with the combat at all. All the spells etc. are the same overused classic ones. I am a fan of great games like skyrim, world of warcraft, fable I etc. and this game is just a cheap copy.
3207	0	a	I really wanted to like this game, but it just doesn't hold up in today's RPG, open-world market. Games like Skyrim and Inquisition make this seem like a Facebook game.  PROS:  + Fun character customization options  CONS:  - Doesn't appear to be designed for PC - Quests get repetitive - LOTS of walking and running thru bare landscapes - Dead easy - Camera angle makes me want to kill myself
3208	0	a	Camera angle is sickeningly close, and the limited view will give you an incredible headache. Want to zoom out? HA. You cant. Game is unplayable, waste of $20
3209	0	a	this game is seriously TOO EASY WTH... combat is like your character in permanent GOD MODE. This makes customization of characters useless since hell anything will work against such weak enemies and bosses zzz
3210	0	a	Played for half an hour. Game crashed twice. Can't really play it like this.
3211	0	a	I've tried several times to play this, but I couldn't get far into the game without giving up. It's a real chore to play and not worth your time.
3212	0	a	The game is more an action game than a rpg. And as such i can not recommend it. The fantasy is also quite thin in terms of story and lore, the scenery however is lovely.
3213	0	a	I nominate this for the 'Test of Time' reward. Because this game never ends and will test your patience. I look forward to one day having the 300+hours essential to completing the tutorial.
3214	0	a	Like a poor mans Skyrim. This game has character but the voice acting is poor and the combat can be slightly simple. I actually enjoy some of the mechanics a little more than some of the bigger budget games but I found myself becoming bored with the story so quick it wasn't enough to keep me playing.
3215	0	a	oh my goodness this has got to be the worse game ever , no way to zoom out camera, horrible gameplay just trying to control the character dont waste your money
3216	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ass game. Waste of money.
3217	0	a	Just like every RPG. Completly rubbish and boring.
3218	0	a	The controls. The controls man, they suck balls.  I played with an XBOX360 controller and then a mouse, neither of which did much to allieviate the problem of that slow, clunky camera and hyperspeed movement of your character. I fiddled with the settings but alas there was no way to get him to slow down and to get the camera to be responsive enough. It wasn't an issue with my hardware, as the game itself ran perfectly. My pc is fairly average, but still the game ran a solid 55-60fps.  The opening is very drab and dull, you're fateless do you don't die forever and now you have to something something well of souls I don't know. I honestly tried to keep up with the story and plot but it was just so generic.  The combat leaves much to be desired. There is no lock on that you control, the game decides when you are targeting an enemy all by itself. This functioned well enough, but I was really wanting a dedicated button to be able to break and change my target. The combat is tremendously slow and clunky. There is little to no skill required for bows, the daggers are overpowered and the magic is the most meh magic I've ever cast.  Now, granted I only just left the tutorial cave after the Troll fight, but I could not bring myself to play on. I was just constantly thinking 'This isn't fun, I have at least five other games on steam I bought in the sales that I could be playing right now.'  I do no recommend this game because the controls are absurd, some of the worst I've ever encountered (and I played Dark Souls with the mouse for a session), the setting and story is bland and the combat is lacking. How this game gets high scores and recommendations anywhere is beyond me. I even had my friend who had played the ps3 version take the controls and he said it felt very different. If you really want this game, get it on ps3.  If you still really want this game on pc, â‚¬5 is what I paid for it and I'm glad I didn't spend any more than that.
3219	0	a	I'm generally a fan of light hack n'slash rpg gamestyles but honestly.... couldnt get past the first few hours. Nothing compelled me to continue on. Obviously a good deal of effort has been put into gameplay fluidity and mechanics but it's a stale world and nothing you havent seen before. So this is what is birthed from talented designers, big budgets and EA's teat? After playing other action affairs like Dragon's Dogma, Tomb Raider and Deus Ex this winter, it felt as deep and satisfying as a spring puddle.
3220	0	a	Started out fun, but got super repetitive around level 25. It feels like it should be a huge MMO but you are the only on logged in. I ended up quitting about 25 hours in. YMMV
3221	0	a	An MMO without multiplayer. Whenever I'm playing I can't stop thinking about what an awesome MMO this would have been.  *sigh*
3222	0	a	I was looking forward to playing an awesome game like the elder scrolls. as soon as i started the game i knew it was going to entertain me for hours. but i didnt even kill those giant rats because the camera sensitivity was on hlaf. I turned it all the way down and it still was super fast. This ERROR ruined the game. Does anyone know how to fix this???? if i can have it on low sensitivity, thuis game would be 11/10
3223	0	a	There is no Co-op in this game, so basicly the steam lied to me about it, but it's 'okay' (i searched for a good co-op game when I bought it).  This game is like Fable in so many ways. But It feels 'incomplete'. So many things missed - like music? -, but the graphic is nice, the action is pretty cool, enjoyable. I read about the game time, 40 hour if you really now what are you doing, 100+ if not. Too much maybe?  So many cool things, but still, so many thing missed, so many part of the game is empty, 'cheap'. Kingdom of Amalur wanna be become a very good game, and It's got a good basic, but never reach the goal.
3224	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ass game. Waste of money.
3225	0	a	Just like every RPG. Completly rubbish and boring.
3226	0	a	Game wont go past tutorial, you find yourself unable to interact with the game, attack, use spell, and open chest. all you can do is run and enter stealth mode and get killed by the game. gg
3227	0	a	This game is an MMO without the O or the second M, as in a 'Massive' waste of time
3228	0	a	NO. JUST STOP. NO. By the time I finished the intro cutscene I had already decided that I would rather rip my own legs off using my kneecaps as tool of choice than even playing a single second of this game.  Thankfully there was no reason for me to do any of those horrible things and thankfully my legs are intact.  8/8 Actually made me cry!
3229	0	a	Keeps freezing my computer on: windows 10 nvidia gtx 980 i5 Do not buy if you have windows 10 they will never fix this game
3230	0	a	As a huge fan of Western RPGs, I thought I would love Kingdoms of Amalur. It seems to have a lot of positive reviews. However, I'm four hours into the game and still don't feel that compelled to keep playing it.  Here are the reasons I don't really like the game: 1. The voice acting is pretty bad 2. I find the main story and the characters boring 3. Gameplay has been laughably easy so far 4. It doesn't compare favourably to Skyrim, Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights, Divinity etc. - just so many elements that are not as good. It doesn't have the atmosphere of a lot of these games.  I've pretty much given up on it, which is a shame as it was Â£20.
3231	0	a	An odd game odd game play and story a little all over the place still somehow endearing good for one play trhough would not play it back ok if discounted
3232	0	a	Trash in its purest form
3233	0	a	I haven't purchased a game with the EA logo on it since BF1942 due to their underhanded practices, but a friend highly recommended this game and even paid for it. With that disclaimer out of the way, on to the review.  Overall appearance: 5/10. Standard, generic, fly by night MMO look throughout the game. It is vastly empty, with very specific paths to follow. This is reinforced with invisible walls everywhere which prevent you from doing the simplest of tasks like jumping over a log. This kind of unpolished short cut methodology is fine for F2P MMOs, but not for a single player game. The armor sets are frequently reused, so you can have 3 or 4 different sets, yet they all look identical. The developers didn't even take the extra day to retexture the pieces for each set.  Combat mechanics: 1/10. This game has hands down, the absolute worst combat mechanics I have ever witnessed in any game. Even Revelation 2012 was better in this regard. You go to attack a specific enemy, and are instantly, uncontrollably attacking something completely different. This can include other monsters, but also can include a rock wall, the ground, or even nothing at all. This unpolished, wonky mess of a system can and will get you killed by bosses over and over.  Camera movements: 2/10. You have no control whatsoever of the bouncy, rubber banding camera, which frequently pops underground and into trees and rocks during fights so you can't see what's going on. If you suffer from motion sickness, take your pills before attempting to play.  Questing contents: 8/10. There is a lot to do in this game. Nearly town NPC will have some kind of quest chain for you to accomplish. Not just one Fed Ex quest, but actual, multiple leg quests. This is a nice thing to see in this day and age of single mission, gofer quests that most games offer. This doesn't allow for a great deal of replayability though, since the quests and dialogue are identical regardless of character build.  In general, this game feels just like any other fly by night MMO, with the one exception that there is no one else around. The armor sets leave a lot to be desired, using the same pieces for several different versions. And with the horrendous camera whizzing around all over the place, along with your character randomly attacking whatever the game decides it should, make this an exercise in patience more than something fun to do. Even on sale, it's not worth it.  While there were a number of high profile names associated with this title, it is painfully obvious they were merely lounging while resting on their laurels as a handful of under skilled interns developed the game. Many cardinal sins were incorporated along the way, and while I really wanted to like the game, in the end just couldn't. If I wanted to pay money for this kind of frustration, I'd get back together with my ex.
3234	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has the same pitfalls as most modern day RPGs. There is a massive player world with dozens and dozens of side quests, but the immersion factor is sorely missing. I ended up with the same problem I had when I played most of the Elder Scrolls series. My character became too powerful from pursuing all of the side quests, and nothing in the game was a challenge anymore. Add to that the fact that I reached a roadblock in the main quest which involved a dungeon that took more than five minutes to walk back through because of a missing item that I could not find, and there was not enough enjoyment here to keep me happy. The game seems more like work than play. It was very unenjoyable.   I put in over 40 hours, and I am done. I think my save is bugged, and I'm not willing to start over. Suffice it to say that I won't be completing this one. I can't recommend it for the same reasons that I can't recommend any of the Elder Scrolls games. It's too ambitious with no grounding. The story isn't interesting, and the levelling is lacks excitement. I give this one about a 3 on a 10 scale.
3235	0	a	Get outta here.
3236	0	a	For most intents and purposes, this game feels very much like a Skyrim clone. Regardless, it did keep me entertained for a few weeks. IF you haven't played Skyrim, I would recommend playing that instead. If you need an RPG and are bored of anything Bethesda has out, then buy this to keep yourself entertained until a better game comes along. If you do play this, be sure to make multiple save files, like maybe one an hour. I have encountered several bugs that were very close to game-breaking(the Amalur wiki usually explains workarounds). Personally, I would have preferred another Bethesda(Elder Scrolls, Fallout series), or Bioware(Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights) game, but this game made nice filler until the next Dragon Age gets released.
3237	0	a	This is an alright game. The story is interesting and the mechanics are kind of fun. The game offers over 100 hours of adventuring fun. The skills allow you to fully customize your character into three different skill trees and get special bonuses depending on how you do it. You can also respec as many times as you like(with ample coin).  However, this game has some glaring problems. For one, the game is plagued by copious bugs. It is very frustrating to have to reload the game once or twice an hour because you get stuck in a loading screen, or stuck in the floor, or because the game just feels like randomly crashing. The game also has a strange and clunky cheap feeling to it. The cities are filled with guards who have strange psychic powers and can sense wrong doing from half a mile away. You're allowed to play good or evil and make choices in a Mass Effect like style. This is fun until you realize that your choices really don't matter much. You can go into a town and kill everyone, but that just means you killed a bunch of quest givers, so there really isn't a point. It feels like EA put a lot of effort into making the expansions and just left the bugs, because fixing bugs doesn't make money.  Overall this was an okay game and I recommend it if you'd like a nice time sink, can get it cheap, and can overlook the cheap design and buggy gameplay.
3238	0	a	It is painfully obvious that Kingdoms of Amalur was written as a console game. It is linear, handholding, simplistic, and devoid of inspired design. That it comes out of EA is no surprise either.  Graphics: 6/10  For a 2012 game, the graphics are mediocre. Bloom is used excessively outdoors to mask said mediocre graphics. Textures are not too bad, but there is a limited variety of them, giving a repetitive feeling to the game. There is a WoWish feeling to many of the graphics, which takes away a point for coat-tail riding... not to mention ugliness.  Sound: 6.75/10  Sound breakdown: ambient - 5, music - 6, voice acting - 9, game sounds (weapons, magic) - 7.  The ambience of a game, especially an RPG, is important. The sound ambience in KoA is rather bland and unmemorable. The music isnt much better, but not 'bad'. Game sounds are very... typical? Plain? The voice acting is quite good however. Essentially the whole voice cast of Dragon Age Origins has returned.  Gameplay: 2.65/10  Gameplay breakdown: Camera control - 0/10, quests - 2/10, combat - 4/10, magic - 4/10, NPC interactions - 5/10, environment interactions - 1/10, skill system - 3/10 ,crafting system - 2/10  There are several things that bring down this score for KoA for the PC, not the least of which is the **abysmal** camera design. Camera control is for all practical intents and purposes non-existent. You cannot even adjust the zoom distance! Coupled with the total lack of camera options, the cameras automated nature is atrociously programmed. Example: the moment combat begins, the camera immediately lowers its altitude from about neck level, to knee level.  Yes, it basically plants itself into the ground, and there is **nothing** you can do about it, except get out of combat by killing whatever is around you, or running away. Many times, you, the character, are actually removed from the screen entirely, and the camera points at nothing in particular!  I suspect this is because the camera is programmed to point at the 'center of gravity' so to speak, between and you mob of enemies. This becomes a major problem when say there are 4 enemies, and one of you, because the camera is going be pulled disproportionately towards the enemies position, but not all the way, so while pointing at the center of gravity of 5 equally weighted bodies, what you are left starring at is some random patch of grass or a rock wall.  Trust me... the camera is **BAD**, and it is a major stumbling block in attempting to have fun with this game. It just becomes more and more and more frustrating as you progress, and to my knowledge there is no fixing the cameras behavior.  The camera should never negatively impact gameplay... but KoAs does in a serious way.  On to other aspects of gameplay:   Quests were designed to be hand-holding baby quests. All the fun and adventure of QUESTING is completely removed, and quests in this game (and others) are not really quests at all. Quests are about discovery, mystery, intrigue, exploration, adventure, danger, etc.   What are called 'quests' in KoA are more like... boring. It basically comes down to, talk to NPC, follow your fully neurally integrated severely anachronistic GPS unit to the designated target, pick up and/or kill whatever, activate personal teleportation device to return to original NPC.  What do you even call that?  Combat is basically an exercise of stun locking. For those not aware, stun lock happens when it is possible to chain together multiple stun inducing attacks/effects back to back which have a recast/repeat/refresh interval that is less than the duration of the stun effect itself. Basically it means whoever hits first wins, no matter how much armor, HP, DPS, etc, anyone has.  Combat moves look flashy, explosive, bright, and fast, but somehow completely lack any feeling of depth. Its all superficial; for looks only, and it gets old, quick.  Magic is... tangential? I dunno... with the combat meta-game being solely about how you can stun lock your opponent (and its not difficult to split multiple opponents), magic isnt that much of a factor in anything. Spells are uninspired, and just meh in general.  NPC interaction: basically you can either talk to them, or kill them (or both). Lots of dialogue, which is good for immersion, but most of it feels irrelevant (all voiced very well though).  Environmental interaction: aside from opening doors... essentially none. Which is not acceptable for a game, especially an RPG game, circa 2012.  Skill system: There are 9 skills you can learn, each which have 10 levels. This is a low number of skills, but not in and of itself a bad thing. However, the skills themselves are uninspired, and are just... generic. You have your blacksmithing, your lock picking, your sagecrafting (gem/rune crafts that you stick into sockets), your persuassion, your stealth, etc. Its all very forgettable in the end; nothing stand out.  Also, you have a max of 40 levels to attain, and you start with 4 skills depending on your race, so youd think youd have a maximum of 44/90 skills, so youd better be careful what you choose, right?!  Nope.   You can actually get, without DLC, 89/90 skills. With DLC, all 90.  Stat system: There are no stats in KoA. Thats right. No strength, no dex, no wis or int, or anything.  Crafting system: Scrambling eggs is more complex than the crafting system in KoA (which I guess for the average console gamer, would put KoAs crafting system into the 'challenging' category).  Immersion: 2/10  It is painfully obvious that you are playing a game. From ridiculous weapon proportions, to the mysterious inability to jump, to the uncountably vast horde of invisible walls that restrict your movement, to the bizarre tendency for every single dungeon to be narrow passages that inevitably circle back to the entrance, the game world is not believable as a 'real' fantasy world that a person can lose themselves in.  Examples:   Weapons are of ludicrous size, which break immersion. Example: iron warhammer... youd think that at maximum, it might look like something like a 40 pound sledgehammer, which is a gigantic hammer that very few but the largest of large men could actually swing consistantly with power, and I mean actually swing, not just lift off the ground and bump it into things... well the iron warhammer in KoA, from what I can estimate, looks like its about 100 - 200 pounds in the handle, and 800 - 1000 pounds on the head... and a level 0 elf girl can swing it like its nothing. Literally, like it is not even there.  Invisible walls... everywhere.  No non-prescripted jumping.  Dungeons are circles.  Repetitive textures (although they are not of bad quality)... gives the feeling youre not actually going anywhere.  Linear progression of difficulty. Example: your first enemy outside of the starting dungeon is a bunch of wolves (how creative... because thats never been done before (better yet, your first enemy ever is a giant rat)). Those starting wolves are of the same size and build of every other wolf you will ever see in the game, and theyll all use the same tactics. But as you travel, the wolves in other parts of the world magically get stronger and stronger, and while they dont directly scale to your level, the designers did a pretty good job of approximating what level you would be when you reached a certain set of wolves and scaled their level accordingly to that approximation.  Basically it doesnt feel like you ever actually get more powerful.  Story: 4/10  Uninspired (that seems to be a theme KoA has going). Generic at best. Nothing in way of theme you havnt already heard before. Evil thing corrupts some king, king makes war, you are the risen messiah, go save the world as you are basically predetermined to do.    Final score: 4.28/10  I cannot recommend this game to any serious fan of RPGs who is on a PC.   You will be disappointed.
3239	0	a	Won't load at going in to the Laboratory...
3240	0	a	This game is the final nail in the coffin for Electronic Arts games. After paying! for and downloading this game it is impossible to play without apparently altering my root menu. I uninstalled Origin after it became apparent that they would not let my use the Origin store to buy new games/dlc, but had hoped that EA games on Steam would be better. They are not. EA has shown repeatedly that they do not care about whether or not you can play their games, mearly that you give them money. They are single handedly killing the gaming industry and I, for one, would not be upset if the entire company went bankrupt, went to jail, or were to be killed horribly. In fact I would shake the hand of anyone that did. EA has stolen money from me for faulty products like the snake oil salesmen they are. I wash my hands of them.
3241	0	a	its not that bad but its not great, honestly its not worth buying it is a really difficult game not much of a learning curve and it gets boring pretty quickly.
3242	0	a	Looks and plays great, but something is lacking. Maybe it's what theologists call 'a soul'. Everytime I play i get bored.   If you need a good exploration based ARPG, play any Piranha Bytes game. Even Risen 2 or Gothic 3.
3243	0	a	Just couldn't get into it. Felt like it borrowed shamelessly from a few games like Fable &amp; Elder Scrolls for example. I wanted a new experience and got a cocktail of old ones. Not for me.
3244	0	a	This game is pretty good. There is a lot to do, you feel like you are sort of making a difference, and the challenges grow with the character. Getting new gear is a treat as they are all visually more and more awesome. However, you need to save often! Not because you might die... lol... oh no... but because you might run into a game bug. So far I've found two and the second one actually disables fast travel entirely. The map in the game is big, but not too big, but the problem is just the annoyance of having to run everywhere. Then I found out when looking for a community to tell me how to get out of the bug, that the game studio apparently imploded. So, now I'm stuck, having to run around everywhere and the game is becoming more of an annoying grind than the fun questing adventure that I've been playing for hours. Big dissappointment and no chance of help. Get the game if you want, but read up on all the quest bugs first. You CAN get stuck. You CAN screw up the whole game. Gamer beware.
3245	0	a	Gets boring quick.

3248	0	a	After playing for three hours I have had enough. The combat is terrible, the AI is laughable, and freedom within the world is utterly restricted.
3249	0	a	If you're using windows 10 don't expect to be able to play for more than a few minutes, there's some awful bug that will crash the game, and the developer never â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bothered trying to fix it.
3250	0	a	A very boring rpg. Unless you have many free hours to kill, I recommend you stay away from this game. I was able to get 9 hours in before I made the decision to drop it for better games. Everything about the game was just too boring. The combat was super easy, the class system was average and the quests and story just didnâ€™t have the right hook to get me interested.  The combat seems fun at first but then you quickly realize just how easy and frustrating it is. Enemies are generally dumb or cheesy. You can either face roll enemies or have no ability to dodge correctly, thanks to the wonderful camera and dodge system. You can try to dodge out of the way of an attack but occasionally the camera will be in such a spot that you instead dodge head first into the enemy, taking the damage and then some that you were trying to avoid. This happens more than enough to be frustrating. The quests and story is what truly killed this game for me. The beginning of the story is very bland and almost feels unoriginal. You come back to life after being dropped onto hundreds of decaying corpses to find out now that you have come back, you now have no fate and can change destinies. It seems like a cool concept but itâ€™s surrounded by so many mediocre and clichÃ© rpg elements that it drowns itself. I looked up the ending to the game to see if it redeems itself but let me tell you no, it does not. The story might have been more exciting if it wasnâ€™t consumed by the hundreds of similar rpg quest tropes. Most of the quests turn into looking for a monster to kill, finding a missing person, and picking up items off the map or enemies.   I really wanted to like this game, I was excited for it when it came out but I held off on it hearing that it was just boring repetitive gameplay. Now that I was able to get it off Steam for cheap I have to say, they were right. Donâ€™t bother playing this game. If you really have to though wait for a sale and make sure you have 20+ hours to dedicate to it.
3251	0	a	High production values are offset by a lack of overall depth.   Pros: Nice visuals, good voice acting, fun combat and a deep skill system that almost warrants a replay.  Cons: Mission structure is rarely more than 'run to location, fight enemies, collect item, backtrack'. It wears thin pretty quickly.   You can see where all of the individual influences have made their mark, but the end product is unremarkable due to 30-odd hours of repetitive and shallow missions. I'd recommend it, but not for $60.
3252	0	a	Feels like an MMO both story- and contentwise. Combat is as boring as Fable.
3253	0	a	Better than Skyrim.
3254	0	a	Boring
3255	0	a	I played this game for about 12 minutes.
3256	0	a	Would be really good if you could actually load the game!! DO NOT BUY
3257	0	a	This got boring very fast, looks ugly. 1/10
3258	0	a	Completely mad about the fast travel bug in Her righteous fury. Have 54 gaming hours wasted!
3259	0	a	This game seems to be overall crap. Graphics are terrible. I can deal with bad graphics, that's not a major issue, but.. add in that the targeting/aiming system is utter crap as well.. The fighting is terrible.. the storyline from what I could read before my brain about died from it shows to be crap.. I literally saw no upsides to this game.. Don't waste your money.
3260	0	a	Cheap Hooker of RPG's
3261	0	a	Stunning!  No, I mean that literally. Stunning. That's all there is. You stun them, they stun you, somebody dies. Usually you unless you play like a sissy. Dev's didn't really think the system through well.  It gets even more downvote because it really is a great and fun game at most points, they just REALLY messed up on some key aspects.
3262	0	a	Best moment in the game was the end. So i can play other games.
3263	0	a	A console game for children. DO NOT BUY. Not even on sale...  Bright colors, stupid writing, roughly as difficult as falling asleep when very tired..  Controls are pure console garbage, nothing even near a real PC game... I don't know, there's simply not one thing that's elegant about this game. A total waste of money, even if it were $1  Avoid
3264	0	a	oh hell no, did i really waste half of the day to download this crap ? Ughh forst game control i have seen so far lmao, just don't buy it as it's worthless and almost not playable -.- waste of my life D:
3265	0	a	Don't bother.
3266	0	a	The best way to describe this game is like a 'super-sized' edition of the game FABLE. There is a similar feel but greater openess. While that sounds great, it isn't as great as it sounds. This is no Skyrim or TES game for example.   The biggest issue with this game that is overlooked by most reviewers, or that they keep mum about, is the 'cell'-shaped, 'inside a canyon' type feel of the game world. It's mostly a collection of large FPS-style levels. There is no grand, open-world that is seamless, like you would find in Gothic 3, Fallout 3/New Vegas, or Skryim, for example.  Instead, every areas is surrounded by a border of large hills and trees. You are confined to large sector. Similar to Neverwinter Nights. Or, imagine running around Un'Goro crater in World of Warcraft. Now imagine every other area and zone in World of Warcraft as the same design. The only way to get to one area from another was to run through a narrow canyon pass to the next canyon area. This at time is seemless in that there is no 'loading next level' pause for every area but for some areas, it does have to stop to load the area. Additionally, dungeons are instance-like, you enter and it loads the level. That's tolerable. As for the 'open game-world' canyon-running esque feel:  CRAP-LAME!  The other issue is that all the area look very similar to each other. Like NWN or WoW, they just have different colored fog/haze palettes to them and the aesthetic design doesn't seem to be all that different. Maybe some clown that worked on the game might want to argue 'well the tree-branches in confined zone A bend upwards whereas the ones in Zone B bend upwards at a lower angle by 2 degrees'. Whatever. If the game engine had limitations, it's not the gamer's fault it feels completely tacky.  What works in this game is the style of the characters, some of the decor, and art. The game itself has a very polished feel. But it also feels it is missing some key ingredients. It's like french-fries cooked really great, but missing the salt. It's like a juicy bacon burger without any sauce. It feels like the game engine is behind the times, and they tried to polish it as best they could, couldn't do it, so they continued the polish the utmost best to get it where it is. That would make sense, and I don't mind that, if for example, it would have majorily delayed the game to go all the way back and redo everything with a better engine.  Even though the graphics feel old, ARE old in various ways, the game sometime has performance issues for me. I run Skyrim with ridiculous detail but this game chugs at times. I can only surmise there wasn't enough time for optimization or in their efforts to polish it, as-if they had added glitz never originally intended for this game engine and it didn't work out. I can only surmise.  Lastly, a lot of the levels are flat with minor bumps and the occasional low-level cliffs. There is a big lack of vegetation making you feel as if you are running across a green carpet, like old school 3D games. This is no Gothic 3 that is uber-detailed with every nook and crany or like Skryim.  PROS: Great combat, combos, weapons, the graphic effects really accentuate this well. Great interaction with the NPCs, excellent polish. On the level with other RPGs like Gothic 3, for example or Skyrim. Lots of varied NPCs, craploads of unique side-quests. Good voice-acting. Tremedous background story and well fleshed out prose to articulate and act as the backbone for the game world. Comfortable 'talent-tree' type system. The characters all look like super-models. Not some 'rolls in the mud with pigs' looking characters like in Skryim. The assassin elf chick looks hot. You can opt to take a dark path. You can also opt to just slaughter all the annoying NPCs. The varied skills/powers is a huge plus, which adds depth to the gameplay. Excellent production values despite the 'behind the times' feel of the game engine. Engaging crafting system. Overall non-linear RPG, not to be overlooked if you like non-linear RPGs. Did I mention how polished it is? Completely lacks personality, although you can see areas where they really tried. For this, I put this in the PRO section because some people might find this was a WIN more than I did. The Fast-Travel system alleviates some of the 'run endless through the narrow canyon pass to next canyon/crater' feel. You can own your own homes. Lots of varied loot.  CONS: The EA/DRM system is a complete joke and useless. This alone is a sufficient reason not to buy the game. EA and Ubisoft have abominable system like this and don't deserve our $$$. You can buy great games (better games) from other companies that don't try to buttslam or inconvenience gamers with these NSA-style data collection scams. The story is totally boring. I really didn't give a crap about what was going on. The varied NPCs are very boring. Camera system is lacking. Super-Boring. Too restrictive in ways simliar to how FABLE was restrictive. Game needed some kind of 'edge', like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, drinking, some gore, etc. or just some kind of 'dark' element to better flesh it out. It felt too sanitized given the plot and darkness of some of the quests. You never felt anything about it. Example: Kill evil witch. OR: kill village she hates. You kill the village. Witch is pretty much like: 'OH, OK, that's nice. Here's a bit of gold.' You: 'OH, OK. Thanks.' Witch: 'Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, well, ummm. Buh-bye!' You: 'Yeah.' Game is like: 'Whatever.'  The canyon-esque zones are monotonous and utterly boring. I don't know, it was just so boring and un-engaging, that I just skipped through all the useless dialogue.  I actually found some battles to be hard.  The weapon system is grossly unbalanced, you will easily progress through quests to areas where there are no sufficient weapons to deal with the stronger enemies even in those areas. Imagine playing Skyrim to the very end with only Iron and Steel level items, with no Daedric or Ebony. You get to the point where even with epic items it takes like 7 hits to kill a remedial giant spider. Pretty fricken dumb if you ask me. This also ties to the problem with 'Classes'. There are three boring, generic choices: fighter dude, magic dude, rogue-dude, or hybrid. You will mostly like go with hybrid because being solid-fighter, solid magic dude, or rogue, whatever, is totally useless and underpowered. To adequetly survive, you must pick and choose from each. Hands down. No argument unless you want to waste your time trying to prove a point you know is already insipidly stupid. At times, if felt like Crusader of Might and Magic, running endlessly from one 'canyon' to the next.  The dispel-unlock system is a laughly broken piece of tird.  Ultimately, I liked the game gave choices and had lots of bells and whistles. The bland, boring environments and story, underpowered/unbalanced weapons/magic/talent system were huge disappointments. The world design was an epic let-down. Still, if you really enjoyed FABLE, you will really like this game. If you wanted FABLE but bigger, more stuff, more world, but ok with less character, less creativity, and boring story, then give this one a go. For any open-world RPG fan, I actually recommend it. Especially if it is on sale. I almost thumbed-up this game but couldn't in good conscience do that.  But man, is this game fricken boring! I fall asleep about 50% of the time I'm playing it. It tries to be perfect but it fails because it tries to be everything and it can't. It's like the Patrick Bateman of RPG games. There is an idea there, 'a kind of abstraction'. All the right pieces are there in order so that it fits in perfectly with all other RPGs of the genre it tries to win at, but behind the superficial front, it is souless.
3267	0	a	A big pile of stolen parts from more succesful games tied together with lackluster writing.
3268	0	a	The story was pretty good. Game tried to be like Dragon Age: Origins. I just gave up on it, bored me.
3269	0	a	First off this is not a bad game, even still i wouldnt recommend going through it because it is just painfully average. If you expect some epic rpg then no this is not quite it, if you want some easy hack and slash game then yeah this might be it. What bugged me the most, speaking of bugs this game has very little of it, is the quests are just boring as hell and even though there is a lot of background story to discover but it just seems to matter so god damn little. Fighting is pretty cool though i would have liked to see a more diverse skill system or some sort of diversity that is not in the game. Also i finished the game and didnt even get my top sorcery card which means i probably didnt do enough side quests, but heck they are boring as hell. LOTS of walking during quests and in between makes it a bit stupid at times as well. Yeah so my final verdict is don't go with this game if you expect the next skyrim or some epic rpg.
3270	0	a	KoA world is so boring and uninteresting. So many side missions to do but you couldnt care less
3271	0	a	Im quite sad,,, i played this game and loved it, but it kept crashing every ten minutes.... i did everything i could to fix it but apparently certain computers with Windows 10 just dont work on certain games.. SAD
3272	0	a	Just wanted to play single player and offline and yet needed to jump through EA hoops to make an online account for a game on Steam...
3273	0	a	Fun game for the level or so I could play it. A couple hours into it I'm getting weird bugs where buildings render only half the time and the quests don't show up on the map anymore. I'd get a refund if I hadn't bought the game so long ago. It's unplayable.
3274	0	a	It was too late for a refund when I realized it's a repetitive game with no detail work at all. It's very casual if you ask me(no one asks me but you know). There are much better games of this genre, I suggest you stay away from this one.
3275	0	a	I have not played this game much yet, but it has a really bad camera.
3276	0	a	This game is a steaming pile of $h1t. Forget playing it -- you can't even re-map the keys without the game glitching out on you! What a complete rip-off!
3277	0	a	It's basically fable 3.
3278	0	a	i guess once you get to a certain point the game just starts crashing, when you get to a loading screen it just keeps loading. i let it do that for 2 hours and nothing changed it said it was still loading so i restarted the game and then it wouldn't load
3279	0	a	The game itself is not half bad. it feels a bit old, and integrating it with EA's Orgin is a hassle. But that is not much of an issue to throw away the appeal of the game. However, The reason I gave this game a bad score is because I bought it with the DLC bundle without checking what the DLCs actually are (Can you blame me? it was on a summer sale). And one of the DLCs is a weapons and armour pack. It gave me overpowered weapons and armour for every class at the start of the game. That ruind the whole eperiance for me.
3280	0	a	Not a very intruiging story. Just get Skyrim, it's much better.
3281	0	a	I played this game for 4 houre then uninstalled. I played WOW for 1000s. enough said?
3282	0	a	Fun fact. This game requires third party registration. If you forget your account details, you can't play it.  Great game, can't play it anymore.  Would never buy from these guys again.
3283	0	a	boring waste money
3284	0	a	Well, it's basicly a 08/15 RPG. But it gets realy Boring Realy fast. Made the huge mistake to buy it when it was like 50$. Biggest miss buy i ever did.
3285	0	a	Maps and game WAY too small
3286	0	a	man i stuck in my quest?, how to clear it?
3287	0	a	Trash game, stay far away. Plays and looks like it was made in the 90s. Button mashing time waster.
3288	0	a	You want a real story with meaningful charachters? Play New Vegas instead.  This game is very repetitive and left me wondering why I should complete it.
3289	0	a	Can't get the game to run. 10/10 would uninstall again.
3290	0	a	Nope. Bad combat. Bad menus. Bad cameras. Bad storytelling. I've put over 300 hours in the Wticher series and this game broke me after 3. The story is basically told by every NPC giving you novel-length exposition that is impossible to care about. Every character name is made with a 'create-a-fantasy-character generator'. Here's a name I just made up: Yalprelth. I bet it exists in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game because every other horrible name does. Does my character have a name? At this point I don't even know or care. It's such a boring game and I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews.
3291	0	a	Basically add Fable 3, Skyrim, the Witcher, terrible graphics, and the worst graphics for a big budget title and you'll get this garbage.  Verdict: PASS
3292	0	a	An MMORPG turned into a singleplayer game.   Horrible.
3293	0	a	This game features the following: - A clunky menu - Graphics that were outdated two decades ago - A horrible camera in combat (did the developers EVER play a game?) - Lifeless, dull characters I couldn't care less about - Game design and controls from the mid 90s. The character moves so freakin fast it's ridiculous. And dodging an attack makes the charakter dodge for at least five meters. What were they thinking? - Boring gameplay, in the first 30 minutes you're getting bombarded with cutscenes, pre-rendered cutscenes, text to read, yada here, yada there. This is an open world game I heard. Well, I was extremely annoyed by all the interruptions from NPCs or cutscenes. - All the four races you can chose from share the exact same model, only the skin differs. Now that's really some effort they put in the game. - And so on and so on. I only played it for about half an hour and already was so bored I couldn't progress.  Problem probably is, I do like ES:Oblivion, ES:Skyrim, Witcher 3 and the new Tomb Raider.  After playing this games this game here is beyond playability. I will refund this game.
3294	0	a	Gather 'round, kiddies, uncle Nax is going to take you back in time! From the throbbing peal of EA's branding to the steely sparkle trailing around the logo, Kingdoms of Amalur wastes no time in dating itself. By the time the game boots, you'll feel like you've jumped straight back into the golden days of 2006 as EA prompts you to create some account with them in glorious 1024x768 default resolution. You'll navigate treacherous options menus the likes of which have never even heard the words 'PC Port' before. You'll set the game difficulty to 'hard' and wonder if it makes a lick of a difference as you sleep through the tutorial. Your screen will whizz around in every direction at the barest nudging of the mouse!  -cue gory introduction cutscene to earn your M ESRB rating-  Behold! Graphics as 2004 intended them to- err, hold on a sec. Graphics as 2012 intended them to look! Your eyes will water and gleam with delight as upon your screen plays out visuals the likes of which early World of Warcraft could only aspire to possess (and probably achieved by Burning Crusade, I don't know, uncle Nax never got hooked on that WoW stuff, no siree). Your soft, gooey, colorful character springs out of a mound of corpses like some necrotic phoenix, ready to bop, slash, level, traverse custcene wheels (thanks, Mass Effect), and slog through menus as the RPG gods intended. Your Oblivion-playing friends are gonna be so jealous!  From simply turning your camera to navigating your inventory (and I get the feeling you'll be doing both of these things a lot), everything is designed with a controller in mind. Wanna grab that loot on the ground? F to interact, but left click 'take all' or no dice. Pop open your inventory with the I key, then click around to get to your gear submenus. Wanna don that sword? Better left click then push enter, or right click and choose 'equip.' Just clicking stuff won't do, that's too complicated!   Walk with me now, back, back. We'll step into an era with invisible walls and tight corridors, to keep the player engaged and never you mind that wooden slope that clips into the rocks and which is inexplicably uncrossable. You'll pull a lever which dumps a corpse into an incinerator, which will then thump endlessly in there until you walk away. Why's it there? Immersion! Will you see something like this again? Nope!  Walk with me, walk further back. Further back? Yes, brave reader, we're braving the nineties and before! From the first few glimpses of action, we are beset by features etched far into the history of games and television alike!  Stock sounds!  Marvel, as the giant rats you encounter make -that one pig squealing sound- that you've heard a thousand times before! Behold, as the magic IEDs the immortal elves plant on some pillars explode with -that explosion sound- that you've heard from 1994 Doom's rocket launcher! Truly, we are living in the future.  We go any further back, and Uncle Naxza's gonna have to get unborn, so we'll stop here.  To put it simply, Amalur looks and acts dated from the word 'go.' It's an obvious, poorly-done PC port of a game made combining just about every generic RPG gameplay element of the past ten years, taking strong inspiration from modern MMOs and Bethesda titles. Areas are linear (even after you get out of the tutorial location) and lack any immediate distinction. You are pretty much 'the chosen one' living out your power fantasy of ripping up bandits and glorks and whatever else as you walk from idle NPC to idle NPC, waiting with punctuation marks above their heads for some brave hero to solve whatever ailment. The enemy AI is trifling (take four guys that stare at you and bob around while one of them winds up an attack, or bum rush the guy ahead of you while he makes threatening gestures for eight seconds), which makes even 'hard' difficulty feel like 'laughable' difficulty if you've ever played an RPG before.   And then there's the stock sounds. Call me a stickler for soundwork (and the music seems okay, if you excuse the predictably percussive battle drum music), but I lose faith in a title very quickly when it starts using stock sounds. I don't know, it's lazy. We've heard these sounds before, and if you're trying to make something new, or different, or stand out, using sounds that we've all heard before isn't the way to do it! I'm sure soundwork is expensive, and you don't need unique sounds for every facet of a game, but I don't know, maybe the sounds that don't feature in every cheap action flick/TV drama.  Harsh? Yeah. Premature? Maybe a little, I only have an hour and a half playtime at this point. First impression? Strongly made. Not good.  Buy the game? No. Buy the game on sale? Maybe if you're out of other RPGs to play (is that possible?) or you've never really played a third person RPG before.
3295	0	a	had it on consol and was not a fan.
3296	0	a	I honestly don't understand the fandom for this game.  This game doesn't look that great. This game has a massive and empty world which gets boring quickly. This game's combat system is shallow and overhyped.  Personal opinion: 2/10
3297	0	a	Feels like just another MMO. 10/10 - IGN
3298	0	a	Kind of cute, but just too silly to be taken seriously. A failed attempt at an MMO whose studio's collapse is a matter of public record.  Sad.
3299	0	a	The FOV is total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's so close to the character that you cant see whats going on around you. THERE IS NO WAY TO ZOOM&lt; NONE AT ALL. Fighting 5 things at once? Good luck, you can only see two of them at a time. Windows Widescreen fixer is a joke, doesn't work and hasnt been updated in 2 years. Also tried 'flawless widescreen fixer' Acutally made the FOV closer..I nearly threw my monitor acrooss the room. There aren't any helpful forums and the few that are there are from 2012.   The most disapointing part...it would have been an amazing game if the FOV wasn't so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing close. I just couldnt get past it. Ruined it. Luckily with the sale i only paid $5 because it's worth about that much if not less.  UNPLAYABLE.
3300	0	a	Remember Fable? This is basically a dumber Fable. R.A. Salvatore, as a pal recently put it, is the 'Dean Koontz of fantasy.' My god the writing in this is trash. I could forgive this since you are able to skip all of the stupid conversations about Tolkein and magic Elf wizards and whatever, but the gameplay is extremely shallow. There's like nothing to do except wander around, mash buttons, and be bored at everything.    If you're like 12-years-old or an idiot, you might like it. Otherwise don't even get this boring piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on sale. There are far better rpgs out there.  Seriously though, R.A. Salvatore is a complete hack and this game is like a single player WoW. So. So. Bad.
3301	0	a	completely worthless. combat is a joke. mash 1 button over and over, and decimate every nemy you ever run into. there is no difficulty, the graphics look like fable 1 quality, the dialog is forced and badly written, and the voice acting is in general complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. quicktime events pop up left and right. if this game is on sale for 0.99$ then buy it, otherwis dont bother.
3302	0	a	Not enough dickwolves.
3303	0	a	shamless knock off of dragon's dogma
3304	0	a	Played a few minutes and got horribly bored . â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
3305	0	a	this game is not fun or interesting. it's unfortunate .
3306	0	a	This game was so freaking boring. Wish I never bought it, even for $10.
3307	0	a	i was playing this and the first boss i fought i couldnt even finish him. it told me to push F but it wouldnt work. can i get a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing refund or something . its like when you buy a game you exspect it to work longer then 20 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing minutes. fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t already. Whoevers job it is should be fired because there doing a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ job.
3308	0	a	If you get the collection with all the DLC and such, be aware that the Weapons and armor bundle is 100% worthless. That DLC give you weapons/armor at the level of the first character you play. So it all spawns at level 1 and is ineffective by level 5-10.   The game has the least interesting story possible, you don't need to read anything. I honestly don't know what the game is even getting at and I am pretty far in I think.   I feel compelled to finish the game just because I have invested so much time already.  The fighting is ok, nothing to write home about.  I struggle with whether or not to recommend this, but I am going NO simply because it is an MMORPG, without the MMO. (So it is just an RPG? No, seriously, if you've played an MMORPG like wow where it is like 'Go here get this come back' it is identical to that)
3309	0	a	Not even worth the 4.99 i paided for it when on sale. It's a pile of sterotypes and cliches in a mishmash yet some how boreing pile.
3310	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning starts of as a fun to play RPG with some nice features but lacks the quality that most RPG's have.  The stealth in this game is very unneccesary. Although a stealth kill looks cool, it's just way faster to run and slash your way through.   Having said that, the next big issiue with this game is it's difficulty. Or better said the lack of it. This game is incredibly easy. I started off at normal difficulty, but I cranked it up to the hardest really fast. Even then you can take a few hits from the bigger mobs without dieing. Even though these hits are really easy to dodge.  As you can see I played this game for a few hours and I can recommend it too anyone who considers hisself/herself as a casual gamer, but for the hardcore gamers among us this game is just too easy. The fun started to flow away after 20 hours. I've been trying some other builds to see if it was any better, but without any luck.  I'm not recommending this. Keep playing Skyrim will be my advice.
3311	0	a	Aagh! Why does EA require an email and login just to play this game I bought!! This is an atrocity.
3312	0	a	This game is not worth your money. It is poorly balanced and it's more up to luck than skill wether or not you will become a wet stain on the ground. Combined with a louse save system this adds up to a lot of frustration. The idea of the game is good, and I do like the way you can specialize in several schools (mage, warrior and rogue) and pick skills from all three schools. But it's poorly implemented into the gameplay.
3313	0	a	An OK action RPG. The begining of the game is actualy very enjoyable but the game soon becomes flat and dull with too much generic filler content and a lack of variation in the combat. 
3314	0	a	It's fun for a while, but it gets powerfully repetitive. It just becomes the same thing over and over as the game goes on. It's pretty, but in an 'MMO' sort of way, where every model just comes in different colors, and divided up into zones with one or two distincitve features. It feels like a really well done single-player mod for an MMO. It's not bad, but I've tried four times to finish it, and I get bored every time.
3315	0	a	It has a huge bug that does not allow you to complete the game. This bug is well known but has not been fixed. Keep that in mind if you purchase this game!
3316	0	a	Repetetive and Boring.  For me, the story could grip me in the demo, but it takes quite a while to reach the next point of the main story and on top of that, the side quests are boring. The fighting system doesn't get much verity in fighting, just be houdlum and smash everything.  Everything just takes ages to achive and is boring at that.
3317	0	a	Many hours of gaming to be had here but much of the quests are fetch type and boring. The main quests along with faction are ok. Sometimes the camera angle is quite bad in combat but this happens rarely. Id say if you can pick this one up at a low price then its worth it. There are many, many quests in this game.
3318	0	a	I really wanted to like this game but I just couldn't.  The problem is that it's really generic. It doesn't really offer anything memorable at all. While I suppose whatever or not  you  will enjoy it remains the quetion. But after trying my best at getting into the story I just really can't see much of value.  To sum up my personal experience:   Bland story   Bland characters   Tedious and boring combat after a while   Generic abilites/skills   Generic items and equipment    There is a chance you will like it more than i did.  And if you really are into single player RPGs you might actually like it. But i personally felt like the game fell short of what could have been, and compared to other RPGs it's not that much it offers.
3319	0	a	If for whatever reason someone out there would like to play a MMORPG, but without the 'multiplayer' and 'online', this is the game for you.  Also the field of view is balls.
3320	0	a	Starts off strong but quickly loses its allure. The combat is fun and unique at first, but the inability to switch weapons mid-combo removes absolutely any level of depth. The combat wants to be Devil May Cry, but it's like they forgot to finish programming the combat half-way through.   The characters are entirely unlikeable, and the game tries to force-feed you lore through them at any moment that it possibly can. The story's forgettable, especially when you stop and think, 'Why am I helping these people again? I don't like them.'  The world is technically 'open', but the leveled mobs may as well make it entirely linear on that front. As well, there's really no point in the world being open, since past the vistas that they front-load into every new area, the world feels completely dead and drab.   The game also lacks a deal good deal of polish in certain areas. As an example, if you're using a ranged weapon and fighting an enemy who is uphill from you, you will attack the ground in front of you instead of attacking towards the enemy that you're targeting. Often, when this happens, your attacks will fly through the ground and clip out of bounds until the animation finishes.   Ultimately, Kingdoms of Amalur, falls short everywhere that it had potential to shine. If you can get it cheap(and I mean really cheap) and you're willing to overlook a good deal of flaws, it may be worth your time.
3321	0	a	Was this game supposed to have excellent narrative from some impressive famous author? The first hour or so of dialogue is one of the most stupid things I've ever seen in a professionally made computer RPG.
3322	0	a	I liked the game in the beginning, but I started to hate it over time.  The game feels like an uninspired mmo. The talent tree is very bad. You have to walk a lot, back and forth, like, there is a quest that have a locked gate and to open, you need to deactivate 4 things in the map, and this things are very very spread across the map. Some quest you have to traverse the world just to talk with a npc, and them it sends you to another far far point of the world just to talk to another npc. A lot of the map dont even have enemies, and when it does, its the same enemy variety. Some skills take time to cast, like 4 seconds, and are interrupt when you get hit, this inside an action based combat that is like god of war, so, guess if this is frustating or not. The voice acting seens ok, the history is ok too. The combat is functional but there is some problems, is awkward to dodge, the actions are queue when you press the button, making the combat feel unresponsible some times, dodging is a pain in the a**, you have pretty much to do it preemptively, also the skill and abilities are lacking, and the magics does not scale with the attack of your weapon, my staff was very powerful and my normal attacks done more damage then my main spell, making it useless. Also the inventory system is very bad, you have to backtrack to a city to sell some things, over and over again, and there are not many npcs that buy things in the map, you have to travel to specific cities, so if you are in a quest, you have to destroy your excess items or backtrack a lot just to sell some things in a far city.  They had the tech needed to make an awesome game, but they failed in every important aspect of the game design.   I was very excited for this game, but sadly I didint liked it. For a cheap price you can have some fun, but ultimatelly I don't recomend at all.
3323	0	a	---World The game world feels small, but there's plenty of side quests for people like me who shun main quests in RPGs. Despite all the action, the game is heavily lore-based. Amalur is a side quest lover's fantasy. It is a shame that the story is not particularly worth paying attention to.  ---Gameplay Save often (every 30 seconds or so) because the controls are clunky. If you see an attack coming, but the PC is already performing an action, good luck trying to cast cancel.   The fact that all mobs spawn in groups means that if you get hit once, chances are you'll become stun-locked. Hard difficulty may be easy for might and magic builds, but provide plenty of death knells for finesse/stealth builds. The stealth system is essentially broken. If you're in stealth mode, enemies are essentially deaf and blind as long as you aren't in their narrow FOV. Even so, if you fail to kill a mob with one stealth backstab, they tend to turn around and instantly take out a chunk of your HP. The worst part is, such backstabs do negligible damage to those mobs. The worst mobs to face are magic based. Enemy magic spells are particularly difficult to dodge since most lock on to your position. It is impossible to select which enemy to attack, which is often problematic. The worst in when Reckoning mode is activated and the player character keeps swinging at an enemy that is already down. Note that my play style always involves a lot of kiting and an extreme aversion to using potions. I suspect that the game is easy even on hard if you have a build with a ton of HP.  The camera angles are shoddy. In combat, you sometimes cannot see what is happening if you are stuck near a wall. Often I run in the wrong direction because the camera pans awkwardly or because I cannot see what is behind me (the camera locks onto enemies during combat).  There is no way to toggle always running despite the fact that there is no fatigue bar. This makes it difficult to put some distance between the PC and mobs when you're trying to kite. You have to start jogging and then mash the run key, hoping that your PC will eventually start running.   The invisible walls everywhere get really annoying quickly. If you get a destiny card that replaces dodge with blink, save often. There is no console, so if you blink and get stuck you will have to reload.  The best part of the game is that you can respec at just about any time as long as you have the money. It is really easy to make money in Amalur.  ---Visuals Amalur's brightness and overexposure lends to vivid scenery and a cartoony feel. It's jarring enough that you might want to consider using an ENB/SweetFX injector.  ---Audio The music is not very memorable or particularly immersive, but at least it does not play continuously. It follows the Elder Scrolls school of musical cues so you'll know when combat starts and ends if you have the music turned on.    ---Final Thoughts I wish more RPGs had a similar combat system, but with less delay between input and action. Amalur has some good ideas, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.
3324	0	a	 Pros  Interesting story and awesome finishing moves (I love the finishing move for gnomes). Beautiful graphics. Fast travel system is nice.   Cons  Level design is plain and boring. Every landscape is bare and open and you spend most of the time just running and fighting. There are some nice spots, but the excess space between them makes it feel like forced landscape. Later in the game, detail is stuffed in so small spaces that akward camera system is blocked with all the details on the screen.  Camera system is really akward. It tries to keep all enemies on the screen, which may or may not help the player. Finishing moves will be executed partly outside of camera's view, unless you fight one enemy or enemies are tightly packed together.  Extra story elements that you may ask from NPC don't really add anything. You can't receive extra missions through them or point of intrests. After 30 minutes of game play, I just skipped everything and focused on the main quest.  'Ambush' camera close-ups are waaayy too regular. Every troll/(tribal)demon you meet will get its own 'OMG! LOOK AT THIS MONSTER AT CLOSE RANGE!'-close-up.   Other  I didn't really use crafting system. I created some potions and crafted few items, but it was waste of time because you find better loot from monsters. You can also upgrade items with gems, but that is also waste of time because all the good loot you get from the monsters.   Summary  Interesting story, boring level design, akward camera. Buy it if you like from good story and don't care about running around and fighting every 15 seconds.
3325	0	a	Starts out fun, and seems quite promising. However quickly becomes tedious and boring, making it difficult to find reasons to continue playing. Combat is overly flashy, and has very little substance to it.
3326	0	a	Having STUPID sound issued and not a single way of fixng I can't recommend this game...  I thought this kind of issued had been solved but nope...   
3327	0	a	It is possible to change the play styles you use so it wont become boring too fast but I feel this was the only thing that allowed me to continue playing. It is not very user friendly because majority of the times when completing a dungeon you would have to run back to the beginning yourself and shortcuts were rare, though it is not a problem it is time consuming. I also do not feel that the levelling system was well balanced because as soon as you get the hang of the controls it gets easy real fast, even if you are playing on hard difficulty. It was not very rich in story either. I found it to be a very generic, something you can find in any RPG and doesnt really make it stand out. The fateshift feature is pretty much a berserk mode, which is very overpowered and very easy to fill up. Not only are you overpowered on your own it also alows you to use potions to temporarily increase your stats during combat and also permanent boosts known as twist of fate. To summarise it is a very generic RPG game.
3328	0	a	Everything about this game is just pretty bland, I stopped paying attention to the plot after a half hour, which is really sad for an RPG. itemization is poor, I spent 7 of the 10 hours played using the same weapon, which was a 'green' quality weapon which for some reason was better than some blue or purple weapons I found. The music was forgettable, as were the characters that I ran into, the world, and the writting/dialouge.   The combat isn't bad, but it lacks a lot of options you would normally expect to find in games like this. You have a melee/range attack button and a magic attack button and that's about it, melee combos act the same nearly every time with the same weapon and in the first 10 hours there were 3 attack spells, 1 of which was worth using. There are some other melee abilities if you invest in them, but they never appeared to be any better than just using a normal 3 hit standard melee combo.   This is essentially a single player MMO, with a more active combat system but without a lot of the things you expect from MMOs, but at least there's a lot of quests and a bit of grinding, so if you're into that, this game will give you some good play time but otherwise I can't recommend this.
3329	0	a	Awesome design, interesting storyline. However, after a couple hours the game get's way to easy with no real challenge even on the highest difficulty and it can get boring very fast. Never got to complete it, it's worth too much for a game like this.
3330	0	a	interesting combat for a few hours, but then it gets repetitve. Some reviews have compared it with God of War-esque combat, and i got fooled. But i don't play RPG's strictly for combat so which brings to the next point.  Quests are just uninteresting, I couldn't care enough to finish the game. It felt like a chore... it's shame, but because it seems like a lot effort when into this game.  
3331	0	a	The game didn't age well. It could've been a good game to play when it was released, but nowadays it's ugly, it's repetitive and the story, even though it has it's upsides, isn't appealing enough, in my honest opinion. I feel that I lost money by buying this game that there were so many people saying that could rival Skyrim.  A little disapointing.
3332	0	a	THe game has an interesting combat system and would acutally be fun ... if it was not completely overloaded with sidequests to the point where I simply gave up because I felt so swamped that I had no fun playing anymore.  A linear questline with some sidequests is fine, I even love a ton of sidequests as long as they are structured in any way but as it is here you pretty much can get a quest from every second npc wandering around. They should have put those gazilion quests onto a notice board or something so you can pick those single quests all at once. Also the quest-tracker needs to be a lot better in a game with this many quests. Maybe creating chains would also help instead of single 1-3 step missions.  I bought this game on sale, so not much money lost, still I regret the buy a bit.  In the end, do not get me wrong this can be a very nice game, the combat is interesting, I like the style and it has a lot of audio content (pretty much everything is spoken so there went a LOT of effort into this part of the game - even if some of the actors sound royally bored) ... BUT and this is a big but: this game is only for you if you have a massive amount of time and like running in circles to finish missions for days on end and do not get frustrated by overwhelming amounts of go-there-kill-that-come-back quests. If you are looking for a game that you can go up against for a really long time, pick this one up, if you like even a resemblence of structure (and I am not talking forced lineare gameplay, open world is fine as long as there is some structure that keeps you from getting totally lost) skip it.
3333	0	a	I picked up Kingdoms of Amalur with high hopes from the reviews and screenshots. It looked pretty and promised things like an open world, a well written interesting story, and dynamic combat. Sadly, it was bland and left me with a bad taste as it failed to deliver on many of those promises.   Impressions
3334	0	a	How would I sum this game up ? Mediocrity at it's best. I mean the game is fine, it has all the necessary things for an action RPG, but the thing is you never get lost in it, the game doesn't suck you in as other games in this genre do. I just didn't feel that pull to return to the game, to find out what happens next.  I've played a few action RPGs - Mass Effect 1-3, Witcher 1,2, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, TES: Oblivion, Skyrim and all of them made a much better impression on me.  The strange part is I can't actually point to one single thing that is wrong or broken in this game. I said it in the beginning - it's an ok game. But maybe that's it's downfall - it's just ok, it's kind of bland, nothing that stands out. It ticks all of the boxes for an RPG but never excels in any of them.  It's a forgetible experience for me and I jumped to other games very quickly. Compare that to my 100+ hours in each of the Fallout games and you can see the difference.  So would I recommend this game ? Well it depends. If you're a seasoned RPG player, then I'd say skip this game. It just doesn't have anything to offer that you haven't already experienced in other games in this genre. If you the type that absolutely has to play all RPGs out there, consider this game only if it is on sale. Now, for someona who is only starting his adventure with RPGs, I think this game might be a good starting point. It has all the basic mechanics in it, it will introduce you to the concept of open world games and it will only get better once you move on to other, better titles.  I myself might pick it back up some time down the road, or maybe not. Right now there are more fun games in my catalog waiting to be palyed.
3335	0	a	This game represents everything that is mediocre. It's fun for a few hours, but after that you have seen eveything. I really had to force myself to finish this game.
3336	0	a	.
3337	0	a	A game made from the dream of a baseball player who loved World of Warcraft so much he wanted to make an MMO that was better. He failed, barely getting the game out before losing the whole company. This game is the last ditch effort of the only game the company made to at least have their product played. That said, it feels like a MMO that no one else is playing, tons of loot handed to you as if you were intended to share it, large environments to run around in by yourself, etc. I didnt like it, which is sad that peoples lives were ruined over this game. It would have been a cool MMO.
3338	0	a	What we have here is a game about an unlikely hero with a semi-interesting plot set in a kitchen sink fantasy world. It's basically an R. A. Salvatore fantasy novel equivalent of a Role Playing Game, in the sense that it's really pointless to suffer through unless you are a fan of the genre with more free time than it would take to experience all the better offerings out there. Why? Well, for starters Kingdoms of Amalur is basically a single player WOW clone. This isn't a bad thing by itself, and it might even be a selling point for many (and I thought it would be for me). However, it really doesn't work. First, there is a limit to how many fetch quests and kill quests and how much stupid narrative you really can suffer through by yourself before it all starts feeling like a drag. Second, the world, while immense, also feels like a desolated patchwork of ideas that just never comes together the way WOW's world does. And lastly, the game's mechanics just don't come together well, leaving you with a lot of trap build options and over-performing weapons/builds. I haven't sunk enough hours in to finish the game (my guess is that I'm probably at around 25% mark so far), but what I've played so far really doesn't make me want to go back for more. Uninstalled, and not recommended.
3339	0	a	I regret for buying this game :/
3340	0	a	Boring. The fighting is boring.
3341	0	a	Tips for noobs:  ~ Skills ~ -Alchemy, lockpicking, persuasion, and stealth are useless skills. -Up to 5 levels of each skill can be found or bought in the game (6 with DLC). -Detect hidden should be invested in immediatly. I've found Purples and Yellows in hidden chests. -Blacksmithing is incredibly OP. -Fateweavers reset all skills. Use this to maximize your training potential (You can be too overleveled in a skill to train it) -Mercantile is excellent for early game. Once you have 2mil+ gold, reallocate those points to something worthwhile.   ~ Combat ~  -Bows with the 7 charged shot ability can one shot bosses when fired at close range.  -Invest early in +health/second gear. This keeps you from overusing health pots.  -Weapon damage stats may be misleading. A Dagger with 30 phys and 30 piercing will read 60 damage. Another dagger with 20 Phys, 20 Piercing and 20 poison/5 seconds will also read as 60 damage. -Use Reckoning often; it's quick to recharge. Combine with experience potions for exponentially more exp.   ~ Misc ~ -Quests are black and white regarding moral choices. These have little repercussions. -You will outlevel the available gear considerably. -Many zones and quests will be skipped. -NEVER repair via a blacksmith. Always use repair kits, it's astronomically cheaper this way (even with 0 Blacksmithing skill) -Explore early. This aids greatly when fast traveling from redundant quest to redundant quest.  -You can buy back EVERYTHING you've ever sold in the game. Only sell to the Fence in Star's Camp. That way you can buyback anything you want (even if you stole it) if you choose to respec.
3342	0	a	Very well made game for what you get. To me the world does not feel alive. Fighting on the game was the worst part of the game but also the biggest part of the game, whenever you attack and your attack is enterupted you basically have to wait for your charactor to recover and for the enemy to stop beating you. The game on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 5, it is not for everyone and i would not have continued to play if i hadnt paid my hard earned money for it.
3343	0	a	Unimaginative and often constricting gameplay got in the way of my interest in the world and the story. After a little over 20 hours of completionist-style play I felt like progress was a chore and just stopped playing. Plus the still-present minor technical issues didn't help either.  Full review here:  http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2015/09/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning.html 
3344	0	a	I'd advice people not to buy this game. It's just not up to par at all with other RPGs.  It feels like everything's just a shell... I've played F2P MMO's with much more oomf to hitting things and doing things.  Games like these would REALLY need the combat to make you feel awesome, but here it feels kinda bland and superficial. Your hits don't feel like they're doing much. 
3345	0	a	This game had so much potential but there's something a bit off about it. I still can't point it out yet but it's a good RPG to waste 10 or 20 hours with but still I wouldn't recommend it.  Pros - Skill system is just pure AWESOME!  - Great crafting system - Combat is quite enjoyable  Cons - Voice acting. Try it and you'll see. Not bad and not good either. Maybe and just maybe this is the one that is really off in this game. - Story isn't really that interesting - Not immersive at all (I can literally kill a whole town and the next town wouldn't mind at all and tell you that's just one reason) - The monsters you'll be encountering are the same one except for the names from the start until the end of the game - Graphics (More of a personal taste)  I really just bought the game to show support on how this game could have been a ton better than it is now. I know the studio is gone and everything but We'll never know.
3346	0	a	Ugh. I really wanted to enjoy this one - creative and original game world, interesting lore, lots of quest variety - but holy hell is it tedius. Evocative of soul-crushing MMORPGs, there's just so much pointless â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to do in this game - you quickly become overwhelmed with quests, side-quests, mini-quests, areas, sub-areas...â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. No more. I'm done with games that have their map littered with icons and things to 'do.' If you enjoy running errands, you'll enjoy this one. If not, you may trick yourself.
3347	0	a	The Story:   I found out about this game after doing some late night googling on Salvatore. 20 years ago I started reading his books and was amazed that I completely missed the fact that he worked on a game and it immediately went on my wishlist. The main story was okay, I don't really have any complaints but I didn't really feel any Salvatore coming through and I am unmoved. Anyone could have written/helped write the world and I wouldn't know any difference.   The Art:   Simultaneously I found out Todd Mccfarlane had some play in the art and I have an entire box of Spawn comics. My favorite childhood artist and writer together for one game, holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The color is great in the game but the lack of detail is mind boggling. Todd put so much detail into spawn comics and seeing character models without fingernails was just disgraceful. The graphics and animations are rather plain and nothing here is an artistic achievement. At one cutscene I recall a female soldier being shot in the back with an arrow and I think they tried to animate blood coming out of her mouth but it just looked like it was pouring out her face. Mediocrity is the theme for the art.   The Gameplay:   Through and through this is a single-player MMO action rpg. You could take any free to play mmo, remove the multiplayer and nothing about this game would outshine any of the uncountable amounts of games in the genre. Pretty much each zone has a town, each town has npcs with exclamation marks giving out fetch and kill quests. Each zone is linked together by a passage. There are basic tradeskills with the classic WoW style herb gathering, jewelcrafting , blacksmithing (except the last two you get regeants from chests and not nodes) and you don't need to invest in any of them although healing potions are the end all-most powerful item in the game as you can just spam them like Diablo 1. The skilltrees are decent, on par with something like diablo 2. The combat is mediocre to bad for an action game but better than an RPG like Skyrim. The main storyline is about 12 hours long and 'literally' 70% of the time you will be walking from one point to another like a really bad mmo, 20% of the time you will sit in inconsequential conversations and 10% fighting. The final boss was terribly boring/uninspiring/unchallenging and the entirety of the game was not challenging except at one point my main quest enemies became red (as opposed to neutral level enemies that are yellow, just like any mmo) and they were mostly unkillable. I went back to the surface leveled twice off yellow monsters (the 'open world' monsters scale to your level) came back and walked through the rest of the game without even trying.   Verdict:  Theres a lot of game here.. You could put 200 hours into fetch and kill quests if you wanted to and you can respec your skills as much as you want. If you (like me) have a history of playing mmos and you have no desire to grind out fetch quests ever again for the rest of your life just avoid this less than mediocre ftp-single player-mmo action game. If you have never played an mmo, or you love fetch and kill quests this game is ripe with them for many many hours.
3348	0	a	When someone says 'Jump!' the response should be 'How high?' not 'Wheres the part that lets me jump?'
3349	0	a	Gameplay was alright, but hindered heavily by what seemed to be issues with the difficulty being stable and potions not having a cooldown.
3350	0	a	You could honestly mistake this game both graphically and the way they construct the world as a good rpg made 10 years ago. This doesnt mean that if you like old games youll like this, it just means that it overall is pretty uninteresting in every aspect and is not up to date with good world design.  EDIT: After reading some of the top positive reviews for this game, theres something I feel needs to be clarified about this game. If you have never played a good rpg before, this game is awesome. If basic RPG features wow you, then youll be amazed by this game. If you have played any other RPGs, this game is not for you.
3351	0	a	I don't understand all the fuzz about this game. Bought it in a promotion with all DLCs for like 5bucks but even so it is not worth it. I had fun the first few levels but it got old very quickly. I finished all maps (including DLC) in nightmare+5skulls and the only feeling I have is that I wasted 30hours of my life. Most of the levels, namely on nightmare, are more a game of 'find-out-the-only-strategy-and-loadout-that-works-in-this-map-lol-screw-fun' than a real game. In a lot of maps there is only a winning strategy - not a balanced game for different types of playrs/loadouts.  If you want a tower defense / shooter hybrid get SANCTUM, not this pile of crap.
3352	0	a	I won this game in a bet, I'd wished I lost
3353	0	a	I feel bad killing those orcs, but then I remember, they were trying to kill me.
3354	0	a	No built in key bindings. Big convoluted mess to try to get the game working with your own key bindings. On top of that, you can't even have a controller or something your PC THINKS is a controller plugged in to make it work correctly. Not worth the time and effort when there's a ton of other games out there to play. If I hadn't gotten this in a bundle (not to mention hadn't spent over 2 hours of game time trying to get it to WORK), I'd refund the heck out of it. This should not be acceptable. I can't believe how many positive reviews this has. It boggles the mind.
3355	0	a	Mouse sensivity is a big problem for this game. Very hard to control the character and camera often. I did not find a satisfactory solution to keep mouse under control in the web. God luck for you. If you ignore this, it is a great game but almost unplayable for myself. I finished all levels.However, I do not recommed this game ...
3356	0	a	I had difficulty getting into this, especially after having playing Orcs Must Die 2 co-op with a friend. Many of the levels, it seems, require you to run back and forth between two different entrances. In co-op this works marvelously (10 of the original maps can be played in the second title in the series), as each player can hold an entrance, calling the other when things get hairy. The number of weapons and traps is also less than the second game. Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, but at the very least, perhaps this review will be helpful to others who are tempted to visit the first game after trying the sequel.
3357	0	a	It's an action Tower Defense game. You place traps then you help shooting monsters down before they reach the goal.  Buy the second one. Skip this one. The second even has most maps from this game, and has co-op which is missing here. Feels more like an incomplete and simple game.
3358	0	a	The lack of ability to respec or refund your upgrades really hurts the game. One of the most fun parts of games like this is experimenting with different strategies and different weapons, so the fact that you can't do this at all very much takes away from the fun.
3359	0	a	Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game, but I say it's inferior to the sequel. The lack of multiplayer is especially disappointing here. I wouldn't pick this up unless I've played through the sequel and still feel like I haven't had enough.
3360	0	a	Tower defence at its finest, intuitive gameplay and a lot of replay value. The only reason this is getting a negative review is because at this point you're better off buying the sequel OMD2. It has everything this game has and more.
3361	0	a	Orcs Must Die is at its core a tower defense game, but in 3D, with a below average FPS element. If you are a fan of tower defense games, I'm sure you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of the game, since there is a lot of content.  If you are a FPS gamer however, you'll probably get bored very quickly, as I did. Orcs Must Die was probably never intended to compare to 'real' FPS games, and as such, the combat, difficulty, and enemy diversity and adaptation is lacking when you compare it.  It's really annoying that you can only recommend a game, or not. If you are tower defense player, Orcs Must Die is amazing value. If you are an FPS gamer, Orcs Must Die is disappointing.
3362	0	a	The game is uber fun but good luck getting it to work. On multiple machines it just starts to a black screen and shows a sword icon. Common issue and the game devs don't seem to care.
3363	0	a	It's taken me 8 attempts but I'm finally about to beat this level with no enemies making it through the ri-  *game crash*  *uninstall*
3364	0	a	Could be a great game if it was a mobile app. but it's not
3365	0	a	Gets boring waaaayyyy too quickly. Don't know why it has such a high score. Look, it's an interesting concept but just not worth it.
3366	0	a	I really want to love this game, but I cant.
3367	0	a	It's fun until you realise it is just a regular horde game and you can't really combo the traps together very much. Just get the sequel.
3368	0	a	i dont know, but i didnt found something special in this game
3369	0	a	It's a worse version of Sanctum with orcs.
3370	0	a	The control scheme is straight up awkward and I don't know what it was designed for, but I can tell you it wasn't meant for controller or kb and mouse. That alone ruins what would otherwise be an uninspired, repetitive tower defense third person action game.  There's much better out there.
3371	0	a	Orcs must die!2 buy that one. Steer clear of this one. It`s so much inferior.
3372	0	a	Got old real quick, like most games of its kind. Pass.
3373	0	a	An okay tower defense game. Gets boring very quickly, but to be honest I really dislike the genre, hence why I might be prejudiced. If you like tower defenses, ignore my review, otherwise I recommend to pass on this one. It's just building traps and watching enemies walk into them and die. Sure, the game provides some challenge, but the gameplay itself is just setting up traps as quickly as possible and shooting some enemies from time to time.
3374	0	a	Unplayable for me as performace is very very bad. Even the menus are slow and jerky although i can play OMD 2 no problem so not recommended. Get the follow up.
3375	0	a	this isnt a tower defance game, this is a hack and slash game with 2 weak weapons with an idiotic loud mouth duchbag charecter.  traps and defences are useles and weak, and too expensive to buy or update.  money is too low and hard to come by.  way to hard and repetative to eaven bother. and there is the occasional crashing.  nope.

3377	0	a	Not fun.. When you start it's already hard without a turtorial only how to press buttons.. The game is too fast and i can't aim.
3378	0	a	Very boring
3379	0	a	Spent about an hour with it. Read how good it was in the reviews but this got way too old way too fast. Bought it on a sale so it wasn't that big of a deal for a dollar. I've spent more on worse.
3380	0	a	I emailed Robot Entertainment to report a bug in the game because some creatures didn't die when they landed in lava. They simply said to buy the sequel because they didn't want to release any more bug fixes. Avoid like the plague.
3381	0	a	This is a great, really fun game. Do yourself a favor though and get Orcs Must Die 2. It has everything this game has (including most the maps) and a whole lot more.
3382	0	a	That was a nice game but boring as hell. Sequel is much better.
3383	0	a	Yet again, this is NOT a recommendation. More like a warning to steer clear and spend your money elsewhere on more worthy titles.  The game has some very nice video's that hype the game up to levels if completely fails to reach when you finally start playing the game. And while this is not appearant at first. It slowly start sinking in after about 2 - 3 levels of this non-stop ogre killing.  To be honest, it's trying to be a tower-defence game but utterly fails at it as there are worse looking titles out there that are more fun and more challenging.  The game runs on most computers, looks nice, has some funny animations at times, but utterly fails at delivering any type of gameplay that was promised. Well, to correct myself, fails to deliver any type of gameplay that is FUN and was promised.  Recommandation is to go buy warcraft 3 and play tower defence there.  Rating 9 of 100
3384	0	a	repetitive and boring
3385	0	a	It's like Dugeon Defenders, But not fun
3386	0	a	Original, Fast Paced and Damn Addictive.  All 3 describe this game to maximum precision. It is such a fun game, hours can be eaten away form your hands playing through the extensive single player campaign. It does lack the single most important thing that would make this game more fun.   Multiplayer.  Seriously, without it, this game is bland, you want to experience the Orc mayhem with your buddies. Skip this one, go for the sequel.  WompWompWommmmmp/10
3387	0	a	It looks fun doesn't it? yeah thats what I thought too. But that was before I got it.   The concept of being able to attack yourself and use towers is nice and when executed properly works well. Orcs Must Die did not execute it well. Its problem is that if you don't attack you fail and on most every map there are 2 points the orcs come from and there are not 2 of you so you kill 1 side while the other gets through then you go to push back the other side meanwhile the side you were protecting gets up and then your at the very end of the map trying to shoot 2 ways at 1 time and it doesn't work. The only tower to make your enemys stop (at least as far as I played) is not even a tower its a KILLABLE Paladin. So unless you make like 3 of those at each side they all die. Even with 3 they die. Even with lots of support from ranged towers they die. Without using them the enemys move too fast and your towers can't hit them for long enough to kill them and you die.  Another big problem is that they tryed to make too many towers. You get a tower after each level and they were probably running out of ideas and were just making stupid things. What I really don't like is that 90% of the towers have almost no difference except look or wether its on the wall or the floor or the ceiling. And alot of them just push the orcs so they are only usefull in certain levels where they can push the orcs off the level. Also the ceiling mounted ones alot are useless because the level will have too high ceilings and they won't hit anything.  It was fun for the first 8ish levels but overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend you go buy Sanctum 2
3388	0	a	Nah. It's not a terrible game, but it's clunky and awkward. Micro-managing the camera angle is half of what you'll do when playing. Go look for a better tower defense game.
3389	0	a	Worst of money it just work for week &amp; its going to stop working people, this game is a mistake any mad man who buys orcs must dead is going to Acer of Yo any one who going this country Ok!!!!   :- v
3390	0	a	ERROR:Failed to load 'shaders\FixedFunctionShaders.ShaderLib' Engine will not run.
3391	0	a	Didn't do it for me at all. Part of the joy of tower defense is watching your little machine devour enemies. I didn't enjoy running around inside the machine in some kind of mediocre 1st-person shooter. This made the game less fun for me.
3392	0	a	I'm not a huge fan of tower defense games to begin with, so meh. In this style, Dungeon Defenders was far more enjoyable.
3393	0	a	Felt like this was more of a game to be played on my Smartphone then PC.  
3394	0	a	I played a few hours and got bored.
3395	0	a	Life is too short, Don't waste it.
3396	0	a	Fun idea for a game but i'm finding it to be very glitchy. The opening cinematic freezes after about the fourth word the old man says and the third level refuses to load.
3397	0	a	Definitely not one I'll play very often; but then I'm more about startegy &amp; tactics than brute force.
3398	0	a	Orcs Must Die is one of my least favorite games. I think this would be a great game if it was sort of like Torchlight II. You really need a pet or an ally to help you. This game reminds me of an old game called Lemmings. It was impossible for me to prevent the Orcs from destroying everything. I never could master the gameplay. The demo was fun to play. The rest of the game was a nightmare.
3399	0	a	God dammit, you can't remap the keys AT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING ALL. Even at the sale price, I want my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money back.
3400	0	a	Unfunny; floaty and inaccurate gameplay; and forced mouse acceleration.
3401	0	a	This game is all about killing orcs with traps, no big deal.
3402	0	a	Poor controller support and lack of autofire made playing this game physically impossible for me.
3403	0	a	Happy plus ONE.Less in an hour,think I'm not that naive.
3404	0	a	Tedious garbage. I could have eaten at Arby's and been laid up with food poisoning for a week, and still have had a better time than I have with the time and money I have invested in this. I don't want a refund, I wish I had never played it.
3405	0	a	â˜‘ Nice TPS Defence Trap concept â˜‘ Good price (2â‚¬) in Biedronka Store  â˜’ Only WSAD â˜’ No Tutorial â˜’ More shooter then Defence Tower â˜’ Sanctum series are much much better then this one â˜’ Very difficult

3407	0	a	I like dugeon defenders better than this game
3408	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
3409	0	a	The sequel is better in every way possible. Avoid this.
3410	0	a	While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws. Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two. Pick one, devs. Difficulty or ease. As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables. In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly. So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!? Why can't we simply rely on weapons? Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other. You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps. Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.
3411	0	a	buy number orcs must die 2 if you want to join friends
3412	0	a	really fun game but i cant get past the first wave becouse  1: MY COMPUTER CANT LOAD THE PLAYED MODEL SO IM A FLOATING CROSS BOW 2: MY GAME CRASHES (sometimes even my computer) WHEN I CALL THE FIST WAVE 
3413	0	a	This looked like it might be a good game. Bought it, and spent an hour in the menu trying to get it to work. Mouse won't show up no matter what I did. Tried every forum and fix I could find.  To bad. :/ 
3414	0	a	Why continue to propagation of the wide misconception in our society that orcs are intrinsically evil and therefore must be slain. It is this kind of hatred propaganda that we need to have removed from our society and place out of reach of the impressionable minds of our youth.
3415	0	a	I don't know.. if u have friends to play with u should buy this but if u dont dont buy...
3416	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  A few things that it does it does, decently.  This game, and its successor, in my opinion, were attempting to ride the coat-tails of the highly anticipated, and much more highly refined, Dungdeon Defenders. It is a poorly coded, excessively bland, tacky, generic FPS tower defense crossover. The DLC may as well be called 'EZ-mode'.  the voice acting will grind on your nerves, the enemies are so stupid.... its indescribable. They said they would come out with some multiplayer component (i.e. WTF THE GAME YOU WERE ATTEMPTING TO COPY HAS THIS AS ITS 3rd SELLING POINT, WHY DID YOU NOT INTEGRATE IT?) that would be DLC, but saw that there was enough demand for it that they would just crank out a sequel. That is the kind of developers you are supporting by buying this game. Yes Dungeon defenders has an excess of DLC, however they are still supporting it, this game has been left in the dust less than a year after it was released. The developers should feel shame.
3417	0	a	In a world where Renegade Ops didn't exist, this might be a solid title, but it does, and so it's kinda lame. Being saddled with that horrible 'we're hedging our bets' proto-Origin EA account stuff that they shoved onto every possible game for a few years (which means a net hiccup can silently eat all your progress by logging you out! the saves require you to be online!) does not help a mediocre-at-best title feel any more fun.
3418	0	a	Gatling Gears would be GREAT if the game wouldn't get stuck almost constantly. You kill the enemies in a given area, and you're prohibited from moving on to another area because you can't proceed to the end of the level due to the fact no enemies are spawning. The enemies you need to kill before you can proceed with the level. You have to restart the level when this happens and play through again in hopes that the game will actually let you beat the level. But usually what happens is that I remain stuck at the exact same point or at a different point altogether.   The game just isn't playable and I've yet to find a solution to the problem.
3419	0	a	For me, this Shoot'em Up lacks of that 'chaotic' feeling of the genre. Is a little slow for my taste and poor on the variation of the situations so is very probably to fall on monotony. Have some customization for your ship and challenges to take on but nothing special to recomend it.  Requires EA activation.
3420	0	a	Its good fun, and not too hard. The only problem I have is the game getting stuck at a point (for me, the end of the first level on Katharsis) with no way to progress. It seems to be common and it's quite frustrating.
3421	0	a	I just can't finish this. It's slow, boring and no fun at all. I think there are about 6 worlds (with several acts each) and I managed to finish 3 worlds of them. The acts are each about 15 minutes long. And it's just shooting. I can enjoy a mindless game from time to time but this is too much. Twin stick shooters are not for me I guess. The fact that you can upgrade weapons and your mech doesn't help either. It's still not incentive enough for me to keep playing.  Aaaaand... deleted.  [Rating: 67/100]
3422	0	a	requires setting up an account with EA (ï¼â€¸áƒš)
3423	0	a	..and another EA activation CRAP -&gt; never played it, but instantly deleted local content, dmn.
3424	0	a	Requires origins to play. Don't buy it, it's a trap!
3425	0	a	I'm seriously dissapointed.  Expected a lot more than just a console port with no story at all - unless you count oneliners on pictures after each chapter. Oh, and don't hold your hopes up for pictures either - you get one per chapter &gt;.&lt;  It's good for instant fun, but gets tedious after a short while. Feels more like a chore than a game.  Also, needing to have EA Something account (Origin, or whatever they decided to call it this year) and needlessly long activation process is an additional minus - like this game needs any more.  Upgrade system is very basic, on 90's level, and doesn't even provide info on upgraded parts other than 'more damage'/'more health'.  Unless you really wanted to play this and waited for the game like I did, avoid it like a bad joke.  If a friend gifted it to you thinking he's doing a good deed, buy him a drink and forgive his foolishnes.
3426	0	a	I very much enjoyed Shank and was really looking forward to playing Shank 2. I was very much disappointed.   What I liked
3427	0	a	You ever seen a film you thought was really special and then the sequel comes along wanting to be bigger and better, and completely loses all the charm of the original? That's this, unfortunately.   I wanted to like this game more. I really did. And let me be clear; this is not a terrible game by any means, and if you enjoy beat-em ups, you'll probably enjoy this. That said, if you loved Shank 1, this is a sequel that pales in comparison to its predecessor, to the point that I can't recommend it.   What's Improved  -Visuals are great, with some improvements over the previous edition. -The addition of interactable scenery and weapons are a nice touch that add a fair amount to the game. -No apparent censorship in the steam edition requiring tinkering on the player's end to restore the content like in the first game. -The one button input for picking up healing items is generally easier and less finnicky. - Decent enemy variety. - Collectibles offer an element of exploration now, though the rest of the game's design hinders this.  What's Not Improved/What's Questionable  -The dodge mechanic is now mapped to the right joystick, which requires some rather awkward hand positioning at times relative to the original Shank. I found it less intuitive and clunkier overall, though your mileage may vary.  -In some ways the level design flaws of the previous game are even more apparent here. Sometimes lethality won't be apparent to you beforehand, which can be aggravating given the new consequences for death (loss of grenades and picked up weapons).    There's less wall climbing/running, so you won't be getting as much of that parkour/Prince of Persia feel.    Scene transitions are absolutely the enemy, and it encourages a sort of trepidation that runs counter to the pacing the game wants. It's impossible to tell when the game will arbitrarily prevent you from going backward, thereby cutting you off from healing items and the newly-added point orbs and collectibles.   Further, the yellow point orbs will frequently drift offscreen while you are locked on a combat screen, and given that they fade away in a few seconds, will ultimately be lost through no fault of the player. Also, more than once for me, cutscenes triggered near healing items, causing them to be missed due to forced scene changes.  -Aiming projectiles is still frustratingly inexact sometimes.  -While the scenery weapons offer some nice variety, the overall selection of standard weaponry in the campaign is smaller now, and the Loadout System prevents you from fluidly switching between weapons on the fly as you could in the first game.  -Checkpoints are far fewer and do not persist between sessions. Got frustrated on a boss and quit? Be ready to do the whole level over.  -Explosives now cap at three, and every time you die (be it your fault or poor level design -- rest assured both will happen), you lose some automatically. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it may be offputting for fans of the original.  - Bosses, in addition to lacking the character of their predecessors, aren't as puzzle-oriented as they were in the previous game. They're not bad for what they are, but now they feel like bosses in every other game.  -Story and presentation probably suffer the most. Yes, the visuals are nice, but gone is the grindhouse/kung fu revenge flick vibe in favor of a more scattershot presentation. Shank 1 felt unique. Sadly, this does not. There's no overall solid theme or feel this time. Whereas the previous story was a simple but well told revenge flick which revealed more as you went (moreso before the developers came back and cut content, causing plot holes) with clear and familiar film archetypes, what we have now is a weird Rambo-inspired mess where you will have literally no idea who any of these characters are, why you should care, or what's going on unless you read the bios in the main menu. It's the sort of tell-don't-show thing you'll find a dozens of other games.    The story in the previous game added quite a bit to the experience and, despite being simple, was tighter and better told than in most games, but that restraint is gone now. Here, the story in this game does absolutely nothing and gives you no reason for investment. If that seems like a weird nitpick for a beat-em-up, know that I only mention it because Shank 1 did it so well. In keeping with this loss of uniqueness, Shank's new voice, while perfectly servicable, now sounds like every other growly video game protagonist, something which, given the character's lack of motivation this time, doesn't help things.  To conclude, this game, while not terrible by any means despite the above, is sadly a quintessential example of a sequel that, in trying to be bigger and better, loses a lot of the charm of the original and winds up taking a few steps backward.  
3428	0	a	Shank was one of the best games I've ever played. The combat was intense, the controls were fluid like water, the music pumped your adrenaline and even the storyline was engaging. Everything about it was amazing. Shank 2, on the other hand, is a shining example of exactly what you should not do with a sequel. It was as though they took everything that made the first one great and said, 'let's do the opposite of that!' The combat is frustrating, the controls are different and clusmy, the music is repetative and the storyline ranges from cliche to cheeky to downright bizarre. They even changed Shank's voice! He sounds like a putz now. I don't understand how a developer can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up their own game so thoroughly.
3429	0	a	Shank 2 is one of those games that seems to think the best way to make a sequel sell is to take everything that made the original great and throw it out the window. The boss fights are awful, the weapons aren't nearly as fun to use, the enemies aren't as fun to fight- but really, the worst thing is the controls. Original shank: move, weapon, weapon, weapon, jump, block. Shank 2: those, plus dodge roll, sprint, and counter. Shank 2 seems to think that for a good sequel, you need to add a bunch of gimmicky crap. All a sequel needs is a fresh coat of paint. Exhibit A: Portal 2. I think the best way to put it is this: It's rather liked getting bopped on the head once ($9.99), given five cookies (Shank,) then bopped on the head again ($9.99), and promptly kicked in the shins (Shank 2.) Don't get kicked in the shins. Keep your ten dollars. Go buy Subway sandwiches for yourself and a friend. It's valid sustenance, you'll develop social skills, and you won't repeatedly pound your head against a terrible for a bad decision. Assuming you don't add mayonnaise.  Shank 2's Final Score: 5.75/10 Letter Grade: F Verdict: Worse than mayonnaise.  Mayonnaise's Final score: 6.0/10 Letter Grade: D- Verdict: At least some people like mayonnaise.
3430	0	a	Don't expect a deep plot. This time Shank guides you through eight episodes of brainless action: no effort in enhancing the game experience, the controls are good only if played with a controller.The violence level is so off-the-charts to the point it will put a smile on your face...As long as you don't fall asleep while playing. A survival mode - with an offline/online two player option - is the only thing added from the previous title, it's also easier in comparison to the original Shank.  In short: it's a brief and dull game. Play it only if a crazy amount of gore, beefy guys and explosions doesn't grind your gears (the cutscenes are somewhat enjoyable).  Machete anyone?
3431	0	a	This game is nothing but a ragefest. Its pretty and interesting but all the weapons do the same move all the finishers are the same and all boss fights are is ur ranged weapon and a lot of dodging me personally i rate it down it looks good but plays kind of bad so its a no for me...
3432	0	a	a total downgrade from shank 1, terrible controls, cheap bosses, only new features are gimmick weapons (like a turret you're going to want to switch to mouse to control decently) survival mode and an enhanced pounce + gore (only on male enemies, because equality i guess)  story is also a mess but it's not like the first one was hamlet  just play the first one again instead of wasting 10bucks on a survival mode
3433	0	a	Fun game however controller is required to play this! I do not care what it says you will not be able to play this with a keyboard the handling is terrible.   Cool Art Dumb Story Terrible on Keyboard Fun with controller once you buy one.
3434	0	a	the game gets VERY repetitve once it gets to a point... the story is lacking in almost every way and is painfully dull, and fr a game seris with canabals, a mistical amazon women that shoots lightning at you and all the over the top violance, youd think the story would aleast be over the top, but sadly it feels out of place and oddly safe for a game with so mach madness behind it. gameplay is hard to get the hang of at first, then get fun and frantic, but then becomes repetitve.  even with its great animation and its ideas...shank 2 fails to keep you in for long.
3435	0	a	I want to recommend this game I really do, however the controls are awful, range of motion is cardinal directional and the responsivness of said awful controls is even worse. I don't mind that fact that it's tough hell I like tough games, when it's the game that's challenging. I don't like a moderately challenging game that is made hard by it's horrific controls. The original Shank was great, the controls were all there and made sense. This one however... using the thumbstick to dodge,  why ? OK they removed block that's ok with me, but that block button was how you initiated a dodge, so now they muddied up the game play by forcing you to have to pretty much play with your right thumb over the stick to dodge at a moments notice, which 90% of the time will fail horribly or not even respond. I will still give a pro and con list so you might use this review to help you out.    Pros:   -The animation in this is much nicer and smoother -Same violent slash fest as the first one -Editable load out pre-mission/player's death (there will be deaths)    Cons:   -Responsivness? What's that?  -Lacks intuitive controls. -After the time I spent it still feels like I'm playing the same stage. -360 degree world? No we only have North South East and West in this world thank you very much!  As for KLEI check out their other games, they really are a great company, I loved the original  Shank , and  Mark of the Ninja  was superb. I haven't played  Don't Starve , but that looks pretty interesting as well. They also have another game in the works, just look them up I don't work for their advertising department so I'll leave that to them to give other details.   So in short I don't recommend this game, but honestly if you loved the first one still give it a shot, the controls might not bother you as much as they did me. I only wrote this to give people and idea of what to expect. If worse comes to worse; download the demo. Take Care.
3436	0	a	This game is in a lot of ways better than Shank 1. There are a lot less 'cheap' deaths, although a lot of the enemies themselves pull some pretty cheap/unblockable moves. The result is that most deaths in this game feel a lot more justified than in Shank 1.   The original game's controls were dumb enough - it required 12 buttons to perform all actions, completely ridiculous for a fighting game with such a shallow combat system. This one is even worse, with 14 buttons required. They added a dedicated 'pick up/use' button, and added 2 (!) dodge buttons. These add absolutely nothing to the gameplay, but make it so that you have to map a couple controls to the right analog stick... really really stupid. Do you want your dodges to require you to move your thumb from attack/jump controls? Probably not.  They mostly got rid of the QTE type boss fights from Shank 1. Boss fights in this one involve shooting your guns A LOT, maybe 300-500 hits kills a boss. They feel more like Mega Man bossfights than fighting game boss fights. When EVERY boss gets to half health, you can grapple to trigger a short cinematic.  Presentation wise, this game is quite a few notches below Shank 1. What little story there was there is pretty much eliminated here. Cutscenes are quite poor quality, and some of them look like they were hand drawn, scanned to 720p and then stretched poorly to 1920x1200. The game takes place in south or central america, but all voice actors sound like they're white game developers from Seattle. The drop in quality makes me think the budget for this must have been a step down from Shank 1.  Due to less cheap deaths, I'd say this game is better than Shank 1 by a hair, but still pretty poor. The controls are stupid and overly complicated for such a simple game, the combat system is still pretty much button mash with the occasional jump out of the way, and the presentation is almost non-existent.  I WILL recommend Mark of the Ninja, don't be scared off of it because of this, but by the same token, don't by Shank thinking it'll be the same quality as MotN.  
3437	0	a	Might be fun if the controls weren't so tedious and the gameplay so dull. I completely see the appeal in a machete-like game, but I feel like this REALLY doesn't capture it correctly. Go play any other of Klei's games and you will have fun, this, not so much.
3438	0	a	They really fâ™¥ â™¥ ked up the dodge controls compared to Shank No. 1.
3439	0	a	Shank 1 was better. Shank 2 has more bells and whistles but feels watered down. Basically, has a change in art, gameplay and controls that not everyone will like. (and a lot of people dont.) I think voice acting also is worse here. When I played I always had the feeling that the game was targeted towards much more... younger players than Shank 1. Its difficult to backup this up with an argument though, but it's like the whole game has sunken. To make the whole game worse but to add a mini game where you have to defend against waves of thugs. Why? And those constant hints... oh god 'press ... to grab ...' 'this is water, dont go there. its wet. fish lives there.' etc.
3440	0	a	Pretty much the same game as the first with different weapons. The story, like the first, is rather dull and doesn't really make you care about any of the characters. On the plus side they varied the enemies up a bit more and the stages are more creative. Co-op is a nice addition but doesn't add enough to make me care.  Pros: - Gorgeous Graphics with very appropriate hit boxes for the most part - Variety of characters and weapons  Cons: - SAME GAME! Seriously, it's the same game. If you didn't absolutely 100% LOVE the first one, don't get this. - Boring Story - No reason to use anything other than the chainsaw and knives (other weapons don't have alternative benefits)
3441	0	a	If you liked the first Shank game, be wary of this sequal. While the core of the game is the same, what they added is not enough to make up for the subtractions.  The controls seem to be a little nicer with the ability to stop combos and such, but the ramped up difficulty on 'Normal' can cancel out that ability as it seems there is always a new wave of enemies (always including a ranged mob) that will knock you out of the combo.   Boss fights, as well boss fights. We all know the jump, dodge, attack and repeat nature but this time they liked to add in atleast 2 more random baddies to the equation. It's bad enough I need to jump, duck, dodge and roll and then attack the boss but adding more random crap in to the experiance doesn't make it 'hard', it makes it tedious.  If your looking for the sidescroller, try the original Shank or Mark of the Ninja, both a much more enjoyable experiance.
3442	0	a	It's a nice throwback to old-school brawler games, with great looking cartoon graphics. Unfortunately the gameplay gets repetitive fast, and the difficulty is not designed well, random points in levels will get extremely hard, with the rest being relatively easy, even the boss difficulty varies. Gets old fast when you have to retry certain areas a few times. It might just be me, but I play simple cheap games like this to kick back and kick some â™¥â™¥â™¥, not for a 'challenge' because I'm a 'hardcore gamer'.
3443	0	a	this game fails at being a good hack n slash fighting whatever the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ its supposed to be. thats because the dodging system sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, since enemies attacks got stupid super tracking, grabbing and pummeling is more of a suicide thing to do since enemies can hit you freely while you do that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and you can easily find glitches that break the stage progression forcing you to start ALL OVER AGAIN (if youre playing in hard mode)
3444	0	a	This game has an intriguing story, nice graphics and fun boss fights. BUT,  its really in bad taste when it comes to a Klei game. The controls are wobbly and the gameplay is the same basic gimmick. Dodge and counter-attack. If it wasn't for the constant waves of enemies you have to fight, it would be a much duller game. As for replay value, it serves no purpose in going back, unless you're an achievement hunter. There would be no way of going back to this game aside from playing survival mode with your friends. Which gets pretty lame after the first few rounds. Would not recommend if it wasn't on sale. 4/10
3445	0	a	While it keeps most of the mechanics of Shank, Shank 2 is ruined by the need to carefully block opponents instead of building awesome combos like in its predecessor. This not only messes with the fluidity of the game, but spoils most of the fun as well. It's a shame too, because it could be a very promising title. Would not recommend unless you are very much into defence driven action. If not, the first Shank will keep you more than satisfied.
3446	0	a	Great art direction and characters ...but unfortunately lame combat system which is so frustrating that I can not recommend this game unless you have nerves made of titan!!
3447	0	a	no local co-op like Shank 1
3448	0	a	This does NOT, in anyway, shape, or form live up to the first Shank. Shank 2 is just like when the action movie Taken got a sequel that SUCKS (even if you never saw the first Taken!).
3449	0	a	make more fatty and gunners then thats it  derp
3450	0	a	How do people finish these games they're so difficult ;( I can't even imagine dark souls. This games is like a really hard flash game for $10. I Got this in humble bundle so i'm not dissapointed. The game play is fun only the game is just too difficult for a scrub like me. The only thing about a few flash games. Which is they are so hard to finish. The game play is not good so it gets boring when you try over and over again. The game is just hard but pisses u off when u die non stop (not as much as some indie games) 5/10
3451	0	a	Compared to the original, it's really worse in most departments. Story is a disjointed mess, just serving as a vehicle from one stage to the next. Combat is similar to the original, but dodging is much worse (and doesn't work half the time) and hot swapping weapons is gone. Bosses are less gimmicky (compared to the original), but are just long, boring brawls. In general it's 'like' Shank, but Shank 2 is really a different game. Having played these two back-to-back, I can easily say the original one is superior.
3452	0	a	People seem to either love or hate this game. I fall under the hate side. I loved the first mission however for whatever reason it goes to a snow level and Boss you have to kill in a certain way without dying once otherwise its back to the start of the boss fight again. No thanks. If you enjoy uber hard challenge and little to no hand holding and little to no help from the game then this is the game for you. If you enjoy rigid and only way to kill certain things then this is the perfect game for you.   The game is not for people who get frustrated easily. As you will die a lot and then die a lot some more.
3453	0	a	Note: Skip straight to the bottom after Pros and Cons for tl;dr. Note 2: I also have not played the first game. This review examines the game from its story as a standalone. Note 3: I also have no one to play co-op with. This review excludes the co-op part.  Pros:  - Responsive combat - If you have a controller, use it. It feels excellent.  Cons:  - Typical story, replace damsel with older damsel. Also the story makes me cringe. But that may be just me. - Relatively short game if you play on normal - Combos? What combos? Maybe I'm just bad at this game, I dunno :(  Shank 2 is a game that is not for the story-driven. As a guy who loves story-driven games, this is a game that just... what? That's not a story man. Shank 2's story doesn't feel like a story - it feels like filler for the game's mechanics, which are solid; not revolutionary, but solid.  It's hard not to keep a negative tone about this game because I didn't really enjoy it; I was soon playing it for the sake of 'finishing' the campaign. However, the game's combat is very solid (that's a third) and it felt great to play with a controller. Sometimes the combat makes me feel as though the situation was out of my control, but those moments are few and far between, and it was actually me not being alert most times.   Overall, I don't really recommend this game, but for reasons that may not ring with you. If you like playing a game purely as an excuse to whack baddies, this is OK. But for people who are story-driven and like a good campaign, stay away.  TL;DR: Get this game for an excuse to whack some baddies; platforming combat is good here. Stay away if you like good stories and a long game, regardless of the gameplay.
3454	0	a	It's the same game, only marginally worse. Here's some beat-em-ups I would like to see instead:  - An Edward Gorey-style beat-em-up where a young Tim Burton travels in time to the future to assassinate Present Tim Burton (Johnny Depp is the final boss) - An adaptation of Edward Abbey's Fire on the Mountain where the grandfather puts on a gi and goes to town on encroaching government agents - Drunk Fights: A two-player game using the Euphoria physics engine where two incredibly drunk people fight each other in a bar (special characters like Charles Bukowski are either DLC or unlockables) - Christmas Drunk Fights: see above, except it takes place in a shopping mall - Sudden Ninja Attack: Like The Sims, but there's NINJAS that you have to kill with your superior reflexes
3455	0	a	I don't know if this game is good or bad because I couldn't play it. Do not try to play this game without a game-pad. I couldn't get through the tutorial. Try pressing d L and shift, and use the mouse. If you can your an octopus. I couldn't so this game was rendered unplayable.
3456	0	a	Despite the fact that I absolutely loved Shank 1, I have to give negative review. Trust me, I tried. Emulating gamepad,changing controls for over 30 min. First of all controls are absolute garbage, you'll find dodging only to te left side and different control bugs gamebreaking. Because of that fact I wasn't even able to win first level of the game. Because of that I can't really review different aspects of the game. You are probably thinking 'Well gamepad maybe is broken, but what about keyboard?'. Who would like to play fighting game on keyboard? It's bugged in the same anyway. All in all if you are planning on buying this game I'll have to persuade you not to. I had 2 attempts on playing this. First one was right after I managed to beat Shank 1 on hard difficulty. Decided to go with the flow and I got gifted this. Now after few years I thought to give this game one more shot. Like said before, fighting over controls then with enemies. Great way to ruin the series. I'll probably buy Shank 3 but at least I hope they'll fix controls issue.
3457	0	a	When I picked up Shank 2, I was hoping for some old school platforming and hack 'n slash. The screenshots gave an impression of a brutal and fun game.   Alas, I found it far more focused on picking off hard combos or accomplish certain area stunts than to get from A to B and kill the boss. It's focused more on being a hard old school game than entertainment. And instead of experimenting in various ways of killing your opponents you are stuck with throw X there, or beat Y to death here.  I do applaud the developer for the games beautiful graphics, and the idea behind the game.  As well as the multiplayer aspects (as long you find someone to play with). But as I said, I was hoping for something more open and less restricted game.  :Game Quality: 3/5 :Controls: 3/5  :Effort: 4/5 :Re-playability: 2/5
3458	0	a	Do NOT buy this game if you dont have a gamepad. It is almost unplayable on keyboard.

3463	0	a	A bit better than the first game and if you liked the first game, this will certainly be better. If like me you didn't quite find the first game bad or good, you won't find Shank 2 memorable enough to suggest a recommend. But it's better, I'll give it that, and totally better if you did like the first game, once again. But here's my opinion.
3464	0	a	Easily one of the worst games I ever played.  Bad animation (running consists of two shapes) Bad coding (huge fps drops in some regions) Bad control (X-Box port) Bad gameplay (some bosses are frustrating, the rest just easy) Bad story (if you can even call it a story) Bad mechanics (tons of unlockables) Everything else (unskippable cutscenes, savepoints set too loose or every few steps)
3465	0	a	Another one that I'm neutral towards. It was okay, but not worth buying.
3466	0	a	DONT BUY THIS PLAY SHANK 1 ITS THE BEST
3467	0	a	There is no campain coop.
3468	0	a	After playing few hours, completing some missions (not so much, in fact), I made my little idea of this game. I don't like it. Why? Because it's very repetitive, the musics are the same for the whole game, and that's very annoying to play with that dÃ¼mb music playing and playing again. But, nevermind the music, you can turn it off (Of course you can, if not, I would be god damn dead right now), let's talk about the gameplay itself. You play Shunk, or whatever, and you cut people. That's all ! You cut people with knifes and machetes again and again ! Enemies are all the same, checkpoint is a forbidden word in this game, bosses are just boring and wasting your time, etc. But at least it's pretty decent when you look at the graphics, yeah, it's all drawn-by-hand, and it looks awesome ! It 'looks' awesome. Looks.  Ups :  - Nice graphics - In the first hours, it's still fun to switch between Knifes, Machetes, Guns, etc., it makes the first levels a little more exciting - You don't need a PC from the NASA to make it work, and that's a good point if your PC is cheap. - A little coop mode, didn't test it yet. (I need to find someone who likes this game first...)  Downs :  - Musics are... BLEH. - Too repetitive - Enemies are all the same - Bosses are full of bugs, and seriously not interresting - The story. I don't understand anything about this 'conflict' or whatever. You maybe need to play the 1st game before playing this one.   I do not recommand it, but I cannot spit on it, I had fun on this game !
3469	0	a	play a newgrounds flash game or something
3470	0	a	Campaign is 3 hours long (well Shank 1 wasn't long either). Although there are some unlockables, most of them are grind based. Fighting is well done, but boss fights are just simple fights with evading. Shank 1 had some strategy and tactics in boss fights. Based on this, I would say Shank 1 is better game and this one shouldn't be bought (story isn't even that interesting) without discount. And no one plays co-op.
3471	0	a	Game was so boring it actively kept me from installing Mark of the Ninja when I was done. It's like one of those beat-em-up flash games, right down to 'your character follows your cursor' tracking that results in janky movement. Coulda totally done without levels full of ninja nurses who all had an identical voice.  I didn't dig it.
3472	0	a	+ Good art style + Fortunately, it's not that long + Well-balanced difficulty + Good feeling of the weapons, especially the scythe - It quickly becomes boring - Uncomfortable controls - OSTs without any kind of style/charm - Cheap boss battles
3473	0	a	Luckily that I got free play for this game, and I got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by the rocket luncher part in the last stage that I wasted 30 mins to solve it just because there was no checkpoint in normal mode for that, so I had to deal with a large wave of enemy because I die with a stupid combo rocket instant kill every god damn time. 10/10
3474	0	a	Don't bother. Mark of the Ninja is made by the same guys and is really good though.

3483	0	a	- The game is frustratingly hard. Most people (including me) died severa times in 1ST LEVEL! and it is worse from there on. - There is no strategy to learn, just repeating every frustrating level and boss until one time you luckily wount die. - Dont look for Easy difficulty setting - there isn't any. - The control scheme is a mess on both keyboard and controller. Dont buy !

3500	0	a	Controls are a disaster. Movement around the screen makes it impossibe to keep track of where your mouse pointer is in relation to your character and -- for no reason at all -- the mouse has to be on the side of your character you want to attack with using LMB. So I end up attacking the wrong direction as often as the right one. Don't even remember how this ended up in my library. Some junk bundle at some point I guess. So after a half hour of frustration, I'm just idling for cards then uninstalling.
3501	0	a	3/10  Granted, I didn't play Shank 2 for very long. I like to give games a chance and play at least an hour or two before I form any kind of opinion. But I had nothing but contempt for Shank 2 and its endless mindless button mashing! My hatred for this game has become an inside joke with my friends. Don't talk to me about SHANK 2!!! It's actually the reason I didn't try Mark of the Ninja for so long. But I must say that the latter turned out to be a fantastic game.
3502	0	a	Unfortunately, not good. The devs changed the control scheme from the original and in the process, completely broke the game's dodging mechanic (by moving it from a trigger button to the right stick). In the original, gameplay consisted of dancing through crowds of enemies, shooting and stabbing and murdering as you go. In this installment, it's just frustrating because the controls are busted and can't be customised.
3503	0	a	why? just why?
3504	0	a	Poor combat: I've had enemies shoot/grab me from the wrong direction somehow, leaping move randomly misses because the enemy decides to move back a step, etc. Very frustrating.
3505	0	a	not recomended. why? 1.keyboard controls are awful. 2.even with my 360 controller still awful. i gave 2 chances.  no more. ty 
3506	0	a	Note: I only played the game for a couple hours, maybe you will like this game but I did not. It is an arcade style platform combat game with a few added features in it. It may be better the longer you spend on the game but it was not for me.
3507	0	a	One more really cool-looking game with absolutely no hardware support. If you don't have an XBox controller, don't buy this game. This isn't even a Game For Windows Live game, and it still doesn't want to play nice with my PS2-style controller, which is functionally identical to the XBox controller, just laid-out for a human hand instead of a jock meat-claw. I don't understand why developers refuse to acknowledge and support this issue. It happens with every single game of this genre since Arkham Asylum (probably before, but that's the oldest recent one I've played), and every time we're forced to hack open our ini files and fix it ourselves because nobody in the dev community cares enough to properly port their game to PC.  Shank 2 gets an F for being completely unplayable. And too bad, because it seems like a lot of fun.
3508	0	a	Where do i even begin with this awful game.The controls suck the difficulty is near impossible especially when the mahince guns dont work when there are hordes of brutes runing your way.Its like the developers didnt even test the game b4 they released it. I thought shank 1 was a bit shabby with it controls but this is just 2 much.Dont buy this game.Its not even worth playing if u get it for free. I finished 95% of the game and than quit because the crapy controls wouldnt let me use the machine gun that u would use to kill the waves of brutes running your way. 0/10 worst game ever made i'd rather give a homeless guy on the street 10â‚¬ insted of buying this excuse for a game. DONT BUY IT.
3509	0	a	I borderline hate this game. After about 30 minutes, I was so frustrated and unhappy with my experience, I almost uninstalled it and hid it from my library. I was too stubborn to do that and ended up beating the whopping 2.5 hour campaign, though I'd hesitate to say I actually enjoyed any of it. Thank god I got it in a Humble Bundle.  My biggest problem was the difficulty. It's a bit too hard for my liking right off the bat, then ramps things up a bit more each level... until you get the shotgun and the game becomes 'mash shoot to win'. I mean, I guess I should thank the developers for making it so utterly overpowered or I probably would never have beaten the game. Unfortunately, the plot isn't much better. It's your standard 'retired hero gets thrown into the middle of a conflict and defeats the big bad' affair. The first game (which I also didn't really care for) had a much more interesting plot, but that's more thanks to Quinten Tarantino due to it basically being a poor man's Kill Bill.  All that being said, I can see how some others may find enjoyment in this title. If you like hard-as-nails beat-'em-ups with copious amounts of gore, then this is for you. I guess I'm just too soft these days.
3510	0	a	I love the original Shank. It's a fun brawler with a good story with over-the-top â™¥â™¥â™¥-kicking.  Shank 2 improves the gameplay in some areas and downgrades it in others, but the main problem with this game is the story.  Pros:  -The dodge button was a welcome addition -Adds more fun ways to dismember people, like throwing them in the air and shooting/slicing them -Forward attacks involve more charging forward  Cons: -A bit too tutorial-heavy -There are way too many enemies to defeat. It makes the game not fun and more of a grindfest. -The story is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. In the first game, the story was straightforward. Shank=good guy. Everyone else=bad guy. You kill bad guy. Also some backstory, but mostly that. In Shank 2, you rescue your mentor/girlfriend and it's pretty dark and gritty. No. The story in Shank should just be him going around and killing things. I don't want to deal with moral choice in Shank. I just want to dismember people. Also, Shank apparently has a daughter? This is wrong for a couple reasons. One, Shank is a terrible role model. He runs around getting drunk and killing people. Why should he care if he has a daughter? Two, Shank is such a badass that giving him a moral compass takes away a lot of that. It's like giving the Terminator a family.  Conclusion: Shank 2 is more of a gritty grindfest than the over-the-top popcorn action game that the original Shank was. If you prefer a more complex story, then buy this game. I personally think that the story should complement the gameplay, and the original story did that a lot better. In Shank 2, the story and the gameplay don't match, and it detracts from the experience.
3511	0	a	Those on Windows may ignore this comment.  I want to love this game. I really do. As a fan of beat-em-up games, I can't complain about the gameplay itself. The combos are easy, and the game itself is challenging.  Unfortunately, playing this game on Linux with a 360 controller is basically impossible. On the menu screen, right maps to up for some reason. The dodge input doesn't work, the RT and LT buttons do nothing. While I had similar issues with Megabyte Punch, that game at least gives you the ability to change your controls. In Megabyte Punch, you select the command you want to change, then press the button you want to change it to. Simple. In this game, I don't even know how the control changing works. I click one control option, and it always changes to either Y or Z rotation.  It's too bad. Maybe if I ever own a Windows machine I'll try again, but for the time being I'm going to be avoiding this game and the original.
3512	0	a	I stuck in shank 2 after elena was put into a container cannot grab the ladder to go down
3513	0	a	I've only gotten 42 minutes into it and know I've played similar games that did it way better.   Kinda clunky, very repetative, not the greatest art style and story.
3514	0	a	not much shanking i met more shanks in prison than this
3515	0	a	cheep game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off
3516	0	a	Boring game. - Little variety - Each level is more or less the same - Boring story
3517	0	a	Short campaign. Too many cutscenes. Bad story.  my rating: 2/10
3518	0	a	I really wanted to love this game, it has so many cool elements to it. Ultimately the controls are clunky and frustrating, the dodge roll is pointless, enemies do too much damage, and bosses make for pointless tedius frustration. I like a challenge, but not when I'm battling my controller.
3519	0	a	While I liked the first Shank I had problems even playing the second game for the cards. The whole combat system is overhauled making it frustrating to play. They removed blocking and replaced it with dodging and countering. Dodging is put on the right stick which takes to long too reach when you are having your thumb on the attack buttons. The countering is done with the same button as you grab with. The problem with this system is that it works really bad when facing large groups of enemies. You will die a lot because of that. They also put more focus on the story which is really bad. A simpler story but acceptable story like the first one worked much better.
3520	0	a	Shank 2 is an old school beat-em-up of the sort I thought were obsolete. It turns out, I was exactly right. Shank offers nothing new or interesting in terms of that genre, yet is demanding, repetitive, and consequently tedious. Thereâ€™s also a surprising amount of sexism and racism to boot.
3521	0	a	Okay so I gave it a positive review before, but now that I have played a bit in hard mode, I can honestly say that the good things about this game do not outweigh the bad things.  It's poorly optimized and unnecessarily difficult and slow compared to the first game.  Take it from me, buy the first one instead.
3522	0	a	Nice looking fun game. But the controls are really bad. Not worth the dollar.
3523	0	a	Fun game, but the Boss fights are such a worthless waste of time. Boring. repetitive. And with lame Mechanics. I'd play alot more if the boss fights weren't garbage.
3524	0	a	Enjoyed Comicstyle Graphics every second but can`t recommend it  The combat system really sucks, there`s little to no way to protect yourself. WHY grab an enemy to make a 'stylish' attack when you can be hit by ALL other in that time. Shooting enemys are the ONLY danger in most levels. If you like good graphic style and simply mashing buttons until reaching the checkpoint then buy it. IÂ´d rather put the money to a novoline gambling machine  How did the makers of 'mark of the ninja' mess up like that ???
3525	0	a	This seems like a fun game but every time I attacked, my character automaticaly faced the opposit direction I wanted him to face. I don't know if it was a bug or if a setting wasn't set correctly but it was frustrating enough to not want to play it.
3526	0	a	Shank 2 is only a big disapointment. A complete downgrade from Shank1. And I really enjoyed Shank 1.  But Shank 2 is 'heee'. The cutscenes are terribly awful. It really hurts the eyes. The animation are very bad and the voice acting is only a joke. Every cutscenes is a bad-joke, and really takes you out of the game. Ingame also the animation are poor.... The whole visual experience is not very pleasant also ingame. The level design lacks of every kinda form of imagination and aesthetic. The colors are fade. The sound design is as bad as is the music... And the controls are wobbly on windows and sucky on linux. Managing a turret with the gamepad is impossible so you have to jump on your mouse to control it decently. Bosses are cheap and have a poor patern move system. You can kill them all only using your guns. Survival mode is funny for sometimes with a friend and will bore you after a short period of time because it's lame.  The support on steamOS/linux is very bad. Performance are terrible. It seems than a gtx980 on a i7-5960X is not enough to run the game smoothly. It lags a lot, perf are about 15fps on many occasions ( everytime it rains it's barely playable ). The controller support suxx, specially if you use a xbox360 controller. Who on earth use the start button to grab or the select button to pounce?! Changing the layout is buggy. Y'ou'll have to find out by yourself how to trick the bug since there is absolutely zero technical support from the devs. And sometimes the d-pad is simply stopping to function for a few seconds, specially this will you make rage-quit. They've killed Shank by adding this sequel.... that's very sad indeed.  The only positive point, the game is hard and challenging, and the poor almost no-support of gamepad on linux makes it too frustrating. I don't really understand how devs can claim to support an OS while the support of that OS is a bad and sad joke...  Shank 1 is a great game. Shank 2 would only make you hate both of the games. I recommend you playing the first one again, even on sale that game is not worth your time and money.
3527	0	a	This feels like a point and click and i hate that if an enemy is behind you...you dont trun and press an attack button you have to click on him/herthat ruins the combat alot when it is a fast paste fighting rampage game. 6/10 recommended on xbox 360
3528	0	a	I enjoyed the first game a lot, but Shank 2 is in my eyes a game, which nobody needs. All positive things from Shank 1 are now gone.  - Very weak story. To be honest, I even can't remember the story anymore from the second game. - Cutscenes are pixelated. What they did wrong and why were the cutscenes in Shank 1 perfect? - Gameplay is boring. Because the story is weak, you kill people without sense.  Only one good thing is, that this game has an online coop mode. But I tried it out last in 2012. I would wonder if the Multiplayer is still alive.
3529	0	a	Well,this game is just the average Beat em up. But to be honest a rather bad one.The controls suck badly, its extremely hard,even on the lowest difficulty,and the checkpoints are unfair. The game is also very repetitive, since there is only 9 Weapons in total and there arent any minigames. There is (very hard) bosses tough, and some turret sections, but they are all boring too. There seems to be alternative skins ,but idk if they change the gameplay, and I will probably never find out because after the first 2 levels or so I got too bored and quit the game. If you are a TRUE fan of Beat em ups you MIGHT like it,but in my opinion, spare your money for another game!! And even you got a free key (like me,I got it from  {LINK REMOVED}  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.com) , think about installing it twice,because it might not even be worth the space.  2/10 Juggs
3530	0	a	If you are an average gamer like me, this game will really p**s you off. I have played the first Shank on normal difficulty without problems, however, this second Shank is too hard on normal difficulty. I wish they have created an easy difficulty for this game! There are too many s**t going on at the same time, you have to be very skilled gamer to press every different button on each situation. I could only do that if I sniffed cocain and took amphetamines and an energy drink. I know we can change settings on controls, but I don't understand why they have changed some buttons compared to Shank 1, that was brainless (specially if you got used to controls from the first game). There are enemies (specially the bigger ones) whose attacks are very unfair, they grab you and drain a lot of health. If I knew the game would be that hard, I wouldn't have bought it. I regret wasting my money on this unbalanced difficulty game. I didn't find this game as fun and playable as the first Shank...
3531	0	a	Note: I only played the game for a couple hours, maybe you will like this game but I did not. It is an arcade style platform combat game with a few added features in it. It may be better the longer you spend on the game but it was not for me.

3537	0	a	Didn't play the first one... don't feel like I missed a lot... this is alright, and the turret sections are fun (as turret sections usually are), but overall it feels samey and I didn't feel particularly challenged. Controls are a bit sticky. The last two boss fights are quite nasty.
3538	0	a	I can't believe the people who made Mark of the Ninja made this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The only way to beat the bosses without tearing your hair out is to just use ranged weapons. Which takes all the fun out of the game. Such a frustrating combat system that always leaves you guessing as to what exactly the developers were trying to go for in that specific instance.
3539	0	a	Beaten in 3 hours on Normal, with quite a bit of frustration along the way, mostly due to the combat mechanics and a couple bad checkpoints. Here are the main things that made the experience frustrating for me:  - Awkward combat and controls. Even by the end of the game, I never felt like I could control Shank's movement as precisely as I wanted, and half the time he and the enemies just bounced around the screen as we desperately tried to hit and dodge eachother's moves. It's just really clunky and silly looking a lot of the time. I would have liked more precision in the movement.  - Too much dodging. If you try to fight stuff straight up, you'll die over and over and over. Dodge is controlled by the right joystick, and you have to hover over it constantly and use it every time an enemy flashes yellow, charges, fires a projectile, leaps at you, etc. When you have 7 enemies on screen charging back and forth in different patterns, firing waves of bullets, and cleaving at you it's just incredibly annoying that the key to winning is to dodge dodge dodge dodge. I'd have preferred more straight up combat where I could fight something without watching 6 other things and constantly being interrupted.  - Difficulty spikes in weird places. I spent half an hour (1/6 of total play time!) on a single turret section that was preceded by a long easy section with no checkpoint. Every time I died I had to re-do the easy section to get back. I got stuck on a boss earlier in the game for half an hour, yet beat the final boss on the first try without even knowing his attack patterns.  All in all, it's not a bad game. The controls and style of combat just really annoyed me. I'm glad I finished it though and there is a sense of satisfaction you get from beating the difficult parts. The cutscenes and story are groanworthy, but clearly that was their intention. I just found it all very forgettable, whereas Mark of the Ninja was just a fantastic experience with a great ending. If you're choosing between the two, I'd definitely go for the latter.
3540	0	a	This is essentally the same game as Shank and comes with all of the same flaws, plus a few more.  Mainly, that the game just isn't very challenging and has been severely dumbed down for the casual market compared to old school beat 'em ups like Streets of Rage. Giving you infinite lives and checkpoints takes all of the fun out of this type of game. If nothing else at least offer an option to set limited lives and continues while retaining an 'infinite lives' option for casual players who are just playing it through for the 'story'.  Speaking of story, it also took a turn for the worse. While the original Shank's revenge plot was at least interesting enough to care about, the plot in this game is just generic 'B-movie' fare and makes no mention of the characters from the original at all. The settings are also a lot less diverse and interesting, boiling down to dark dismal jungle and industrial environments which are a lot less nice to look at. The added in-game voice acting is also unnecessary and for the most part downright cheesy.  Essentially the game retains the same flaws with little in the way of improvement, and a few additions that make the gameplay worse:   *Easy, short campaign, little to no replay value with the only unlockables being alternate costumes and character bios that add nothing to the gameplay  *Poorer controls than in the original (having to use seperate buttons to dodge left and right)  *A survival mode which had potentional but is multiplayer only (and with no one playing it online this mode is only accessable if you have a real-life buddy to play with)  I really can't recommend this except to casual gamers who typically play Facebook or Zynga games (and even then, the strong language and gore will probably be a turn-off to the type of people who play Farmville or Candy Crush Saga).
3541	0	a	My time with this game was short and frustrating. Not the fun kind of frustrating that the original Shank was, but the kind of frustrating where I just wanted it to end. If you have it in your library, then it's a fun few hours, but don't pick it up unless you really, really love the Shank franchise.
3542	0	a	 Garbage   While they managed to fix flaws of the first game, they also completely screwed the combat. Blocking and grappling are now on the same button. Playing with controller feels like being handicapped, since when is dodging on the right joystick? It is complete lackluster since I have to spam X, A, Y, B for attacks in synergy to dodging. A good thing is that they are giving you an option to re-bind the keys. Yet there is no free or comfortable buttons left. This is why they combined blocking and grapple in the first place. I would of been fine with this if it allowed me to bind dodging to Left Trigger in synergy with movement joystick. Simply put, controller felt like a complete garbage to this sequel while it performed good enough in Shank 1. This forced me to switch to keyboard &amp; mouse, which has been improved in the sequel. Dodging was way easier to do on keyboard, since all I had to do was hold shift and move into the direction I was going to dodge. But yet again I found a problem, my heavy attacks were on shift+lmb. So i tried to re-bind it on a mouse4 or mouse 5. Sadly those were not programmed in to the game. So without much hastle I just mapped it on my keyboard to not mess up my dodges. To sumarize my whole experience in one word, frustrating.  While playing through campaign, I found out that it wasn't really worth using meele. Since I was constantly jumping/dodging while tossing darts. This made it an ultimate weapon on hard to take down enemies. Even the boss couldn't withstand it. Kinda sadenss me to see it this way, because even if the first game had it's best equipment you always ended up using them all.   Even worse they took out the momentum of finishers. In the first game you couldn't be harmed while in the momentum, just like assassin's creed. Making it 1 on 1. Though it wasn't perfect and sometimes you still got hit by it, at least it was an efficient way of staying alive during enemy hordes. I guess it was over abused on hard mode, but heck it didn't even had checkpoints. So they ended up trading momentum for checkpoints and as a final effort we got a completely useless battle momentum.  Story wise, I can't really say it's any better than Shank 1. Voice acting is at the same degree. Enemies were all the same as in shank 1, only difference was the skins. Game lenght wise, it was shorter than Shank 1. Basically only noticeable difference was a little improved graphics.   Verdict: Worse than the first game. If they just... wouldn't... of... screwed with game controls and mechanics and improved upon the first one. This could of been a great hack &amp; slash game. 
3543	0	a	this is a game where every time you die in a boss fight you have to watch the unskippable intro 'cutscene' again unrelated note i know the entire choreography of the first boss cutscene off by heart
3544	0	a	Horrible game, it's pretty but thats pretty much all it has. The gameplay is boring, unimagniative, repetative, without any flow and all in all this is just a big stinking waste of everyones time.
3545	0	a	A regular 2D beat em up game so awkwardly balanced it's barely playable. The game is hard, but it is super tedious to get through. The first few levels are fun until the overpowered bosses get a hold of you. I would not have a problem with this if the bosses were programmed to be as strong as me and as good as me. But they are so strong I got bored mid fight. For a fast paced action game to be like this really takes away a lot of enjoyment out of the game.   A boss fight should not be about how long you punch the guy but about how much skill it takes to land the punches. I won't even go into detail about checkpoints, whoever designed and placed them clearly had no idea what they were doing. Why? Just why? For hardcore mode going to the beginning of the level is no big deal, or even mid level. But to have it even on normal is just overkill.  Play if you enjoy small burst of enjoyment and bosses with infinitely health. 
3546	0	a	This one's tough for me to recommend. It's a solid concept: you're an alien that's crash-landed onto earth, and you've been brought in for experiments in a lab on the bottom of the sea. You and a mysterious alien friend of yours need to escape. The catch is that you get this ability to warp from place to place around you, including within objects. It's a clever concept, and it looks and feels pretty good for a game that lists a usual price of $10. The puzzles are generally challenging, and some of the challenge maps are quite tough.  Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. You have to deal with stupid EA account BS every time you log in, or you can't access your save file. The story is pretty flat and not that dynamic, and from what I've heard, the game runs like crud on systems with older CPUs. There's little incentive to collect everything you find (no achievements, no end-game rewards, and the powerups you can get from SOME of the collectables don't change up gameplay that much). I really had to force myself to finish this game after spending maybe 4-5 hours on it total. It's not even that long, I just wanted to collect as much as I could.  If you're really desperate for an indie game, I guess give this a try? Otherwise, it ain't worth it, especially if you're giving EA your money.
3547	0	a	And why do I not recommend this game. EA's Origin! Never even got the game running, 20 minutes of painfull Origin create profil, login, enter game serial. Run game, login again, enter game serial once more, game crashes, start game again, login yet another time, game crashes, reboot windows, run game, login just for the sake of login in, game crash, uninstall!  Steam, would you please ban EA Origin games!
3548	0	a	Entertaining, perhaps, for a time, but ultimately underwhelming. The learning curve is basically flat for the whole game till the end, where it suddenly spikes hard. Oftentimes you are placed in a situation with no solution discoverable -- obvious or otherwise. The narrator-type character's onscreen effect is the moral equivalent of alien beergoggles, it killed me more than once. The game proper has very little depth, the upgrades are too expensive for you to ever see more than two of them (of which you will most certainly want the fast-warp upgrade).  I never seemed to unlock the swap/launch upgrade, even now at the supposed end of the game.  The 'Explode people' mechanic is trite, the violence is unecessary pandering.  Taking a large view, this game feels short, two-dimensional (in terms of gameplay depth), and probably not worth 2$, much less 10$  Strong Reject on it's merits.
3549	0	a	Can't even play the game becuase of EA, waste of 10 bucks. If you wanna take your chances and try to figure it out go ahead but i don't recomend it as it's a huge problem for everyone who bought the game via steam.

3554	0	a	Couldn't even stomach to play the game. I have an origin account and I use Origin regularly. But this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is just annoying, and the menu controls reek of bad PC port. Can't even use a mouse in the menus? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that.
3555	0	a	You have to very obnoxiously create an ORIGIN account to 'play the game,' and by 'play the game' I meant have it repeatedly crash before getting to the main menu. Don't waste your money, no matter how cheap the retail price.  PS, Why can't Value, Microsoft &amp; EA implement the OAuth protocol so we can share a single profile &amp; authentication scheme across distributers?
3556	0	a	Badly optimised, significant loading times even on my high-end CPU despite such a simple game.  As far as gameplay goes it's a good concept but poorly executed, with minimal stealthing or thinking required.  On top of that - it requires ORIGIN.

I'd tell you about the gameplay but it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing crashed when i accepted the 200 pages of terms and conditions So â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game, im going to go play some age of empires 2.
3561	0	a	This game was not enjoyable at all and I felt like I was smacking my head againist a wall because of my machosistic desire to finish games. The puzzles weren't awful and the atmosphere was okay but stuff seemed off and when enemies spotted you it seemed at times unfair and then they randomly swear at you for no apparent reason.   Not something I'd recommend to anyone.... =(
3562	0	a	This game's puzzle mechanics are satisfying. They're definitely unique, especially since a preferred playstyle can be chosen. You can stealthily get around by means of trickery and concealment by creating fake copies of things and swapping around the locations of objects, people and yourself. On the other hand, you can find creative ways to use your powers to waltz on out of every guarded room without leaving anything recognizable as human behind you. You can also blend a very functional gradient between the two. There's plenty of variation in the enemies' appearances and behaviors, not to mention humorous dialogue.  Where the game comes short isn't really a single issue. In general, it feels watered down. It's a great game in concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Puzzles lack variation. The art is nice, but it gets monotonous to walk through the same hallway for the umpteenth time. The aforementioned playstyles are enjoyable, but they're not flexible; upgrades are irreversible. To mitigate this, you'll have to backtrack and hunt for the currency used to purchase the upgrades, which, admittedly, can lead to some of the most enjoyable puzzles.  Essentially, the concepts offered potential that was untouched. The game feels incomplete in important aspects of gameplay. Many puzzles are bland, repetitive, or unchallenging. The gameplay is somewhat incompatible with the physics engine used, allowing exploits that get you to higher elevations than you should be able to get to. The game's length is short. Overall, it feels underwhelming. I really do think that this game's core mechanics are far from lacking, but it's the nuances that overshadow the parts that would otherwise shine.  TL;DR: While mechanics are creative and enjoyable, the presentation is trite and disappointing.
3563	0	a	I wish there was a way to NOT RECOMMEND games. REQUIRES ORIGIN! :(   Edit 11/26/2013 - Steam finally gave a way to not recommend games. Thank you!
3564	0	a	Neat idea for a stealth action, sorta metroidvaniay kind of game. However, suffers from frame rate issues, poor gamepad support (mine only functioned 90% of the time, which isn't enough), UI problems, and swingy difficulty curves.  It's hard to really sum up how all the little problems just add up against Warp. Small stuff like having to go back to an older checkpoint, so you can resave at your current one.  Some of the worst parts of the game for me were the optional challenge rooms, which thankfully were truely optional.  I actually ended up playing all the way to the final boss, then decided I wasn't having enough fun to want to spend the last 30 minutes to finish the janky, unpleasant fight, just to see the ending.  Really the definition of a below average game. This could have been much better with just even a little more consideration of the overall package.  Avoid this one and save your money for the next stealth game.
3565	0	a	I hate when I need to loging to Origin while I'm playing a game I bough in Steam. I did it... Now I think I can go back to play Portal - it is way better!  
3566	0	a	My video review:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HolQMp6q6A8 
3567	0	a	PC port not so great, controls are sketchy and can be frustrating. Story is meh at best. Sad really, great premise, bad execution.
3568	0	a	Uh oh, poo my pants, Warp is from EA and indie?!? Hmmm!  The floppy sloppy design and buggy wuggy mess you often run into mid-game definitely brings that indie feel across. Warp's a cool idea with the most mixed of executions, but it's mostly good. It's never terribly fun, but it's not like it's boring or anything, either. It just kinda floats around in the vacant, drooly department that leaves you staring at the screen until you finally reach the game's ending. There's no worthwhile story in Warp, so the bulk of the game should rely on level design when we're talkin' stealth and platforming, but, unfortunately for Warp, the level design remains middling, and difficulty pops up and down unpredictably.  On that note...not shabby! ;)
3569	0	a	Game looks nice but on my PC, it runs at ~15fps. Unless I find a way to optimize (unlocking fps in warpengine.ini did jack) it's $2.49 wasted.
3570	0	a	It's not Portal -- that 's for sure. Stupid people just should refrain from making puzzles. Beat it in a few hours. Challenge mode leaderboards are polluted with hackers' fake records.
3571	0	a	This game is bad. The AI is bad. The level design is bad. The gameplay is bad. The story is nonexistant. Another poorly developed EA title.
3572	0	a	This piece of crap goes with a hard lock of mouse filter (meaning coursor movement is forcefully smoothed and sharp aiming is impossible). Be aware!
3573	0	a	Warp is a console app store game brought to PC without considering the PC client base at all. Not only that but like all games sutured onto to the glutounes corporations you need to sign up for an account under another game client to play it.   Gameplay wise the puzzles are extremly simple and clearly made by uncreative people. You are never challanged and the upgrades you receive are never impressive. They try to tack on some narrative like all modern puzzle games, but that falls flat on its face in how trite it is. You won't want to purchase a soundtrack for this music score either, it's completly lackluster by all account.   *SIGH* you actually feel like you're getting dumber while playing it.
3574	0	a	Don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy it! You'll pay to get headache, not a good rest time. Technical implementation for PCs is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Pay me 100$ back - I won't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play it!  ) Rrrrrridiculous graphics optimization. Ingame graphics config is abscent.

3575	0	a	I really want to WRAP my hands around the neck of the developer of this game...
3576	0	a	I Demoed this on console and it was was fun, but this pc version a terrible port. Origin account making and constantly logging in is terrible, game constantly crashed, never got to play this download.
3577	0	a	The activation key doesnt even freaking work, this is bullcrap
3578	0	a	Horrible game. Doesnt even load, and no one can fix it. Not even the producers can fix it. DONT BUY IT IF ON PC!
3579	0	a	Should have been better...  The game clearly has something going for, the aspects about the premise in combination with the wonderful and shining aesthetics, all of that sharing a diverse and simplistic style of playing. It is a concept that i enjoyed, however, the biggest problem about the game comes just from the first minutes as i realize the game just doesn't have the options necesary for any 'pc game' to have.  My fear began as i witness only three options in the video settings, resolution, vsync, fullscreen, i could have accepted that if the game had allowed me to play or even traverse to the menus using my mouse, it didn't. Not only that but the game is locked at 30 framerates per second.  It's dissapointing to say the least, frankly the game is fun, but as i said before, it could have/should have been better.
3580	0	a	This game it a bit broken... Its not possible to set the key mapping yourself and you are forced to use the arrow keys instead of the WASD. It is bought in steam but registered in Origin (?) THis is abother EA fail game... Same for CNC4 and Mirror Edge.    4/10
3581	0	a	the game is mediocre at best, the concept is kinda cool but not worth $10 i only payed $5 cause of summer sale thank god but even then i wish i didnt buy it. The story is painfuly boring and lack of creativity and the upgrades in the game do very little. As for all the people ahving trouble with the origin account? i logged in once and played the game smoothly ever since the only thing is it said i wasnt logged in everytime i started the game but to be honest i just wanted to finish the game to see how it ended (it was a dissappointing ended obviously lol) and the save game was never an issue. I dont recommend this game because its blan and boring go spend your money on something better. Hope this helps :)
3582	0	a	The gameplay was fun but the boss fights were way to hard
3583	0	a	I'd recommend against picking this one up. The game was clearly built for the XBOX and so it doesn't control very well on the PC. Worse, is that the game, while novel, is not intuitive; ultimately you will find yourself getting through obstacles via trial &amp; error.   I like the idea of the game, but it's poorly executed and poorly ported.
3584	0	a	I would rate this as a good game, except for one thing. The graphics are pretty decent, the storyline and concept are original and attention-capturing. However, the controls are so screwed up on the computer that some sections are frustratingly difficult, and one boss is impossible. I can't recommend this game.
3585	0	a	Good Point : Fun Puzzle Bad Point : Boss Battle, really, really really HARD
3586	0	a	Can't even get in to the game since EA forces you to sign up to Origin and then forces you to log in every time you boot up the game and when I log in it automatically crashes. P.S if someone knows how to fix it, tell me please.
3587	0	a	Pros - Warp is interesting and pretty fun to play. It is also looks pretty good.   Cons- you have to deal with origin...ewww. The gameplay although fun at first is pretty flat. The game is 10$ which in my opinion is too much for a game like this. Might be a worthwhile purchase for $&lt;5.
3588	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  It's advertised as being indie. I buy it.  Cue forced Origin launch and crappy EA DRM.  So you jump through their hoops, and...  Come to a crappy Xbox 360 port with graphics that look like they came from the Playstation 2.  With no graphics settings besides screen resolution.  The keyboard controls are terrible, so you're pretty much forced to have an Xbox 360 controller. I have one that gets dusted off whenever I play Sonic Generations.  You get to uninspiring, repetitive gameplay that gets old FAST, and some of the worst boss fights I've ever played.  0/10 DO NOT BUY
3589	0	a	This game is fun, but until they actually do something about the aweful coding, dont buy it OR get it on consoll, it's hardly doable on pc as it is now, I have sent them an e-mail about this but they dont seem to care...do we really wanna support such bad service?
3590	0	a	EA has managed to lock me out of this game with their 3rd party activation scheme. Avoid this game like the digital plague. EA has managed to sucker me out of the purchase price. I'm extremely sorry I purchased this game.
3591	0	a	Inside a Star-Filled Sky is a game developed by the lone indie developer Jason Rohrer. Inside a Star-Filled Sky is exactly the type of game I'd expect to see win some kind of award at the IGF - but winning an award at the IGF doesn't necessarily mean it's a good game.   Insidie a Star-Filled Sky is a novel concept and little more. The game itself is themes around the idea of recursion where you 'enter' power ups and enemies. While this is a nice idea it doesn't really impact the gameplay that much and each item you enter is effectively just the next room. I did appreciate the power up mechanics. You can collect up to 3 powerups and they can be combined in interesting ways to produce interesting effects. This fact alone, however, is not enough to merit a recommendation from me.  As a product, the game is very unpolished and feels like a prototype - for example editing the controls involves manually editing a config file. There's also no sound effects to speak of, just some ambiance music.   There are some nice ideas here but I don't feel the developer took time to flesh them out into a compelling gaming experience and instead delivered us a rough prototype.  Score: 3.5/10
3592	0	a	Perfect example of how NOT to use procedural generation: as the content of the entire game. This is an unfinished program with no vision. Your only purpose is to pilot around from randomly generated level to randomly generated level finding better upgrades so that you can kill the enemies in the way more easily.
3593	0	a	Interesting concept and gameplay but nothing there to make you want to continue playing after an hour.
3594	0	a	If I was given a chance to refund a single game, it would be this.   There is an interesting mechanic (diving into enemies, power-ups etc.) but its connection to the game is vague at best. Going into something feels nothing more than a â€œnext levelâ€ button , thus making it easier to lose track of your progress, everything looks so similar, if not identical.
3595	0	a	This game has a super-interesting high concept to it. However, without any defined goal, it's ultimately pointless. There is no end-game. Have fun playing forever, or, more likely, stop after an hour or so and never pick it up again. This is Jason Rohrer at his Rohreriest.
3596	0	a	It's entertaining for all of five minutes, by which point it begins to feel like it has outlived its purpose. The gimmick is neat, but there's so little actual game here that it's not worth even a few bucks to give it a try. If you want a sense of infinity, go look up Space Engine or some such prodecural game with real scope- IaSFS just manages to feel claustrophobic, and since the entire premise is procedural generation, thoughtless.
3597	0	a	This game is punishment wrapped in desire mixed with hope.
3598	0	a	Frustratingly poor game design. Single idea with crap tacked ontop. Game doesn't have a menu, don't have a clue wtf I'm doing or if there are even any other buttons. WTF do flags do? Is there a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing goal to the game? No? Good, so I won't have to worry about sleepless nights wondering what happens at the end. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥it
3599	0	a	I just don't get it.  The game throws you violently into gameplay, with little explanation on what to do. There's no tutorial later on, you pretty much have to figure out everything by yourself.  The game itself is very confusing if you don't know how it works. For my part, I still can't figure out what each thing does, or what the goal even is. The art is fine and pretty good actually, but there's nothing much more to it. What a pity!  Unless you can reach out to the developer so he can explain what the hell you're supposed to do, then you might be better off not getting this game, or at least, not until it gets polished a little more!
3600	0	a	I get it, small, compact, limitless, indie. But it doesn't make it fun or especially intereseting I'm afraid.
3601	0	a	'What if you could enter an object in a level and find a level inside of it? What if you could enter an object in that level and find another level inside of that?' is basically the entire point of this game, and the answer is just that it'd be a procedurally generated game like so many other indie games nowadays, but wrapped in an attempt to make some kind of fancy artistic point out of it.  Honestly, it's exactly what it looks like, though frequently far more boring than the screenshots depict. The game is described as: an 'infinite, recursive, tactical shooter'. By infinite and recursive, the designer of course means procedurally generated, and by tactical it means you'll often be sitting behind a corner waiting for the one time you can dash out without instantly dying, or choosing to run away into a different level because discretion is the better part of valor. If you're expecting good top-down shooter mechanics, look elsewhere.  The artistic point isn't worth $8, and while it managed to bamboozle me into buying the game, I have no idea how it confused reviewers like IGN's or GamePro's, who actually managed to play the game before writing their reviews. I hope.
3602	0	a	I don't get this game... seriously. Why isn't there a proper tutorial ? I get the idea of moving to higher levels, and the fact that the higher you get the more enemies appear. But what do the power-ups mean ? How do I change weapons ? Can I even change weapons ? What's the best tactic ? How do I change an enemy from the inside ? And so on and so forth. This would've been a better game if things like that were explained properly. Also, the stylish retro graphics do make up for some of the game, but it just isn't enough. Let's hope the developer fixes some of my complaints in the near future.  [Rating: 66/100]
3603	0	a	This game has literally no point. No plot. Just the mechanic of shrinking into objects, with no real end to how small you can possibly get. And while that in itself is an awesome mechanic... it is rendered meaningless because there's just no plot. There's nothin'. It's literally just you going around shooting stuff and getting smaller.
3604	0	a	I did not enjoy this game at all.
3605	0	a	Quite a letdown, only thing i regret having in my library
3606	0	a	Of all the hipster indie trash I've played, this is by far the most pretentious and pointless.
3607	0	a	I have no idea what the point of this game is about. no story, it's only a design idea.
3608	0	a	Pointless.
3609	0	a	What this game lacks in story, it makes up for in decent gameplay. It runs well and all, however it does have a few issues:  - You must sign into Microsoft's 'Games with Windows Live' Sign-In App to be able to play the game with the save data of that said game. That is pointless and unfair because for most games on GOG, Origin and Steam; you don't need to sign into 'Games With Windows' just to play a PC game. If I wanted to play a game on xbox, I'd go and do so.   - There's no way to run the game in windowed mode, and I've checked the settings. This is a huge downer for me :( ________________________________________  Now if you can get find a way to bypass these issues, then you're golden. If you can't, then its best to avoid this version of 'The Club.' I'll leave with that to make your own choice. Anyway, thanks for reading and stay batty my friends.
3610	0	a	Good game wrecked by the Games for Windows Live â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.  A fast paced shooter with an arcadey feel to it. Simple and fun.   Buy it on sale when it's $5 or less and spend the first 10-20 minutes (or more) going through the games for windows live crap and then give it a try. if you can get it to work. I couldn't
3611	0	a	Honestly......this game isnt worth the time it takes to fix.......if it didnt take â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 2 hours to get to work it wouldnt be half bad. so if your considering to buy this. stop considering it. dont buy this game instead buy something else.
3612	0	a	CAN'T RUN THE GAME (FAIL TO FIND STEAM) â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU FERNANDO
3613	0	a	Dont run on windows 7 or higher!
3614	0	a	A broken, messy game that's near impossible to play properly or with decent controls.
3615	0	a	Just bought because i loved this game so much when it was on xbox. But now? Don't bother.
3616	0	a	I recommend you DO NOT buy this game. DO NOT buy it. You have been warned.
3617	0	a	I can't get the sound working 100% correctly in this game. The sound works for all the intro movies and cut scenes, but as soon as it goes into the actual game, no sound. Just too much of a headache trying to figure out a fix. I was hoping to give it a legitimate shot before GFWL bites the dust, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen.
3618	0	a	The club is one of the games that should be left in the ashes. This game has eight campaings for eight charecters. All of them have a story why are they competing in the club but all of the campaings stay the same. That really wastes the potential that this game had but all it is just a boring shooter. The game has wonky controls that dont feel right, the aiming is off and its hard to aim for a headshot. This game has a sport element. Bassicly all you do is run around the levels try to rack up kills and get the highest score possible and beyond the easy difficulty setting is near beyond impposible to rack up points. This game is deffintely a game you should leave there and not buy it. But if you do get a fair price i say check it out for a quick play but for the full game youre going to be dissapointed i give it a 4/10
3619	0	a	Worst animation EVER!  The Black cop character runs like he has a 2 pound load of sh!t in his pants.
3620	0	a	 **DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME AS IT DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE**  This game multiplayed ONLY, and because of Micro$ofts Game$ for Window$: Live shut down there's no actual way you can even play this game...  0/10
3621	0	a	I spent more time getting GFWL to work than playing the game. I had more fun getting GFWL to work than playing the game.
3622	0	a	If you haven't already, do NOT buy this game. Firstly, you have to jump through hoops to get it to work (read the forums). Secondly, it is a bad port -- they leave the Xbox buttons in the UI instead of changing them for PC for example. Then, once you start playing it, you realize how lacking of substance it really is.   One thing going for it is the character designs and the CG videos look good.  If you're really dead-set on getting this game, read the forums first to evaluate for yourself if it is something you'd want to go through the trouble of playing.
3623	0	a	i dont know what i expected. but a multiplayer arena game wasnt it. loaded it maybe once or twice but havent gone back.
3624	0	a	Game doesn't work on windows 7- there should be some kind of warning.
3625	0	a	Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.
3626	0	a	Both the publisher: TREK Industries and the devs: Spiral Game Studios should be permanently removed from steam. Not only do they steal assets from other devs, they have a long track record of not following through on there development promises. They try and undermind the steam review system by removing valid reviews, they changed the name of a game they never finished so they could re-release it and make everyone pay for the same game twice while abandoning their first game. I for one will never buy a game from this publisher again, not for $10 and not for $0.10. Devs that only have one release game should not be allowed to rename that game so they can release it again to make more money and cheat their customers. If you like Dinosaurs consider buying Ark, survival of the fittest is free, seriously Ark made a second game and charged nothing at all. What is your excuse TREK Industries/Spiral Game Studios?
3627	0	a	 TREK Industries:  Hi, Activision!  Activision:  What's up TREK?  TREK Industries:  Can I use your assets?  Activision:  NO!  TREK Industries: Well....I will use them anyway!  Activision:  Come back here!   TREK Industries:  HELP! Activision maliciously attacks Indie Dev!!!   For the record Activision is trash, but David Prassel is a blatant liar and a thief.  Plagiarism is never ok.   EDIT: Since I'm tired of replying to every braindead white knights that show up lately, here's the summary of the situation:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/  Read, then decide whether this 'nice' developer is worth of you defending them or not.
3628	0	a	After 3 years and 3 Steam releases, I expected an improvement on the controversial game I had heard so much about.  First released as Orion: Dino Beatdown for $15, then Orion: Dino Horde which dropped to $1, and now Orion: Prelude which has recently gone Free-to-Play. This is where I entered the picture.  I had first heard about this game with such catchy headlines as 'The Worst Video Game EVER!' and 'Is Orion: Prelude still the Worst Game Ever?'. I then saw trailers which showed the game in its new polished state and heard the feedback stating it was 'the best turn-around in video game history!'. Outside of these he-said/she-said discusions I didn't pay much attention to this game. 'It's Halo with Dinosaurs' they said, 'Nonsense!' I'd say. It wasn't until the game literally screamed 'I'm free now, please play me! It would be very nice if you would play me!'  So I did, and while a awaited the game's download I decided to research the critisim of this game. What I saw was a buggy unfinished mess, multiple instances of theft of video game assets by the developers, and radical reactions to negative feedback by the creator. But that was for the older versions of the game, right?  What I played in Prelude, and what I saw in Dino Beatdown/Horde, I could not distinguish. I really like the idea of this game and I wish it all worked, but ultimately the game lacks polish: it's horribly optimized, animations are amateur at best, Ai is atrocious, and weapon handling is nonexistant.  The saddest part is, it seems this game will never be improved because the developers refuse any meaningful critisim and/or are incapable of coding a better functioning game. They have big plans ahead, but I don't know how they can realize them if they can't manage to properly make this.  Try the game if you want, you're free to do so, but as someone who wanted to like this game I warn you of what I have experienced.   EDIT:  In light of some recent criticism I have decided to put a bit more time into this game, but my recommendation stays the same.  To put into perspective: You hear your friend talking about this guy but all he keeps saying is how much of an ***hole he is. You think to yourself 'he can't be that bad'. Then you finally meet him and the first thing he does is slap you across the face. Do you stick around to see how many more times he hits you?  This is a bad game, there is nothing objective about that. Programing is bad, animations are sometimes nonexistant, and it's difficult to run on some of the best computers. 'Can you still have fun with it?' Of course you can! There is nothing stopping you from enjoying a bad game. I myself enjoy several bad games. That does not excuse the corners that this game has cut.  There is a difference between a good game and a game that you as an individual can enjoy. Because I and many others do not enjoy this game, that does not render our opinions irrelevent.  You Are Allowed To Like Bad Games! but after the amount of time I have played I cannot recommend this game.
3629	0	a	what is this the fourth time this game's been 'released' to wipe off all the negetive reviews? if stolen art assests and the fact your money is going to a scum bag don't bother you, give it a try the games alright for $1  some history if you're intrested.   http://www.gatheryourparty.com/2012/05/04/orion-employee-beatdown/   theres plenty more if you google a bit, these guys have a track record

3631	0	a	  Weapons seem pretty weak . I guess its not my cup of tea . The concept is good but it laggs for me most of the time.   Fast paced gameplay , and much spray and pray . however the lagg-spikes make it really hard for me to play :/
3632	0	a	  It's A Trap!
3633	0	a	English (US) Look, the game is not bad ok, but the multiplayer community is pretty much dead, so... for a multiplayer only game, like battlefield, you won't have much to do, only buy if your friends are going to play with you...   Protugues (Brasil) Olha o jogo nÃ£o Ã© ruim mas a comunidade morreu, poucos ainda jogam, e como Ã© um jogo exclusivamente multiplayer nÃ£o hÃ¡ o que fazer mais, por isso nÃ£o recomendo...

3634	0	a	ORION: Prelude. Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs. The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores. Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.  The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason. Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting. Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.  Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game. Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me 'homey' one more time...)  Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde. If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars.   The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.  Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult. Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.  So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.  In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point. Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be.
3635	0	a	Game is ok. Devs are shady little children who can't handle negative feedback or make original content. 3/10 needs new dog models
3636	0	a	Stop looking at the negative reviews this game is amazing and for $1 it's an absolute steal. 9/10
3637	0	a	What can I say ? After reading all the negative comments about this game, I thought to myself; nah, it can't be THAT bad. So, stubborn as I am I decided to buy it anyway. Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much). Virtual garbage bin material. What a waste of time AND money.
3638	0	a	I'm torn. For the $1 I paid for it during the promotion, it's tons of shameless fun (I thought), and a nice deviation from the standard Killing Floor/zombie wave mods out there. That said, I have to look at this in the context of if it's worth its asking price and...  No.  The game is high production value Unreal Engine modification, but it lacks the attention to detail that makes Killing Floor so fun. Animations are janky, player textures frequently disappear mid-match (leaving behind their primary-colored models), hitboxes are off (why is a shot to the crest of the neck of a raptor considered a headshot, but shooting them in the head isn't?), levels are uninspiring copy-paste affairs (how many times am I going to see the same wrecked drill in a level?) with incredibly linear objective design (Base 2 is always the same spot, as is base 3, etc). Capturing the bases in Survival mode itself does nothing but progress the game to the next wave of dinosaurs, as even the vehicles spawn at the start of the match - you could have a buddy run to Base 3 for the Mech while you turn on the generator to start Wave One!  That's not to say the game is /bad/. Are there performance issues? Yes. Is the attention to detail lacking? Absolutely. Is it incredibly linear to the point of boredom after a while? You betcha. But until you really start to notice those things (about thirty minutes in, for me), the game is still fun in a mindless sort of way, especially with friends. That said though, for $15, I expect a lot more for my money than copy-pasted levels and textures, braindead AI, movement animations from the original Tribes (in terms of 'skating' over terrain), and a linear level experience.  For the $1 I paid for it, it feels like a discounted iPad app. Shame that when it's off sale, the developers are still asking for $15 for this thing. I'd like to see a lot more polish (and better netcode) before plunking down that much cash, especially when you're competing against similarly priced titles like Killing Floor, Starbound, etc, that are way better experiences overall.
3639	0	a	Terrible game. Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die.   The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns.   This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.  Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.  What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all.
3640	0	a	Even for 99 cents, this game is a waste of your money. It's funny at first but the glitches and bad gameplay take their toll on that fun. After playing this for a while I just couldn't take it anymore. Still, it was 99 cents, not the worst waste of money.  EDIT: I will have a new look at this game soon, people have told me that these bugs have been fixed and the game is a lot better now. Until then you can pretty much disregard this review.  EDIT NUMBER TWO: I played the game some more, and honestly not much has changed. My review remains the same.
3641	0	a	Stealing content from other game developers and lying to their fans about it, deleting negative comments on their Facebook page, setting up an Indiegogo campaign to steal even more money from their fans (They donated $500 to themselves in the campaign to make it look like it is successful) @  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/orion--5#/  , abusing employees (Firing them just before the release of the game and not paying them a single cent), abusing the current publicity they are getting (  http://imgur.com/s4WSxmf  ), threatening to sue people for having negative comments on their company (  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/d4rc74m?context=3  )    https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/   Also, this game is horrible in the first place. I bought this game last year and I have only played 0.1 hours for many good reasons.
3642	0	a	The devs jumped ship to release another copy of this game under the name 'Orion' to avoid the press on this game because they stole assets and fired their artists right before release so they didn't have to pay them and are now playing the victim and claiming it's a witch hunt because 'they're a small studio and wahhh AAA publishers are mean'.
3643	0	a	These developers are frauds.  As much as I hate Activision, these guys are just frauds.
3644	0	a	Do not buy or touch this game - it is run by filth. See below.  I recently read about all the evil, lying, deceitful shenanigans the company has been up to. A great summary here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   2 of many of their stunts...  1. People on forums, discussing how the company is lying about various things to get good PR - get threatened with legal action and possible jailtime (nice try).  2. Gives their game to a YouTube channel, with permission to even to give negative feedback, on assumption it would give good PR - doubles back on decision, and issues DCMA takedown request to remove the video.  I believe an accurate description of David Prassel (of Trek Industries, developer of Orion) is that he is the filthy scum found in a gutter that can't be cleaned out.
3645	0	a	The game is honestly not THAT terrible, but the developers are absolute scumbags. Don't give them your money.  For those unaware, in a nutshell, they took assets from other games (notably Call of Duty) and when they got taken off Steam because of stealing copyrighted content, they made a big fuss and told everyone big bad activision was unjustly attacking them.  And upon people discovering the claims were not Activision being evil, the developers tried to censor everything they could as the tide turned against them.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you TREK/Spiral. The Internet isn't your personal attack army.
3646	0	a	scum developers steal game assets
3647	0	a	I gave this game a chance, thinking it couldn't be as bad as people said it was; I was wrong.  Let me put it this way: there are Source mods that have higher production value than this game, and that's not saying much when you consider that those very same Source mods have funding from their own pockets and not some Kickstarter. This game might be running on Unreal, but it looks and feels like a bad Half-Life 2: Deathmatch mod.  Some could say that I can't compare this to AAA games, but I believe it's appropriate to add that I had more fulfillment out of both Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City and Aliens: Colonial Marines than I had with this.  It's worth the $1 they're charging as of this review, but no more than that.

3649	0	a	This Is way more horrible than the metascore suggests. I dont see how anyone in their right mind would play this for fun, aside from laughing at how horrible this game is for a few minutes. There is a reason this game is only up for 99 cents. The paid reviews should be investigated as well.   Buyer beware.

3651	0	a	Just played it for free, but I feel like they should have paid me to play it. It took me a while just to be able to play it. At first, I tried joining public games using the matchmaking option, but I was immediately kicked from the lobby every time. I finally got to at least try it out using the 'Play Solo' option. The game is ridiculously glitchy. The game froze for about thirty seconds, I was constantly running into invisible barriers, which I had to jump over, I tried to purchase a certain augment and it purchased some random one I didn't want, and I spontaneously lost the ability to shoot or reload, despite it saying I had full ammo. Despite the PS2 era visuals (don't let the video previews fool you) I still suffered from a horribly low framerate. Oh, and all of that happened in less than 15 minutes.  It was enough to make me think those giving this garbage positive reviews are either dummy accounts set up by the devs or they are just trolling me.
3652	0	a	What a huge piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Very poorly optimized.  Framerate is poor and drops constantly. Specially when the dinos come.  Unplayable, unenjoyeable.
3653	0	a	I've fallen victim to made up quotes shown in the trailer. Where do I start? I'll start with the most trivial things - graphics.  They are bad, like bad bad. Low res textures, game looks like late alpha/early beta. It's also poorly optimised and if you don't own a decent gaming rig (like you own an aging gaming laptop) then forget about your game looking anything close to what you can see in the trailer. Even setting everything out ot max makes you feel like all those blurs, blooms, dof effects are to cover how ugly this game actually is.  Graphics are not deciding here, let me move on with the review.  Gameplay is extremely boring and unsatysfying. Killing dinosaurs? That's cool. Well how about any progress, strategy, real objectives? All of that was replaced by run and fly tactic (also exploiting bugs and broken pathing of enemies), pretty much all the guns feel the same (like bb toys) and objectives are just to have a laugh at them every once in a while. Go the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to the objective, stay there for 15 secs, get nothing but a vehicle so you can run back to the base asap. Wow, jesus!  Enemies? All the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing same, slaying a t-rex doesn't give any satisfaction whatsoever but some slow-motion for 15 seconds straight so you can meditate on your miserable life, since you're still playing this game and wasting your time.  Audio is just crap. I think you can easily tell that by watching some gameplay video. I'm not going to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with onomathopeyas.  Btw. Watching the trailer again - haven't you noticed this actually trolling? Who would believe this is 'the most fantastic game' anyone ever played? It's not, unless it was this guy's first game. 'So cool I love it'? Now that's a cool quote. 'The metacritic score is misleading'? Of course it is, this game is 2/10 at best.  Look, getting this game for its current price is kinda a bargain. But keep in mind you only want to get this if you're: -A hipster -A game collector -A suicidal maniac candy crush veteran who's got no cash in his pocket and wants to commit suicide during playing a co-op shooting game.

3660	0	a	When this was Orion: Dino Horde, I would have recommended this game.  Most of my time spent playing this game was when it was under the previous title, and I throughly enjoyed my time with the game during that time. I randomly decided to try it once more, after its update to the new title to see if it was still okay.  The menu UI for the game, with the transition, feels like it under went a 15+ year regression compared to what it was previously. They had a fairly sleek UI previously, that overall looked decent for a modern age game, and it functioned well enough, and now the new UI looks like something that might have been taken straight out of the late 90s, maybe early 2000s.  Aside from that, the views while in the game, at least to me, went from feeling like a decent first/third shooter to feeling just cramped. I could be wrong on what I recall on this point, but I remember having a wider field of vision for both first and third person views, and even as a spectator floating around, I recall a wider view than what is shown.  On the positive side, it is still a good game for the price.. it just feels more deserving of that price now, instead of feeling like an amazing game for the price. If you need something to entertain you for a couple of hours, this will certainly do it, especially for the price on it.
3661	0	a	this game was a dollar and I still feel like it wasn't worth it  that's like an entire twix bar man
3662	0	a	This game is simply bad. Based on a weak engine (Unreal 3 - outdated, doesnt support ms antialiasing just the terrible fxaa etc.) Awful animations, boring gamemodes and maps... Dont believe to those who tell you dont believe to metascore.  If you want to try out an interesting multiplayer fps with asymmetric teams I can recommend Natural Selection 2. That is a well made game. This is not.  Oh and I mostly forgot to mention the ingame shop where you have to buy extra skins, equipment and animations for real money - but fortunately that wont be a big temptation.
3663	0	a	Every time this game gets too many bad steam reviews, the developers re-release it under a different name. I think this is like, the 3rd or 4th time?
3664	0	a	This game give you some amount of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in ur â™¥â™¥â™¥ cuz you eat large D while shootin dinos. BAd game Like 3/11teen

3669	0	a	Even though I bought for discount nowadays I feel like an idiot for still having about 4 copies in my inventory that was supposed to gift for friends to play with, but felt embarrassed of doing so because the game was so unfinished. And the other issues with the company itself won't help its popularity. Still kinda fun to play if you take in consideration that it is buggyish.
3670	0	a	It's just a bad game tbh.
3671	0	a	really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game but worth the 99c price tag
3672	0	a	With 160++ hours on this game over the course of almost 1 years seeing this game in steam. Good game with high potential, sadly the devs take this game lightly.   the game stopped developed after the 1$ promotion and later the F2P status. and lead to other kind of problems.  I tell you with my honest point of view  - no or too little guide for newcomers (in-game help) - bugs, frequent crashing problems and poorly optimized game mechanic. - time consuming steam achievements. - lags or high ping problems (if unlucky, mostly unlucky) - inactive community in forum  - repetitive and easily get bored. nothing much to explore. - unforgiving for newcomers, you need to level up to get advantages on your characters. - too much game mode with each of them have under the mediocre optimization. (too little players play the game) - servers mostly empty. rarely seeing others game mode in play. - very bad radar display - glitched map. - bad optimization on rampage mode especially for dino part.  the good things are:  + a lot of species of dino. flying one, small one compy, big one t-rex raptor, etc + has fps style mixed with survival elements againts dino. + vehicles. a lot of vehicles + 3 classes to be played. + it went F2P, so no harm if you regret playing this game.  conclusion - no harm to try this game. sorry to say, due to its state i cannot recommend this game to you until the devs perform any responsible action to fix the current issues.
3673	0	a	Absolutely terrible, do not waste any money on this whatsoever. Complete trash.
3674	0	a	Just don't buy this game.  Why? Not because of the CoD weapon copy situation that is happening. But because this game is just boring. The enemies run straight up to you and do the attack move thing, and this game doesn't add anything new that makes me enjoy this game.  I've played it once, and the next day the game just doesn't want to start up. What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...   I wish I didn't buy this game.
3675	0	a	Unfortunately shady devs.
3676	0	a	Ooo he stealin'!
3677	0	a	This game for me was more of a Yes/No thoughts about it. I usally found a match, so that was good; Gameplay gets boring after about 2.5hrs you just do the same thing over and over unless you change gamemodes which may give you another 1hr of gameplay. The weapon buying system is decent, you can buy turrets, Flamethrower, Minigun, swords, New primary weapons, Grenades, ect. Some of the reloading animations can be buggy, such as fingers going through weapon. Overall this game  just  went below average.
3678	0	a	You know its bad when they use Steam reviews in there trailers
3679	0	a	too many glitches and stuff they need to fix them
3680	0	a	Pay real cash for in-game items for a game which you already paid for?...Really?...Might as well make it free to play then.
3681	0	a	So I see a ton of reviews stating that 'This game is fun! This game is Awesome!! Best Co-oop ever!', but none of them give you any details at all. I see some that do, but it annoys me that they put up a 'release' video that has multiple reviews doing just what I hate. Don't get me wrong though, I do love the idea of showing the communities love for a game by putting their name on the video, but at the same time it's bad. I'll get to the point though, the review of the game via pro and con list.  Pros: The game is 0.99c. It has co-op in so many ways. It has pvpve. it has hordes of dinos. It is satisfying to kill a bunch of dinos with a big gun/tank. There are lots of weapons. Conquest mode has a very interesting concept. It has the old announcer styled 'Double Kill, Triple Kill, ect'.  Cons: There is a bug that allows your 'Private' server to become a public server without warning. There is no way to change the audio for the Dino's seperately from the other audio so if your game volume isn't low the T-rex will kill your ears. For all the guns, there are really only about 10 you will ever use. If one person is killing all the dinos they get all the money, and can share it, but usually won't since the good weapons cost so much. Getting a tank is a savior just as much as a death wish, as you can die in seconds to anything larger than the acid spitting dinos.(T-rex, stega, ect.) Getting stuck on spots is very likely. The tank's machine gun is ear â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ much like the large dino roars. The Mech is awesome looking but will die even faster than a jeep without a gun will. There are turrets, but they only last for 60seconds. They have an apc that does tons more damage than the tank, and has seats that are supposed to allow passangers to shoot from, but they do not, and it has a main gun that was apparently taken out so the main weapon has a non-functional cannon on it now. The most viable way of killing dinos is running them over, but that will get you far far far less credits so you will be less useful versus large dinos. There are still other bugs that have not been adressed. Controllers still do not function properly with the game. The new update has brought in even more bugs than before it seems. This is supposedly the 3rd time the game has been 'redone' or whatever they would like to call it, and the ammount of change is so pitifully small that it's not worth mentioning.  So after putting all that in, I'll say this for my final words. I have played the game quite a bit, I'm lvl20+, which I didn't put as a pro or con because I didn't think of it as especially one or the other. I have used most of the weapons except for a select few that I just have not wanted to use at all. I've played all the co-op maps so far for survival and conquest. I can say this from my experience. I would not pay 99c to play this game. It is fun for a short while, but after you get frustrated with it, and after you realize how buggy and glitchy the game is. You and your friends will quickly move onto other games, and the fact that they have renamed it(for reasons I didn't look into as I didn't really care.) along side pricing it at 99c now, makes me feel like they have possibly given up on fixing anything with it, and just want to squeeze this lemon for it's last drops of juice. They put out a fancy trailer that recognizes the positive short review from the community, and left it at that. So I say keep your dollar, and buy something else. This game will most likely rot in your steam library like it has mine. It has become that game that me and a few friends play for about 1hour every 2-3 months then forget it again because we hate the bugs and glitches.
3682	0	a	I never enjoyed this game anyways because it always seemed choppy and unfinished. Now that there's controversy about the dev stealing assets (and trying to blame Activision for stealing THEIR assets) it just adds fuel to the fire. Bad game and bad devs.
3683	0	a	Despite having a relatively good computer, I found it really hard to play this game. Many of the reviews had good things to say, though, and I wish I was able to experience all that it is capable of.  Maybe I'll try again at another date!

3687	0	a	So it got updated. And nothing from what I've noiced has changed. It's still the same boring buggy mess when it was orion: dino horde. Just go buy primal carnage instead. That's an actual good game where you shoot dinosaurs.
3688	0	a	I found out the hard way that I really don't like being savaged by raptors that have 3 frames of animation to their name while my buddy kills a T-Rex who got stuck in a rock in the background and a very enthusiastic announcer yells 'Bring me some pizza!' at the top of his lungs. No sir, I don't like it.
3689	0	a	I think the metacriti score of 36/100 is correct kinda lifeless and dumb to be honest. i had 0 health but lived ?!?!?!?!?
3690	0	a	I ventured into this game excited by the void in my heart which could be filled with dinosaurs. However I came out of this game with half my brain missing. It is very poor. Furthermore this game along with Chivalry Medieval Warfare have been getting rather jealous recently as I havn't played them for a while. They have started to attack and pillage my internet connection. As a result i have rung up BT and they are sending me a new home hub. All because this game is garbage and gets jealous of other, better games on the market. Avoid if you enjoy your sanity/internet connection.
3691	0	a	So. The Dino bit is...ok. Not that good overall. Then you open up a new ugly can of worms with actual PVP. Oh, good god is that horrible. The guns all feel the same. Bad. It's clunky and rough. accidenally alt-tabbed out and everything froze. I mean my computer on a whole. It was weird and easily fixed but still didn't bode well when the Voice button is ALT. yeah. No thanks. I'm done and good. I'll stick to my other mindless FPS games.
3692	0	a	This is such a bad game I cannot put it down. It has the crappiest programming, the weirdest glitches, the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest bugs, and the worst possible sound. With that said, it is addicting to watch giant alligaitors with painted on eyes crawl around you in circles.
3693	0	a	This game is horrendous. It's built like a free-to-play game with microtransactions, but this game has the audacity to ask for $15, but the only reason why I purchased this game is because it was 99 cents. I want my 99 cents back. This game is terrible and deserves to be taken off of Steam.
3694	0	a	So bad, that is fun....but is a very bad game XD
3695	0	a	This game is terrible. First 2 minutes sure that was fun but after that its terrible. The reviews below are misleading the trailer is nothing like the game, this is just Halo with Dinosaurs. The game is full of microtransactions and full of glitches. Do not trust the trailers or reviews that are postitive the developers are lying and this is not even worth putting on your Hard Drive even if its free. DO NOT be pulled into the heap of trash which is Orion: Dino Horde
3696	0	a	Graphics are great, but the gameplay is just tedious and boring. It is like Gears of War Horde mode but more crap thrown in. Weapon cost is extremely high, and the 'defend points' are never near any actual defensible position. If you have 4 or more people playing it can be good, but it still seems very lackluster. In my opinion not worth $1.
3697	0	a	this game is awfull at the end of every round you fix your generator and buy new guns you cant get new guns unless you fix the generator up abd you end up fight hordes of dinos with a teir 1 pistol! its garbage dont install or buy
3698	0	a	game is very laggy and graffics are bad, if you are looking for an fps that will make you poop your pants this is it though. the game has such lag that the dinos come out of no where and kill you.
3699	0	a	Don't buy this blanatant rip-off of halo 1 with dinosaurs. On top of the horrible framerate, graphics, and gamplay you are given very little direction once you start so IF you decide to buy this be sure a friend is able to hold your hand for the first few minutes.

3704	0	a	its like a worse version of primal carnage. the sound and movement aren't really sinced at least when u shoot.
3705	0	a	This game can be fun at times. Playing survival whilst flying in helicopters and blowing the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of dinosaurs is pretty fun, but this doesn't make up for the downsides.  The graphics in this game is meh, just meh. The lens flares can literally be blinding on some maps and the textures for the dinosaurs make them look like Jurassic Park CGI (the first one). For some reason, this game is EXTREMELY laggy. Even with my GTX 650 and 8 GB of ram, this game can only run around 30 frames per second. Not only this, but it looks made for the Wii.   The gameplay mechanics are much like Left for Dead 2, except worse. You survive wave after wave of dinosaurs trying to destroy your generator (sidebar, why the heck do they go for the generator?). Then you need to go 'hold points,' after which you are awarded with different vehicles (ranged from jeeps with miniguns, jeeps with no point, a tank, a mech, and yes, helicopters). These vehicles have the absolute WORST driving mechanics...you control your vehicles...with your mouse. It's SOO HARD! You're constantly crashing into things which damges your vehicles quite a lot. You also are able to purchase weapons, upgrades for your weapons, and upgrade your character, which overall is not that bad of a system. Other than lacking a good variety of weapons.   So there is one last problem with this game...the dinosaur AI. Literally the flying dinosaurs (my friends and I call them poops) are the most irritating mob in this game. They randomly divebomb you and have a possiblity of picking you up and dropping you from great hights. They for some reason put dinosaurs that we all reconize (ect triceratops) as bosses that try to kill you. But wait, aren't triceratops herbivores? APPARENTLY NOT!  Overall this is a good game if you get it on sale. It's hilarous to play with your friends and get a good laugh at for it's attempt at being good. DO NOT BUY IT FOR FULL PRICE, NOT WORTH IT.

3706	0	a	ONION: Dino Horde is da most thugged-out â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ vizzle game I've eva played. Y'all KNOW dat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, muthaâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥a! I KNOW dat it is unfinished n' buggy yo, but still, why release a game when up in fact it is literally, metaphorically, geographically, ironically, n' biologically da most thugged-out â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thang eva n' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Right back up in yo muthaâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in â™¥â™¥â™¥. Seriously, why even release it, dawg?
3707	0	a	Glitchy online play, if you can even get into a matchmaking game. You're forced to start out with a crappy pistol and the dinosaurs aren't as exciting as the trailer made them seem. Don't waste your money.
3708	0	a	Even though this review says its not recommended its really not all that bad if you are wanting to play a game about dinosaurs, if you can get past the flaws. Said flaws include average gameplay, bad dinosaur AI, terrible animations, poor sounding, poorly excecuted ingame features and the list goes on. Its like primal carnage or Dino D-day just more terrible and with crack down skin over it just with all the good elements ripped out. Overall its a bad game, but it isn't terrible as its fun at some points as its a basic shooter and can be thrilling when you are taking on the big dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Deinosuchus to name all the boss dinosaurs. For the causal gamer this is an ok pick up. For Â£1 its a steal so I would suggest picking it up when its on discount. Overall its a bad game but its not terrible.
3709	0	a	On modern standards the game feels and looks like a work in progress. It does provide for some fun with friends, and there seem to be larger updates down the line. I don't particularly regret my purchase, but this is not something I would suggest buying.
3710	0	a	I got it for 99 cents. It's bad. Just.... bad.

3712	0	a	they have made a lot of changes and whatnot over the years but i still think it was much better back when it was Dino Beatdown with just three giant conquest maps. i wish it was still like that.

3714	0	a	Terrible buggy mess of a game, and even worse developer (a whole lot worse than EA or Activision), there's not much else to say about it...
3715	0	a	This game has brought me enjoyment it is true; from its derpy triceratops to its 'laser swords' that definitely were TOTALLY original. This game has brought me joy, not from its gameplay but by the pure BS that the developers have pulled to make this game into the guano it deserves to be.   The graphics look like they should run on a potato, maybe 2 potatoes if they are small. The guns are ripped from other games and it is frustrating to see that there was a complete lack in creativity during the development of this game.   I bought the game on a whim because all I would be losing was a dollar. Is this game worth what I paid for it? Not entirely based on the fact that the servers always dropped connection or that it took several minutes to boot properly. After playing this game for the amount I did, I am not sure if it can ever 'run' properly. I laughed at the shear derpiness of the dinosaurs rather than enjoying the game itself and that is worrisome for me because now it just sits in my library. This game just taunts me now and I wonder what else I could have done with that dollar.
3716	0	a	They say the Meta score is wrong I think their right I agree with them the metascore is wrong.  It should be lower
3717	0	a	Honestly the concept of being able to play in various game modes along side your friends in this Jurassic slaughter house is a great idea. Personaly tho I found the controlls for the Dino's hard to manage and clunky. If you can get around some of the frusterating controll draw backs you could probably get a couple hours of fun out of it if you play with a buddy. ORION: Dino Horde shall remain a game full of quaint notions and maverick game modes.
3718	0	a	Better than the meta-score, but still not worth playing.
3719	0	a	its 99p for a reason. Don't expect a good result.
3720	0	a	This game is not worth it. Honestly, it will not capture your attention for long. ORION: Dino Horde is just another FPS that was quickly slapped together.
3721	0	a	Don't spend a penny on this game, the servers are terrible, the graphics leave much to be desired, the attack animations are non-existent. Did they even try? It's good for a short while, but never leads up to your hopes. Please spend your money elsewhere.
3722	0	a	Thieves plain and simple.
3723	0	a	PATCH THE SERVER GLITCHES
3724	0	a	Very good game for $1 it needs more hats and less dinos
3725	0	a	This is a very misleading game its makes you think these Awesome epic encounters and Amazing Gameplay in the trailer it says things like 'Paid $3.99 for this game and is better than some of $60 games' and things like that so then I try the 5 day Trial and what do I get A game that crashes contsantly and has tons of bugs and glitches and SO MUCH LAG and you may be saying you may just need a better computer and no I payed $800+ dollars for this computer and it is one of the fastes computers out there so no i had to lower my resolution disable most everything that i could and still tons of lag and its the same raptor over and over and when you try to actually play the game its way to hard even on the lowest difficulty and no I dont suck at the fps genre its the game the Allasaurus that spits acid its way to hard to kill so the only possitive think i can say about this game is that it has a massive potential and can be very very addictive with the proper updates and fixes to the bugs than I would highly recommend this but sadly no I have to hate this game and i try to not hate games heck I actually Enjoy the game Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 so I am an open Minded person. Please feel free to leave a comment and like this review
3726	0	a	I dont know one person who auctually likes this game, most my friends play it and they say its only ok
3727	0	a	Do not buy this game. I installed it since it's free for a limited time. The only remotely unique thing about this game is that it has dinosaurs so I was like heck yeah I can play as my favorite dinosaurs. But they're slow and clunky and if a human player jumps up on a rock, or even stands next to a rock, there's no way to reach them. The attacks have absolutely no range and seem to do nothing even if the human player should be within range. The only good thing about this game is that you can see some dinosaur models that have animations. Beyond that, it's not even worth a dollar.
3728	0	a	Let me start by saying this is by FAR the most poorly optimized game I've ever played. For the first hour or so of playing, the game would tab out every 5-10 minutes for windows to tell me that the game was a memory leak (though this did eventually stop for god knows what reason). Upon closing the game, the windows UI was glitched beyond recognition (probably due to all the window switching while in game) and I had to restart my computer to fix it.  Regarding the gameplay, Original it is not. The art assets are ripped from Halo (except for the dinosaur models/skins, which are just plain hilariously bad), the sound clips are ripped from Left 4 Dead and the gameplay is a simplified Killing Floor. There are 3 classes to choose from, but it becomes immediately apparent that Assault is the only viable one because without a jetpack you WILL die. The enemy AI is godawful, so the game compensates by throwing EVERY DINOSAUR IN EXISTENCE at you. Orion: Dino Horde is just a mess of things thrown together. To its credit though, it does have its moments of enjoyability, and I'm sure this game would be EXTREMELY fun to play while under the influence. Though I'm not sure what I was expecting when even the trailer for the game is trying to tell me 'please don't listen to the metacritic reviews'.
3729	0	a	mehh...you get what you pay for for.
3730	0	a	It isn't amazing but it isn't awful either. The game is a decent amount of fun, but Trek Industries is a trashy and shady company. I'm usually all for supporting indie devs, but Trek takes things to a whole new level. They're manipulative and money hungry. They lie, fire employees without paying them for their work, and they steal assets from other games as well. I cannot recommend buying this or any other games they may be involved with.
3731	0	a	Feeling like i was scammed i bought the game when it costed money but now it is free devs can you return my money because this is now f2p  To anyone who bought this i feel your pain
3732	0	a	I was not aware this game had stolen assets before purchasing. For 50 cents, it's a great game to mindlessly kill some time on, but after hearing about the theft, I regret supporting this developer with my purchase.  
3733	0	a	The company responsible for this game stole many asset from Activision for their new game called ORION, more precisely Black Ops 3 and Advanced warfare.   At first you might think that this is just some Big Guy is bullying a little company, but even if ACTIVISION is not a respectable company, theft is theft. Also, David Prassel of Trek Industries threatened many people on reddit to sue them if they didn't delete their thread calling out their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ behavior.  For more information on their dirty deeds.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   Anyway, this game sucked harder than my vacuum cleaner (Repetetive, filled with microtransaction, physic was ridiculous, etc etc). This game didn't need this obvious theft to get a negative review.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you anyway David, sue me all you want, I don't own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
3734	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a painfully average game and still feels like a Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, even with all the updates it received so far. There's nothing that makes it stand out from similar games and it has a long way to Killing Floor levels of greatness. However, if you think that aforementioned KF really need vehicles, dinosaurs and jetpacks, or you're really tired of zombies â€“ wait for ORION to go on a sale and grab it. Everyone else, save yourselves some time. I've made a longer version of the review, available here -  http://www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk/pc-game-reviews/review-orion-dino-horde/ 
3735	0	a	It was a free weekend, and I wanted to see if it was as bad as people were saying. Words cannot describe how abysmal this game is. Supposedly the devs went through the game and fixed all the bugs.   Supposedly.  Honestly don't waste your time, and certainly don't waste your money.
3736	0	a	I played this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game.Bad graphic
3737	0	a	Whats orion mean?!
3738	0	a	This game does more than charge you 1 buck, it sucks the life out of you, if forces you to play this buggy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and charge you for it, and for those who played this on the free week, my harddrive is offended and tried suiciding after first launch. 10/10
3739	0	a	This has got to be one of the most boring and most disjointed games I have never had the pleasure to play.  This game has recently had a name change, for the second time, because for some reason these developers change the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing name of their game whenever they release a 'big update'. This game was and still is a buggy pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ since launch and despite these 'big updates' the bugs remain. First time they changed the name, they didn't fix anything... They just added a microtransaction store. Because they changed the name it caused a lot of bugs with Steam and it brought the game back on the front page of the Steam store and it did NOT deserve it. And now they did the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but it didn't seem to break the Steam Store like last time; No, all this update added was some hats, controller support (which by the way made it so that it only shows the Xbox controller buttons in the main menu, well done guys), and some game modes. I didn't even bother to play any of the other game modes after seeing how godawful their MAIN gamemode is.  So what actually is Orion Dino Beatdown/Horde/Prelude you ask? Well, it's a horde mode game involving dinosaurs. A fairly simple concept: there are waves, there are enemies, you kill enemies, progress through the waves and so it goes on. But the presentation and gameplay are so horrible that it doesn't work right (which is probably why they added the other game modes to make up for the garbage that they have created).  Presentation: This game looks hideous, even for an Unreal Engine 3 game, and it runs terribly dispite how bad it looks. I had to lower all the settings down to get a decent framerate and the game definitely does not look good enough to justify it. And it appears that they added a disgusting cell shaded look that just seems completely out of place recently, weird black outlines on some places. Besides graphics, the animations are atrocious and the modeling on the guns look pathetic, the sound design is just bad, many of the guns feel weak as a result of having poor animations and sound quality. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing magnums should not sound like BB guns. The dinosaurs look alright, decent enough modeling and sound design... Until they attack you with their adorable little nibbling animations, making them look completely unthreatening. Yeah, this game doesn't look good at all.  But ok, graphics aren't important, gameplay is what matters in a game, right? Of course, only one problem, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! The gameplay is so bland and generic, it has nothing original about it, it only takes game mechanics from other games, and the mechanics that it takes it doesn't do as well as where they were originally taken from. I mentioned before how the guns feel weak, and they really do. Nothing has any of the OOMPH you would otherwise see in a competent FPS. This game's gunplay is almost as bad as Borderlands', and the guns themselves are completely uninteresting. There's very little variety in the enemies and it gets boring to fight the same dinosaurs REALLY FAST. So the gameplay is also a failure here.  So it looks bad, sounds bad and plays bad. Is there any point in getting this game? Absolutely not. It's not even so bad that it's funny, it's just awful, it isn't even worth the $1. If you want to play a good horde mode game, I highly suggest Killing Floor, it does everything right where Orion does wrong. I decided to write this review now because it seems like the developers are trying to squeeze out every little bit that they can from this game and it's just depressing to see. It feels like they really tried their best here but this just doesn't work. Guys, this game is not good, you have to move on, from here you have two choices: You either realise that game development isn't your thing, or you improve upon what you did here and take note of your mistakes. Either way, let go of this game and focus on stuff you really want to do, rather than just change the game's name multiple times and milk the ever living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of it.
3740	0	a	Oh boy, this game.  The game isn't horrible, at least not as horrible as metacritic says it is. But it still isn't good. Everyone else has explained what the game is like so I'll just do a pros and cons list.  Pros -  -It's 99 cents. -Can be fun with friends. -Graphics are mostly nice. They aren't bad, but the player models are kind of weird looking.  Cons - -Animations are horrible -Dinosaurs have skin made of steel. -Boring when played alone -Definitely not worth 15 dollars.  Overall, 6/10 would not recommend. May want to get it now since it's a dollar, but for 15 dollars, you'd expect more.
3741	0	a	Regret: The game  what seems like an awesome concept becomes boring after 10 minutes. Avoid like the plague.
3742	0	a	Turn away. Now.
3743	0	a	I dug a bit deeper to find out why I haven't had the will to play this game for more than three measly hours. Found DMCA claims, multiple titles with the same gameplay, money-whoring Kickstarter tactics, etc.  I wonder if Steam will still accept my refund.
3744	0	a	For the love of god avoid this game in its entirety. It's god some decent ideas but the execution is the absolute worst of perhaps any game ever made. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.

3748	0	a	Crashed starting a solo game. Turned all the details and everything down to minimum, still crashed.
3749	0	a	This game is just horrible. Metacritic has the right score. this game is so bad that they had to make a fake community apprecitation video to spread lies on how 'good' it is. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is no replayability, The dinosaurs feel so robotic and unreal. It's way to repetitive because all you do is shoot dinosaurs or shoot other people and you pretty much get the same experience ALL THE TIME. Did i mention that the boss dinosaurs are so freakin bad. they're unepic, they can get stuck in walls and get glitched so you can just fire away, they also feel unreal. The animations are pretty bad especially for the stupid sword. it just looks like you're love tapping those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s and not freakin slicing the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of those dinos. I really dont want to explain anymore of the horrid features of this HORRIBLE game because there are many. I don't know why there are so many Thumbs up it's just making the developers big headed causing them to make a stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥ video spreading their lies to the world. DON'T BUY THiS GAME.
3750	0	a	The graphics are low texture, the AI is buggy as crap and there are a bunch of features that don't work properly. It's fun with friends but you'd be better off playing killing floor for an evening.
3751	0	a	I hope you know what weapons to get; because those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that want you to defend that base LOCK YOU OUT IN ONLY ONE MINUTE. The sound seems to work intermittently but one thing is for sure; that stereotypical black guy voice is coool under fire! These dinosaurs are ninjas.  Sometimes the miniguns on the vehicles work. Sometimes they don't. Your friends will swear that they are overheating and take over but you know the spin-up animation isn't happening but now you want to kick your dog. Thank Glob you don't have a dog.  I played my first game and my friend was so happy to be done with our mission that I couldn't even get to see my stats. Frankly, I don't really care anymore.  This game is sooo close to being decent. There are too many niggling issues (it's not racist - look it up) for me to recommend it, however. I can only imagine what it was like to play at launch.  When I bought Audiosurf for 99 cents, I was ecstatic. There should be a 'Meh' button, but...
3752	0	a	Do not get this game. It has horrible graphics and very bad fps, even though tipicaly running 120fps on any other game. The consept is ok, but nothing great: you have to survive waves of dinos who come and try to kill you and your generator. get sanctum if you want a game like this but better.
3753	0	a	That game is Bad. And i doesn't mean idea, idea is pretty present. I mean the way it realized. Game is Raw, controls feels Clumsy, game is Glitchy, Models looking like axe-crafted wood ... it feels like - game was coded by feets, not by hands. It's looking like school-project created by something like 'build-your-game' tool, it doesn't even looks like Game. It's Awful, Uncomfortable, Embarrassing and Stupid. It's not just doesn't cost fixed price, it shouldn't have any price. I swear, i seen indie Games that has Much better Quality than That.
3754	0	a	Worst â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gave i ever played in my life.  The trailer looks really amazing and all, i was really hype when i noticed the new content would be F2P this week but once i started playing i was really not happy.  INSTAGIB, was my first game, your gun take more then half the screen and it take like 2 sec to charge it to shoot, and you can't hold it and shoot at your will, it shoot after the charge.  Second game was in some kind of Power Generator defense map.. no idea what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was going on... killing dinos for credits and XP, bought a Magnum which aim like potato gun...  Again, this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gamemode.. follow a random dude... walk 3 km, like 10 min walk (THE MAP IS REALLY HUGE) don't see anyone or any dinos on the way... get seperate from that guy, meet 2 enemies... one of them already had a shotgun, we get really close to each others.. i shoot at him at least 50 times (i'm not an idiot i was totally aiming at him) and like 2 bullets it him for 24 dmg which is not even close to 5% health.. he shoot me 3 times at like 50 feets and i'm dead. I respawn and there's 3-4 guys in our base with vehicules murdering everyone.  The graphics are a mix of 80's games graphics mixed with CryEngine 2. Sounds is terribad... Map is huge for no reason... more ressources to load in your RAM for absolutely no reasons. Peoples won't explain you the game and tell you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like 'I bet you play CoD', well at least CoD is a decent game, even the hitboxes are better in Black Ops then this game.  The fact i wasn't hitting anyone might be due to high ping servers but for me this game doesn't do it. I wouldn't even pay 50 cents for this.  Enough words. I don't recommend it.. if you like old school graphics game like Unreal Tournament 2004 but with some randoms â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ts CryEngine2-like and you like killing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ randomly for no reason to get own by RANDOM enemies. This might be your game..  
3755	0	a	This is becoming quite laughable. This useless and totally anonymous 'game' just keeps popping up as free trial for days. The reason? Uh... let's guess.  The positive reviews in the trailer are those written in the 'store page', paste/copy. Not even good at cheating
3756	0	a	Don't trust the minimum system specs listed. My system meets all of them and even with all settings dropped to lowest, I only get around 3 FPS, making the game completely unplayable. This comes despite marginal polygon counts and no exceptionally heavy eye candy that I could see. There is little to no optimization of code, making what should be an easy to run game utterly unusable for anything but fast computers, and the threading priorities within the client are so poorly done that I even encountered audio stuttering in the menus before the game. Audio stuttering on SFX is one thing, but this was BGM stuttering, completely ruining immersion. Needs heavy work before I'd call it a success of any sort.
3757	0	a	I only have 17 minutes played, but the 17 minutes were dull enough to make my eyes glaze over. The gameplay is boring and repetitive, the voice acting is awful, the combat is easy enough that a person with no eyes could beat the enemies, and the maps are overly large for no reason at all. I don't think there is even an end goal in this game.
3758	0	a	Graphics 4 out of 10 In-game sounds 3 out of 10 Gameplay 6 out of 10 Story N/A Multiplayer 6 out of 10 Price-quality 8 out of 10  Summary-The game is really worth 1$ but don't expect anything fancy.It's poorly optimised and has bugs.It only has multiplayer function.
3759	0	a	It's poorly optimized and doesn't look like the screenshots.
3760	0	a	its bad
3761	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a game that brings forth many interesting gameplay mechanics but so far seems to falls short in its execution. The developers definitely have many ambitious goals set for Dino Horde but seem to lack the skill and/or funding to implement them properly. The animation quality is fairly poor and the game is still extremely buggy with texture detail fading in and out constantly, frame rates dropping (even on high end graphics cards) for no apparent reason, in-game audio buging out on occasions and with hitboxes that are just seemingly broken. I would be able to forgive a good many of these short comings if the game was an Early Access title however, seeing as this is a full release and updates have yet to fix these major issues, thatâ€™s sadly not the case. Overall the gameplay just feels clunky and underdeveloped with a lack of attention to detail as well as level design leaving much to be desired. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately, in short, I just canâ€™t see myself recommending it in its current state.   Rawwr!!  4/10  Prelude update - About two days after I posted this review Orion Dino Horde was updated and changed names. I have yet to try Orion since it's update and second name change to Prelude (mainly cause I have no dersire) so I can't say much about the 'improvements', however one thing I do approve of is the new $0.99 price tag. Still... Last time I played Orion it needed a lot of improvment for me to have given it my recommendation so I'd still be warry if you're considering purchasing this title.
3762	0	a	Single Player: PVE review. For PVP look for another review.  in this, hopefully final, incarnation the game moves into the world of microtransactions. the game is still unplayable in single player (its just multiplayer mode w/o other players, no bots). best if experienced w/ friends for a laugh, the game has no fun factor asside from dying with style.   i bought the 4 pack for 4.99 and i feel ripped off. if your going to support your product w/ microtransactions you need to make it free. i know it was done to avoid login but do the microtransactions come right out of steam wallet? (honest question. i did not have the endurance to explore the store after discovering it)  basically this is the same terrible game it has always been. good for a laugh if in the dollar bin.  i am The Evil Dr. F and i DO NOT recommend this game. (unless you and your hordemates can get it for about a buck)  URGENT UPDATE 7JUN14: Game still has no realistic Single Player even though it boasts of it on catalog page. Game still requires friends and a sense of humor to play. To some extent a willingness to die with style instead of winning is recommended. It STILL has a store.   Updates have made the game more easy to look at (when crippled, or abducted by a pteranodon). Still cannot run and jump at same time (so no bunny hopping).
3763	0	a	I can't play this game! I had to put myself into it to play just 1 match, frequent crashes, losing connection from hosts, the servers list doesn't load... there are just too many bugs in this game. When I finally got to play... god... The gameplay is messed up! When you shoot a dinosaur they don't feel anything, they don't stop running. They will only when you kill them. The audio of the guns is a mess. If you shoot with an automatic rifle 40% of the shots will be silent because they are too fast... If you enjoy this game is ok! It's just 0.99 cents right now, but don't buy it if you haven't tried it yet. I had enough after 2 games, there are too many bugs and glitches.
3764	0	a	Are you looking for fun, excitement, adventure, and a one way trip to cool visuals?? Well then go and stare at a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing wall. Better yet go and try to moon a King Kobra while 3 feet from it and stare at the ceiling in a hospital because atleast you'll get a nice view as you are in agonizing pain. Seriously, this game is like what would happen if Halo and Killing Floor made love and decided they had better things to do so they chucked the thing off a cliff. But then it was adopted by the brilliant minds that brought you Ride to Hell: Retribution.
3765	0	a	This game is bad

3767	0	a	I had this phase where i would buy most anything if it was on sale under 5$ on steam, that Phase ended with Orion dino horde, a very poor game that has mediocre visuals, gunplay, and creativity, its no more than a buggy mess that only pumps out enough entertainment to distract you for a few minutes while waitng for your favorite TV show to come on, and once it does, there's no hesitation to turning it off and getting on with your life. The cummulative money system for weapons is a probably the best idea in the game, and it wasn't ever their's, Counter strike had them beat by at least 10 years, and if you like that system, you should go get Counter strike: GO which is a much better game and i highly recommend it. It doesnt hurt to give them this rating what so ever, 3/10
3768	0	a	This has got to be just about the worst, overhyped games i've ever played. It's not hard, it's just stupid and boring. I would NEVER recommend this to anybody looking for a great game to play.... Go grab yourself a valve game, or a steam sale game instead of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.
3769	0	a	Dinosaurs AI is very bad, they only walk in straight lines. Clipping issues with dinosaurs. Graphics could be so much better since this game was release in 2012. The maps are boring, plain open fields of nothingness. The gameplay is clunky and unrealistic. Weapons seem like they don't have any weight and I think bullets travel foward until they hit something. The dinosaur theme itself, not that interesting but I decided to give it a try anyways and wasn't really disapointed cuz i was expecting anything good from the start. Wouldn't even pay 0,01 for it.  (anyone who wants to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this will be talking to the hand cuz i have better thing to do than listen to lil fan boy kids.)
3770	0	a	Dinosaurs. What's not to love, right? Right?... In the case of ORION: Dino Horde, there is a lot not to love. I was excited at the concept of the game, as I love horde-type games (MVM in TF2, Escalation in Transformers, etc.) where you are forced to work as a team to defeat unbeatable odds.   In my first time booting up Orion, I had a bit of trouble finding a server as there were not many to choose from. There are a few dedicated servers, however most are player-run on their own machines. Because of this, the lag was almost unbearable to play a decent match. There was no teamwork to be had, and usually I would blame this on the team I played with, but there wasn't any incentive to work together. I trudged on, hoping it would get better after a couple of waves. I was wrong. Server after server the dinosaurs would warp around the map, and give Michael J Fox a complex because they were so jittery.   The game feels like a Halo copy, with dinosaurs thrown in. After jumping in a jeep and manning the turret, it felt oddly familiar. This only confirmed my suspicion when I saw the tank go by. Yep, same tank, different color.   It isn't absolutely terrible, but when it was on sale for $0.99 I still didn't buy it. You may have better luck.
3771	0	a	As someone who loves dinosaurs and violence this game is the saddest creation on Steam. Not worth the .99 nor the time to install a free trial.  The game has horrible matchmaking connectivity, match sizes are too small, and invites from friends don't work reliably. The lobby menus are bloated with an obvious cash grab shop and 'look at me' achievements. After finally getting into the game the environments are so empty. Sad textures on bland geometry. The objectives are agonizingly simple, go here, push button, await dinosaurs.  The AI has simple charge maneuvers with little variance. Other game modes offer different playstyles, but those are just as droll. Playing as a dinosaur should be an exciting encounter with you as a 'boss' monster, instead you get mown down in seconds by standard weaponry and vehicles. The bigger dinosaurs available are sluggish and their hit detection leaves you wondering if you're playing on the same map. How did the developers attempt to balance smaller dinosaurs against their totally-not-spartan soldiers? They've strapped 'dino-mite' (oh god this is probably what they called it) onto the back of Compy and Pterodactyls. Orion: Dino Horde is supposed to be a dinosaur game, or at least about dinosaurs, but there are only two decent selections in the multiplayer. It is more rewarding to be a faceless marine than the game's namesake. I would call that a failure. Speaking of 'original' protagonists. Models, animations, and even the physics feel so similar to Halo titles it is like the budget was spent paying Bungie's royalties, as if they could afford them. The guns are such obvious plagiarisms they appear to have been stripped from Halo 2 and altered in the simplest ways. Round a barrel here, recolor there, different gun! The worst example is the tank. It is the Scorpion from Halo shamelessly reused. Orion: Dino Horde is a decent concept, horribly executed. The developer must be trying some last ditch effort to squeeze money out of the dying player-base. I've found out there is another game in the works, an open world dino warfare game. I can only hope that they've learned from their mistakes and attempt to make something different from Dino Horde.   Despite all that I've said I did play this game, I did laugh at it with friends, but I still feel shorted. I spent .99 on this game and I wish I could have it back. It is that bad.  TL:DR = One of the worst things you could play.
3772	0	a	Same game, different name. Would not recommend if you're looking for something different from ORION.
3773	0	a	This game just sucks, its the kind of game that a 10 yo would play, if he didnt have any other thing to play with.
3774	0	a	One of the worst games I have played
3775	0	a	A game I bought because it was at such a low price, (Like a pound or something) I knew I couldn't of been getting anything great, but I excpected to get some enjoyment out of it.  Where to start?  First off, the entire game is a horde mode, so the game is essentially a side feature of most games trying to be a full game.  The controls are okay, I can figure out how to move and use weapons.  The graphics quality is alright, it's nothing at all special.  The dinosaur models/textures are kind of out-of-place looking, they look a bit cartoony.  Whenever you headshot a raptor, it's head explodes, and it looks awful.  The game's lighting is overall very bland and reminds me of when my ENB for Fallout: New Vegas broke.  I went down, it told me 'Fight to survive', there were no dinosaurs around me, so I died.  Gunplay is fairly weak.  The weapons don't feel real, they still sound like a gentleman coughing on an operahouse.  Voice acting is okay I guess.  A wide variety of three classes, wow, so many classes to choose from, so hard to decide.  Overall this doesn't live up to the reviews shown in the trailer at all, but then again, did you really excpect that?  So what are terms for buying it on?  If you're really really into dinosaur games, this might be for you, if you're not, well then why are you even here?  Overall, boring game, nothing to keep me in it.
3776	0	a	Same game, different name. Would not recommend if you're looking for something different from ORION.
3777	0	a	suck.
3778	0	a	It trys so hard to be a good game but fails so bad
3779	0	a	This game would be good if it didn't suck so much.
3780	0	a	I tried the game serveral hours since it was free to play this week.  I really wanted this game to be good since i'm always on the lookout for good coop games, but this game isn't it.  Don't get me wrong i definitely had some fun moments when everything was working, some nice games but after a short while i had the feeling that i have seen everything there is to see.  Enough fun for 99 cents, but still buggy, especially the server browser. I couldn't sort the servers by ping because it didn't how any ping for the first 2 hours i tested it. So it was gambling if i would find a server with acceptable ping.  I couldn't join any game if i tried joining a password protected game until i completely restarted the game.  There were some crashes, sending me directly back to the desktop, really annoing if we had a survival nearly finished and no idea how to find the server that i was playing on.  In game it felt a little odd sometimes, the weapon handling seemed a little off and the physique of the dinos made for some hilarious sights from time to time. Also the penalty for dieing in the survival mode seems a little harsh. If you die you not only loos all your items, they can be picked up where you died, you loose all your perks and improvements. This penalises dieing in medium or higher difficulties so hard that you might not be able to win the later waves after getting eaten in one round. The only way you can influence the fight after a late death is driving vehicles. I know avoiding death is possible and the meaning of this game mode but somtimes there will be a T-Rex just eating you anyway.  I can imagine this game being fun for a short while, if you have friends to play it with even if it crashes from time to time. But playing with randoms in the matchmaking system and then loosing the connection/game crashing mid game can be really dissapointing.  Well if i hadn't had those crashes and a really hard time with the server browser i would have recommended this game. Even if it feels a little off from time to time you can still have some nice coop fun with it. Well they advertised in the trailer that they improved everything and made this a great game, after watching Totalbiscuits review of the first relaunch i can see that they actually improved the interface and animations a lot but the new advertising seems to promise too much.     
3781	0	a	I could recommend it, if something was done about the dinosaurs. Seriously, I'm higly doubting they did any modelling. It looks like a gif placed on your screen and they run very... weird? I can't explain, try if you want it, they did a good job on all the rest! I just can't get over the fact how crappy and ugly those dinosaurs are.
3782	0	a	I had a nice day today. I had a above average day at school today, and I came home to see that there was a free game on steam. Me and my buddy were very excited to see that the game was about dinosaurs, as there are very few of those today. So my friend and I said, 'why not?', and dove in.  After an hour of downloading, our hearts were racing. Thoughts of running wild as a gigantic dinosaur, eating anything in our path, running the jungle so to speak. We click 'play', and off we are into the world of ORION: Dino Horde.  Never in my life have I wanted to kill myself. I am one of the most postive people I know, and this game made me the most depressed, dark, and angry person on the planet. My blood was boiling at the sight of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dinosaur animations, and terrible gameplay. I am writing this with my neck in a noose, and plan on hanging myself after I post this review.   God speed.
3783	0	a	This game is just... really bad. Not polished, poor shooting mechanics, poor survival wave mechanics (we never really knew why things were spawning in between waves), and a mess of other problems. In dino survival, when a player spawns they have to run for about twenty seconds to a point where they can buy a gun. Why is it designed this way? The player spawns next to the ability upgrade teriminals, why aren't the gun terminals next to that?  The animations are so janky. The most common example is when a player is 'downed'. The player gets on their hands and knees and sort of hip fires their pistol at dinosaurs, but stands up on both knees to reload, dropping back down to their toddler crawl to fire some more. Aerial enemies move in little 'increments' when on flight paths in this sort of jerky manner.  Why does my health not regen when I'm in a vehicle? Why does the AI sometimes get hung up on players on rocks, and other times, they just vault right up? Why isn't there a prompt for raising an ally from the ground?  It all just seems really basic and unpolished. I'm not really enamored with dinosaurs so I have to go by gameplay merits alone, and there just aren't any. A lot of other games do similar ideas better in a more cohesive manner. The scary part is I've never played this game when it was 'Dino Beatdown' or whatever, and it's apparently improved a ton since then.  Skip this one. Play one of the other various games in this genre instead.
3784	0	a	Not necessarily bad, just not really amazing. It seemed like after you've played one wave you've played them all.
3785	0	a	This is not done well. The animations suck, the dinosaur movements are bad, and the guns don't kick enough. There is no tutorial, so you're thrown in with no idea how to play. I like the concept of a survival game based on dinosaurs, but this is not what I want. Besides, fighting dinosaurs as a Halo reject isn't cool. Couldn't we get something like Jurassic Park stlye characters?
3786	0	a	Wow this is bad. I didn't plan on even testing this out until I read some reviews and decided to try it for the weekend trial. Wow what a mistake. I played a whole 30 minutes of this and knew this was garbage. This game has numerous basic gameplay issues. Just to start off, you can't properly remap your keys and the keys displayed in the control settings don't correctly state what key something is currently bound to... Shooting a gun has some sort of a lag from when you actually click and the gun shoots to when you see your weapons recoil/flash... Everything is scaled horribly, it's like they had no regard for what things should look like. You'll have dinosaurs ranging from mouse size to giant size, vehicles, buildings and consoles all look like they took a whole 5 minutes slapping something together... I honestly knew what I was getting into when I looked at this game and other reviewers made me think otherwise. I am honestly more dissapointed at the Steam community for all the 'recommendeds' for this pile of dinosaur crap. Don't waste your time on this, even for a $1 there are much more polished games out there.   Metacritic got this one right. Heed my warning, stay away.
3787	0	a	this game is a waste of time dont even bother to be honest there are better free to plays
3788	0	a	The developer was banned from the Steam forums if that tells you anything.
3789	0	a	This game is great......for a good laugh. Though the laugh is not really worth $1.
3790	0	a	Trash.
3791	0	a	The excitement of this game is about on par with Minesweeper.
3792	0	a	Played this game in a FREE weekend EVENT (THAT'S WHY my GAMEPLAY TIME IS SET to 0 Hours) The sale price is a trap !! Don't buy it unless it is less than 0.49$  The game is one of those that u play for like 2 hours then never coming back to the game again Primal carnage is way better than this game  What king of openworld gameplay that can take only up to 5 players ???????
3793	0	a	Toxic Community:  I thought hey, it's only $.99 so I'll check it out. The gameplay is great, graphics are okay. But it's the people you play with that make the game what it is. Within my first five games. I was consistently told to gtfo. If you're wondering why the recent reviews are 'mixed.' Then you might be part of the problem. Not the experience I was expecting out of a dollar purchase.
3794	0	a	The metacritic score is misleading? Really developers? REALLY? How hard are you trying to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t yourselves now? This game is an unfinished pile of horse â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If anything the metacritic score is spot on. The servers don't work, the solo game is impossible to play, and the game does little to nothing to tell you how to play. The key mappings aren't the best and in all honesty the game itself just isnt finished. You put too much time into how pretty the game looks and not enough time into the gameplay. And I just love how all those 'Quotes' in the trailer give credit to no one. Who are they from? The developers. The funniset thing is I played this for free! Not only did they sell it at 93% off but I still have 4 days left to try out this utter garbage! This game is awful and I cannot recommend it.
3795	0	a	This is an abomination of a video game worse than the holocaust wouldnt download it again if it became permently free.
3796	0	a	It is rare I'm able to say this, but this is even overpriced at $1..

3798	0	a	I can play horde-based gamemodes for hours upon hours without even getting slightly bored. I've played tons of Black Ops Zombies and Gears of War's Horde Modes back on Xbox 360, and the concept generally kept me entertained and immersed in the game longer than I would have without those Horde Modes.  However, when a Horde Mode isn't all that good in a tripple-A title, there's usually plenty of other content that will keep you busy, like the multiplayer and the co-op campaign and what not; the Horde Mode is simply an addition. Lately developers tend to create more stand-alone Horde games with little to no other content meaning that the value determines how good or how bad the game is. Take Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army for example. It's a great horde experience with lots of fun to be had in the co-op. This is stand-alone horde gone good.  ORION: Dino Horde  is stand-alone horde gone haywire-bad.  The Good: Â· Reasonably large maps with objectives and hordes of dinosaurs. Â· Dinosaurs. Ross approves.  The Bad: (Oh God, where do I start...) Â· Terrible hit reactions from the dinosaurs. You just have to spray and pray that you see some blood squirting from their fugly bodies. Oh, and there are no bullet holes where you hit them, so good luck figuring out IF you've even hit them and which ones you hit and which you didn't. Â· Unorganised and messy, from map layout and design to gameplay. Dinosaurs look like they're moonwalking on an escalator, the maps are unnecessarily large, 'upgrade stations' to buy vehicles, upgrades and weapons are scattered unlogically far from each other and so on. Â· The menu looks okay, but everything else is just so damn aweful: the HUD and chat-window are just large bulky windows that take in unnecessarily huge chunks of your screen. Â· A few 'game modes' that make little to no sense what so ever.  The Ugly: Â· The visuals look just acceptable on screenshot, but ingame it's simply terrible. It feels like a rushed and forgotten product the entire time and it's broken at its very core.  Final Verdict: Save your money (even the 99c for which its being sold lately) and do not waste your time on this mess of a horde-game. Boring, ugly, broken and generally dumb,  ORION: Dino Horde  underdelivers in every sense of the word. You may get a laugh at the terrible overall design of the game when it's on a free weekend and you're drunk as sh*t and high as f*ck munching away a pizza on a overly hot summer evening with some equally bored friends.  1.5/10, and that point and a half is simply for the dinosaurs. Rawr.
3799	0	a	Probably the worst game I have ever had the displeasure of playing, seriously not even worth 0.99 cents.
3800	0	a	Everything about this game is terrible, down to the real money customization store. If there has really been so much improvement since Dino Beatdown, I don't want to think about how awful THAT was. But really, renaming the game was just a cheap ploy to escape the awful reviews it had deserved upon its original release.  A generous 2/10
3801	0	a	Fans of Jurassic Park and Gamers alike have been waiting for years to find a halfway decent Dinosaur video game! To see all of their favorite dinosaurs from when they were children to come to life in a dynamic world with beautiful visuals and emmersive gameplay! Now, after all this time...  THEY'RE! STILL! WAITING!  Instead, play a terrible game with badly rendered character models, horrible animations and ridiculously flawed, generic combat!   Witness a game experience like no other! The development crew spent Days! Hours! Minutes! Seconds making this game! Making sure it was absolutly perf- *laughter* Sorry, oh man, I couldn't do that one with a straight face. But seriously, F**k this game. xD   Experience all of the gamemodes that you've played a million times in every other first person shooter on the planet, but this time, with maybe 6 dinosaurs that you could kill with one shot!   You're going to buy this because you can play dinosaurs? WELL WE'VE GOT ONE GAMEMODE FOR YOU.     Thats it. One Gamemode.    Starring:  Discount Multiplayer Announcer voice from Halo.  Awkward Running.  Lag.  More lag!  Bugs!  Clipping through walls!  Clipping through other walls!  Mediocre soundtracks!  Square rocks.  Invisivble bullets!  Invisible bullets!  INVISIBLE GOSH-DANG BULLETS.           Dayum, and we thought Hunter Blade was bad!
3802	0	a	This game is the worst catastrophe since Chernobyl.

3804	0	a	Why is this game getting good reviews?
3805	0	a	Terrible game. Mosters attacking you in between waves, no time to do anything in between waves, not even close to a smooth game.  1/10 would definately ask for my Â£1 refund
3806	0	a	When I first contemplated buying this game, I though: It's so cheap. It's like buying a can of coke, surely this will be more enjoyable. I was wrong, this buggy, spasmy game full of rubberbanding is not only more repetetive than a pendulum, but is actually less fun than watching one. The graphics suck, the game lacks animations, the sound is lofi. Even the announcer is laughably terrible.   There you have it. I should have gone with that can of coke.  3/10  Also, can you get refunds on steam?
3807	0	a	&gt;DO NOT BUY &lt; even when it hits 0,99 DONT BUY STEAM SHOULD HAVE A DEL BUTTON FOR THIS ONE

3811	0	a	This game is pretty repetive. I can not see anyone enjoying this unless they are playing with friends. And only enjoy it for a day at the most.
3812	0	a	Okay, simply put...I hate this game. Horrible framerate. Bad controls. Annoying music.  Good thing I only bought this game from someone for 20 trading cards. I wouldn't have paid $15 for it.   I would rather play TF2 or Section 8 instead of this game.
3813	0	a	it sucs
3814	0	a	This is the worst game since I played Apocalyptica back in 2003. I don't understand how it is worth more than 10 cents. It should be free, or the developers should pay me money to compensate for my suffering.
3815	0	a	God awful game. Visuals are worse than the original Halo CE. No working servers. No instructions or comprehendible tutorial. The shooting feels like a trackball arcade shooter with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ stuck in buttons.  Do not buy this game. It's not even worth 99 cents.
3816	0	a	Warning , there is NO invert options on this, i have waisted cash and space on this . if you do find options for this pls let me know as i cant find invert anywhere. good looking game but built in the stone age it seems:( 
3817	0	a	From a 100% honest reviewer:  Hi guys, this game wasn't too bad! The graphics were definately a bit underwhelming, especially the way the dinosaurs moved. However the gameplay was fun and easy to learn. I picked up pretty quickly and was able to play some fun rounds. However, it was slightly repetitve, and for me, it didn't really have any replay value. I wouldn't really play this game a lot.
3818	0	a	First match I get the flag and a T-Rex tries to eat me. I glitch through the bottom of the map and am stuck down there for the rest of the match along with the egg. Very buggy.
3819	0	a	This game Ä°s not fun it looks fun but its not you just cant do anything fun. The dinos are pretty crappy and the classes are not interesting. I would have never bought this game if it wasnt on a steam sale.
3820	0	a	lags whit intel celeron 6/10
3821	0	a	It;s and alright game, however I wouldn't recomend wasting your moeny on it, it's not a game that is worth moeny, also it crashes whenever you move on to a new map after finishing a mission.

3823	0	a	Cool concept, Poorly executed.
3824	0	a	it dose't woke on my windows 7   WTF I wrote this review when i was seven. My friend got me this game to play it but it is not working. I am gonna try to fix it bye reinstaling it but I cant stop laughing about the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ review I left/
3825	0	a	This game is still crap.
3826	0	a	I dont even know where to start, the game in short is a terrible mess. Ugly and confusing GUI and the game's graphics even on best resolution leave much to be desired. It amazed me because the screen shots look good, even fun, but like every movie trailer these pics were probably the best parts of what this uneventful game has to offer. Trust me whan I say this.... STAY AWAY you'll thank me later.  Update: The game has gotten better since writing my review, but it still is graphically inferior. If you see my review just skip this game and try the devs new game The orion project. This game has much more promise, its currently in early alpha stage but well worth the dollar.
3827	0	a	Taking a bloody â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ would be funner than thhis game
3828	0	a	This game is the love child of nazi-zombies and borderlands, except this child has an extra chromosome.
3829	0	a	Play this if you hate yourself... and dinosaurs!
3830	0	a	99c? Not worth it. Atleast I saved 14$ with the sale. After it I bought 14 packs of sour skittles with the other 14$ I burnt my mouth. That experience was better than this game. The game -1/10 the skittles 11/10.
3831	0	a	This game is awful. Now I know what you're gonna say, 'How is it bad if you played it for less than an hour?' That's true, but it is extremely laggy, god-awful with a controller, and graphics are terrible.

3836	0	a	Do not ever ever ever buy this... the fact it is in the flash sale proves the incompetency of steam in gettting rid of decietful, horrible games.... next game is going to claim to cure cancer
3837	0	a	Here is what we have learned from this game: Dinosaurs and Killing Floor do not mix. At all. They just don't. The people who think this game is good are lying to themselves. If you check the public multiplayer servers, there are many. Many barren, unused servers. It took one try for my friends to find the game that I had joined through the server list. That is not what I want in the game. Neither is a dinosaur Killing Floor knockoff. I guess that's what I asked for when I bought this game for a dollar. Yeah, don't buy it. Save your dollar.
3838	0	a	The worst game I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Not even worth the $1 its on sale for.
3839	0	a	Well, it sucks.

3845	0	a	its a rubish game isnt it 
3846	0	a	This game is funny for about 10 minutes and then you realize that it's awful and don't ever play it again. It's like trying to watch a movie that you think is funny-bad and just realize that it's bad-bad.
3847	0	a	Basic Review: Interesting, but is a short lived game Purchase: I guess so...if you've really got nothing else to do. As this is a neutral review, I can not give this a thumb up.  This game imploys creative new approaches to the basic defense game. Dinosaurs attack your facilities and your team. You goal is to survive each way while upgrading to stay on top of it all.  This game is very fun, if you play it in small volumes. It can get old very fast though, it's very repetitive.
3848	0	a	Edit: Auguest 29 2014  This is the second time this game has changed names after giving itself an update. Kinda fradulent since when does having an update give you the ability to change the name of your game from the original version, to Orion: Dino Horde, and now to Orion: Preulde? Short story sweet, the game is fun for the first day but then gets really boring. Not worth $1 imo. If you want to know more, you can read the rest of my review below or look up TotalBiscuit on youtube for gameplay and developement of this game.  Date: March 12 2013 Lots of reviews of this game says 'This game isn't as bad as the metacritic score says it is' or 'This game has improved a lot since the original.' Sorry to say, but if this game improved a lot, it wasn't much of a game to begin with. There's no tutorial at all so you're forced to jump into one of th five or so game modes all of which pales in comparison to survival. There's versus and capture the flag, but it's no Left 4 Dead--that is, the balance is totally off. All the dinosaurs suck except for the T-rex who can toss instadowning rocks (OP) and who can instakill any person close enough to them by swallowing them whole (Super OP). There's other dinosaurs who all boil down to Dinosaurs who all suck and the T-rex. There's tiny dinos who die in like 3 seconds of getting shot or the big ones who can survive getting shot, but who have problems getting kited all day. The marines don't have much variation in viable choices either. There's the assault, the support, the scout, and the assassin--all of whom gets their asses ran over by the hordes of dinosaurs except for the assault who has a jetpack that lets him sits in the mountains on the edge of the map and allows him to pick off the dinosaurs one-by-one while being untouchable to them.  Sure this game (or any game) is a steal at $1 but after about 2 hours of playing I had enough as I got bored of sitting up in a mountain peak and shooting down at the dinosaurs, running around to random checkpoints for unexplained goals throughout the map for up to at least 5 minutes, and playing games where people were only OP T-rexes or OP Assaults. The most fun I had in this game was driving around in a car and running over dinos while I was spamming #Orion:Driving Hit &amp; Run Simulator but that and the game gets old very fast as you soon realize every map is just an excuse to get to random waypoints for no reason which just slow down gameplay just to shoot more dinosaurs.
3849	0	a	I think this could have been a real hit had they just made a few simple changes to the gameplay, but as it stands it's a miserable game that really just doesn't make any sense. The problem is that the plot is just ridiculous and itâ€™s badly executed too. I have to confess that when I played the game it was riddled with bugs, so it may have improved by the time you read this, but I am afraid I just can't recommend it at all.
3850	0	a	SERIOUSLY? YOU SAY THE BEST GAME EVER? THIS IS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BULL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥    if you want a REAL GAME of dino buy primal carnage but i don't name that a 'video game' this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
3851	0	a	First of all....this is a bad game! Don't get fooled like I did. I thought: well it can't be THAT bad,but it is. To be fair, I bought it for 99 cents so I guess it's a good deal,but it's not worth like 5 $ or something.
3852	0	a	no seriously. no one should ever buy this game. not even for â‚¬0.99
3853	0	a	I mean its kinda fun, but its just terribly made. Really badly done, choppy animations. The textures are muddy and bland, but some of the bigger dinos look good. You fight wave after wave the same way in the same area so it gets repetetive very fast. The weapons all handle like old school doom guns, along with the iffy hitboxes it just makes for a boring experience. After playing Primal Carnage(buy it), this game just doesnt have any appeal to me. I really couldnt recommend it, even for $1.
3854	0	a	I was able to buy 1 game and my ma said she pay for the game... so I decided to buy a cheap ugly game... ITS THIS GAME!  The Framerate issues make it impossible to play,every one who plays it is a jerk,the weapons are terrible and take all day to kill a raptor, A RAPTOR!!!  All the 'LEVEL UP QUICK!' Levels too, DONT HELP! When I saw this game I was at first like,'Ohmagawd Dinosaur game' *sees price* 'oh its a bad game :( '  This My fellow gamers on steam is what we call... 'A waste of money' I-I-I just want my money back... Or My soul.
3855	0	a	its very expensive i dont think you should waste your money on this.
3856	0	a	Too expansive for 0,49 cents. Horrible, and isn't shiny. :&lt;
3857	0	a	Played for 10 minutes...  NOPE
3858	0	a	I started this game being very excited: ''Powered on Unreal Engine''- Wow, this game looks cool! Nope, this game just suck. The gamplay is very rusty, graphics are ugly and there are just a few of servers.  5/10 dinosaurs
3859	0	a	I 'played' this game for twenty minutes before I had enough.  Five minutes were spent in a solo game to test out graphics settings. Noticed the AI was pretty terrible, but I figured it was just easy because It was only the second wave. Anyways I didn't want to make any judgements about it until I tried out the multiplayer.   So I navigated through the buggy menu for fifteen minutes. I tried to join multiple different servers. I restarted the game several times trying to get it to work, and I could not join a single game. It's really frustrating to have to give a game a negative review because I legitimately could not access the multiplayer (Which is the only draw to the game in this case) Rather than on the merits of the gameplay itself.   I could have probably had a better time smoking cat hair out of the dollar I spent on the game.  Still better than Infestation Survivor stories.
3860	0	a	Multiplayer is absolutely broken and unusable
3861	0	a	HOLY CRAP! This game is amazing. There are no words to describe the fact 1$ and so amazing. And, it's on Unreal engine... so that results in stability.  I unfortunately at this moment, cannot recommend this due to the fact it currently doesn't have linux support. I'll be able to change this when it does.
3862	0	a	With so many back of the box mechanics, how on earth could I possibly not recommend this game? Dinosaurs! Jetpacks! Mechs! Character progression! What more could you want?  Well, as it turns out, quite a bit.  From my mere hour impression of the game (and it might come alive later, I wouldn't know) the game feels like an absolute mess. Sure, they've crammed a ton of stuff into here. But I couldn't make out a *game* anywhere. It's hard to explain, but I just couldn't get a sense of what I was supposed to do, let alone why. I couldn't get any traction in this game, I coulnd't make any sense of it. Shooting, movement, everything feels loose and just *meh*. so there weren't any moments that felt satisfying.  I can't even try to comment on visuals, ripped off mechanics, or anything like that. I was just too frickin bored to even bother with anything beyond these meager first impressions.   If you can get it on sale, you're sure to get your money's worth. But if you buying games to actually play them and not just for the sake of buying them, at least wait for another free weekend so you can try before you buy.
3863	0	a	It stills being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
3864	0	a	after this 'XP GRIND' came out the game is ruined i would have recommened it but now theres ppl with such high levels who dont even know how to play the game running around and its pure chaos.. other then playing with other ppl this game is great. UPDATE still havent taken notice of XP GRIND and ppl think its just a cheap crappy game and cheating wont matter.. how would you like it if everyone on GTA v was max level with everything after all the work you put into it all now for nothing?! it sucks and all i want is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gone and at lest the leader boards and levels cleaned up but of corse the devs carely dont care enough to do anything
3865	0	a	boring
3866	0	a	it is nothing like Jurassic Park
3867	0	a	The game itself is a great game that can pass time and bring some fun, I am not talking about something that you would invest time into but a sort of game like a Zombie Mode on Black Ops, It's just a good game that can satisfy your needs for killing some dinosaurs in a huge arena that also has Objectives as well as Cars and planes to help you go around, but really other than a game you are only going to really play for around 30 minutes and never touch it again this game apparently is fraudulent or something along those lines from what I hear which is obviously not a very good thing for anyone, God just thinking about this makes me triggered about insurance fraud and crap from faked whiplash, but we are here to talk about the game.   -Pros  A good timewaster Cheap as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ - I mean at around 1 dollar why wouldn't you try it out, (don't try it out)  -Cons The game is not buggy but it is far from fully optimised FRAUD Only going to play it once a year No radar system to tell you where all the dino are so you get buttraped  Graphics are pretty bad  Did I say FRAUD already? 
3868	0	a	this game was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i had more fun wiping my â™¥â™¥â™¥
3869	0	a	Such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, wouldn't even buy it whilst it's 1 dollar
3870	0	a	This game was 99 cents and I bought it for the laughs with a group of friends and we had laughs and never played it again.  It's got an unpolished UI with icons that look like they were made in paint. Gameplay just handles terribly (as do all the vehicles) and while it looks graphically fantastic it really isn't anything more than that.  The gameplay is boring and repetitive and you need to be playing in a squad to go anywhere.  I don't know why people are recommending this game (but as with most steam reviews, 90% are just bull and have no purpose to help you). But this game, it is honestly not even worth the time to check it out.   Don't waste your money on this even if it is 99 cents again, buy some other random indie game or some trading cards because at least you'll look at them more than you will ever play this game.  Gameplay: 3/10 Graphics: 7.5/10 Sound: 3.5/10 Overall: 4.6/10
3871	0	a	Little Changed since I paid that 14.99 $ back in the day for Orion, graphically is Okay, but how the Dino's walk and attack, it's just NOT OKAY, why couldn't they take ideas from Turok with the Dinosaurs, the last Turok game that came out, was awesome as far as Dinosaurs are concerned. In this game here, since it came out, there are new maps and skins here and there for characters and Dinos, but nothing was improved either graphicaly or even gameplay wise, I would recommand this on steam sale for under 5 $, but not at a full price.
3872	0	a	Eh you have to have a really good powerful PC to play this game and this game is terrible.
3873	0	a	DO not play this game. It's not worth the bandwidth to download. Uninventive, ugly as hell, stiff, 99cents would still be a rip off
3874	0	a	Here's all the 'strategy' in this game, fill a dino with bullets, buy a bigger gun, fill a dino with bigger bullets rinse and repeat.
3875	0	a	Bought it for 93% off, one dollar, and was still disappointed.  At least the sound track is good. That's really the only compliment.  PS: They have a cash shop where they sell taunts and other stuff that is majorly unrefined, and is a blatant attempt at your money.
3876	0	a	Just NO... I got so disappointed with this game.. Don't buy it..
3877	0	a	This game sucks, I paid $0.99 for this game on sale and I don't even think I got my moneys worth. My total play time isnt even a whole hour and half of that was firguring out how to play with friends. There is no strategy in the combat because all the dinoaurs out run you. Never buy this...
3878	0	a	Definetly not worth the money, even though I bought it during the $0.99 sale. Terrible game, early 2000's graphics, terrible animations, and unbelieveable amount of glitches. 0 stars and extremely not recommended to be bought, not fun at all.
3879	0	a	This game is broken beyond all hell and sucks DinoDickâ„¢  tl;dr When a game has a 36/100 metascore, DON'T BUY IT
3880	0	a	Not bad at All, game looks like playing Unreal Tournament Evasion with more features, dinos, and vehicles.   Good: +Dinosaurs +a lot of Perks  Bad: +UI need more improvements and more easy to look +No Tutorials  it's worth if you want to try or loving co-op games, i'm not recommended because the game still need change some features and gameplay. for me, thinking before buy this one
3881	0	a	I bought this game for $1 when it was on a steam for sale. It was definately worth it at the time even after all the bugs and horrible ai, I still found a way to have a decent gaming experience. But now the sale is gone and is now $15 so all I can say is do not get this game. My biggest pet peeves about this game is its massive frame drops making almost unplayable, from 40 frames down to 15 back to 30 down 20 and its not even a nice looking game at all, you could have a top tier gaming computers and you may have trouble running this game. Although if it ever drops the price point you might consider buying it since it does have some great moments but I should also warn you that this game totally copied their last game and resold you the same thing except maybe a few things changed here and there.
3882	0	a	Terrible game 0/10 needs work
3883	0	a	One of the video games of all time.
3884	0	a	This is possibly the worst game on steam, not worth 99 cents on sale and not worth your time
3885	0	a	I can not recommend this game to anyone. The graphic engine or the way they utilize it is horrible. I get framdrops down to 5fps with a GTX780 at times. The game is kinda fun the first hour or two, but after that it just blows.
3886	0	a	For a game I have played for less than an hour, ORION: Dino Horde left a lasting expression on me. Not the kind of lasting expression that leaves a pleasent taste in your mouth, like tasting Auntie Anne's fresh home-brewed strawberry lemonade, more like the the type of expression that horribly scarrs you for the rest of your life.  I bought this game for a very steep price, like, dirt dirt cheap. I could have bought gum instead of this game, if that puts in perspective. This game, unlike gum, did not leave a good taste in my mouth, and I'm pretty sure a piece of Trident layers would have lasted me longer than this game.  Upon launching, I was greeted with a nearly 780 FPS loading screen, which subsequently dropped to an FPS of about 20. I can run solitaire at a good 25 FPS, so this game had no excuse. When entering the very first game ever with one of my friends who I talked into buying this game, promising him we can shoot dinosaurs in the face until the early morning. He called me a nerd, and he was right. I was a nerd who was sucked into this game under promises of shooting dinosaurs and having fun.   My hopes were smashed, and upon dying to a lag-spiked Triceratops who appeared to be doing the thriller, I called the game 'bad.' My friend also agreed, telling me I sucked quite an exorbant amount of male genitalia for making him buy this game. Alas, he was true. I do suck.  Not as much as this game though.  
3887	0	a	game sucks. I wouldnt have bought it if it wasnt so dirt cheap.
3888	0	a	Back when this game was known as Dino Horde and cost $20 it was actually worth it however with the update to erase their metascore AGAIN they almost reverted back the wonderful interface they had from DH into the garbage beta interface that it is now, the gameplay is the same. Everything is pretty much the same except for the armors which now look even more horrible than how bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ they looked before. Its a good thing its only a dollar, because thats about how much its worth as of now.
3889	0	a	I dont know I played for a few minutes adn unless you KNOW what to do and your in multiplayer mode you'll be fine.
3890	0	a	This game is crap
3891	0	a	Do NOT waste your time and/or money on this game.  To join a server, you have to wait until the current wave is over. If you die, you can't respawn until the current wave is over. What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. You could be sitting there for over ten minutes waiting to respawn. That is basically unacceptable.  It's like it was designed by someone who has never played an online FPS.   Stick to TF2. Forget this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
3892	0	a	There is no learning curve or anything. When I started the game, I just got dropped in a menu, which let me connect to a game. I joined a game with the easy difficulty, and found myself dying very often in the 15 minutes I played. Furthermore, the game feels unnatural, and the graphics are weak for the system requirements. Furthermore, I experienced lots of lag when many dino's spawned.
3893	0	a	So Bad Game ! Fail in Graphic and Gameplay ! Problem in PING  BUG BUG BUG ..... WTF
3894	0	a	How the heck does a game get progressively worse with time? Somehow ORION: Dino Horde accomplished that. This game used to be a fun coop game in the same vein as Killing Floor, except with dinosaurs and vehicles. Now the community is dead and I can see why with the extreme lag that gets worse with every update.
3895	0	a	Wonky Animations and Low Res Menus that will make your eyes bleed.  ****/10
3896	0	a	This game is so confusing I have no idea what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was going on but there were dinosaurs. 0/10 game 10/10 dinosaur experience.

3898	0	a	10/10 would recommend
3899	0	a	I think these devs only get money on this 'cause it's like a dollar to fifty cents at times and then someone thinks 'Oh, I can make a funny video about this game'. I assure you this title is not something you should play lightly. I have played most first person shooters of my era and this is nearly the worst one out of all of them that also tries to present itself as a finished game. 3/10 I made a video and wrote a review for it.

3903	0	a	Not even worth the dollar I paid for it. The dinosaurs always charge straight in on you. You have 60 seconds to run halfwya across them map to restock and back again which is unecessarily short. Most of the time I have no idea what's going on or why.
3904	0	a	Poor quality, redundent gameplay.
3905	0	a	If I didn't get it for only 99cents I might feel some serious buyer's remorse. Definitely not worth $15.00 let alone the 99cents. Clunky controls, unpolished game-modes, cookie-cutter builds, and shoddy environments.

3911	0	a	this game lags on my god computer, with glitchy dinos bad servers and weapons that feel as unsatifying and hard to aim as possible. the game mecanics arte repetive and often break. i went int this agem thinking this look reasonably good. NO dont even try. its all well and good adding more items and features they are good and its a good idea but they need to fix the gameplay and i dont think they would be able to address thewse issued as they would probibly have to rebuild the engine. F*** no never again.   as of 25th feb 2014 (i dont think it will improve)
3912	0	a	Junk.  Laggy, boring, ugly and (as should be obvious) very few people play.  This game has been out for 2 years, gotten several updates, and is still unbalanced and glitchy.  If you paid a buck for this, you got ripped off.  If someone gave you a copy for free, slap that person for having anything to do with this and get a real game.  Edit:  You know what? I'm not even done. I'm going to rant a bit more.  I gave this game extra time, hoping something, ANYTHING would get better. My time was wasted.  Most of the guns feel the same, aka single or burst fire, and very very weak. Depending on lag, a raptor may take up to 2 - 3 pistol clips to kill, and half to a full rifle clip to kill. The poison spitters, in addition to being able to hit you almost anywhere, shooting nonstop and leaving toxic puddles everywhere, seem to have maybe 25% to 50% of a boss dinos health (aka ridiculously hard to kill, especially early game, on easy, and considering how many spawn).  The average credits per dino is about 100, and the guns/upgrades start at about 1500 (for weak pistols) up to around 5000 for the better upgrades and guns.  And when you die? You lose it ALL.  There is a lives system that's actually more like the pickup system in Borderlands, but if you get locked in a corner where your team can't reach you and you can't get a kill (which happens quite a bit), all those extra lives basically mean nothing.  And while you do get some credits for damage done to a dino, it's going to be more like 20-30 credits if you have teammates helping.  There's not very much to say about the sound, as aside from the occasional roar, there is the non-stop, annoying TAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAP of you putting dozens of rounds into a single dinosaur, over, and over and over.  Oh and hey, there's a leveling system, where you do get very very minor buffs in exchange for long hours of slow grinding. 10% damage boost for my super weak pistols? Yes please! Each class has levels of it's own with almost exactly identical skills as other classes, to give you that wonderful feeling of starting from scratch for trying different characters?? Woot!  Ok, Now I'm done.
3913	0	a	What do you get when you cross rampaging dinosaurs with jetpacks,explosions,sci-fi action and co-op gameplay? An awesome videogame idea.What do you get when you play ORION: Dino Horde? A terrible,terrible experience. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played.Not only is it badly made,poorly executed,ridiculously framed, and badly coded.It's just unplayable game  Donâ€™t bother.Save your money.If you want an engaging sci-fi cooperative experience,buy Natural Selection 2 instead !!! :)
3914	0	a	It's ORION: Dino Horde.

3919	0	a	A game of the year contender for 1492. A great pile of dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this game. I love the lag and how poorly optimized this is. I got for the price of free. My 'special' friend gave it to me. The multiplayer is just as great* i was a laggy T-Rex munching on wannabe Spartans from Halo. Of course the object of this game is to survive the world's laggiest envirments and cute Dino puppys. Overall this game is the aborted child of Jurassic Park and Halo. Its a gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8 jk i h8 this game and id rather masturb8 to german dungeon porn. A book of the year and a gr8 contender for the Grammys. In the end this game gets 0/0 would not rate again.   * Great=Bad Kids if you buy this game full price play russian roulete with a RPG. I am not liable for any injuries from activities i have suggested in this review.
3920	0	a	I know why it's 99 cents. 'MICRO TRANSACTIONS'
3921	0	a	The only thing that is cool about this game is that you get to shoot dinos otherwise it is like quake went stonage minus the fun.
3922	0	a	i wanted to throw up
3923	0	a	The budget for this game must have been $2 :(
3924	0	a	When i've played it, it was very crazy! But the problem for me was a bit laggy really because i'm using my laptop. I don't think it's recommended for the other steam users who has a poor condition on their computers because it's just a little lag problem really.
3925	0	a	Glitchy and unfinished. Elements taken out of flash games. No story and terrible voice acting. Horrible graphics. Perfect game 11/10.
3926	0	a	This game is absolute garbage, whoever wrote those quotes were either psychotic or a moron. I got this game fo 99 cents and I overpaid, if I could take this game and wipe my â™¥â™¥â™¥ with it I wouldn't. Because it is to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for even my â™¥â™¥â™¥. 0.01/10
3927	0	a	This game is as if Satan and Hitler had a baby.

3929	0	a	I honestly dont like it that much it just feels improper, the #1 thing that annoys me is the vocals, they sound like scottish people who dident put any effort into voice acting. This new update just makes the game look like for kids now, and the taunts are just .. Wow.    Still worth the price though.

3931	0	a	Fighting dinosaurs is boring, and the PvP is the worst I've ever seen. Aiming is unreliable, the game lags with 64 ping when 4 people are shooting, its terrible.  Dino D-Day is a much better game if you want to shoot dinosaurs.
3932	0	a	This game is literally not even a game. Like, what gives, dude. I played for thirty minutes and could not join a game and it would constantly crash. Then, I actually join in a 'game' and see nothing and I have to run 2500m to get to the 'playing' area. Then, there were dinosaurs and they

3934	0	a	Wouldn't recommend it but can be a fun distraction. Depending on what you like you can find some enjoyment out of it.
3935	0	a	Don't buy this, I have a god computer and I can't run this on low setting, one level it went to night and started raining, and for the first time ever, I had to turn the gamma on my computer up. FPS was around 13 and I wanter to kill myself
3936	0	a	I wouldn't call this the worst game in the world, but it is definitly not a quality title. Before playing the game for free, I saw the trailer and instantly knew that the developers were giving their own game praise. The quotes about the game being good had no references. After playing the game, I can say that my theory was right. The human vs human games were poor man versions of halo and though the human vs dino parts are sorta fun with other people, there were three things that dragged this down; lag, crashes and extremely poor level design. It could be worth getting due to it being on sale for a dollar, but if you want to survive waves of enemies with friends, I suggest playing the man vs machine mode in tf2.
3937	0	a	Wouldnt recommend, but for $1 it has some laughs
3938	0	a	im not gonna waste my time telling you how bad this game is, but its so poorly made I could not join or start a game.

3940	0	a	Hands down one of the most boring games I have ever played. I suppose if you're interested in killing waves of dinosaurs in mundane locations you may enjoy this game, but the game is awfully boring hence the dollar price tag and constant sale for .50 cents. Plus you have the fact the developer is shady and probaly about to be sued.  'Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.' - ViziTronMan

3943	0	a	Well it turns out that my review of 'Don't buy this it's junk.' wasn't helpful. So here's a more in depth one.  ----  Don't buy this! Even at 0.79p it's to expensive! The net code is rubbish. The leveling system bad. The AI terrible. The guns, well, not to bad actually. It just feels unfinished and slow even on my over the top PC.  If you want to spend time on a computer game you can find much better ones out there.

3956	0	a	This is survival of the fittest. Or the sickest. In this case. Do you like Halo? Well, you'll at least get the interface of the old Halo: Combat Evolved. Even though this game is built with Unreal Engine 3, it looks like an old PS2 game. This game has an incredibly broken AI, bad graphics and looks like it was designed within a lunch break by two drunk students.  This is not even remotely funny. Until you add friends. Then it gets slightly better. Maybe a little more than 'slightly'. Don't have any friends? Don't pick it up. Got friends? Go play something else. Seriously.  If this sounds harsh, I'm sorry, it is meant to be. If you are looking for something positive, look at the price tag and the fact,  that it's still being updated and recieves improvements well after release.
3957	0	a	This game is so terrible! How do you mess up a game with dino's and jetpacks? idk but somehow they did. save your self the cash and just play litterally any other game
3958	0	a	This game rips off so many other games, and it does it poorly, the animations are horrible and the overall quality is bad. It tries very hard to mimic games like Halo, and it even has an in-game cash shop. It's not even F2P! This is one of the worst games I have ever played, there is so little content and there is almost no depth. I recommend this game if you are mentally unstable.
3959	0	a	It's not really that good, and even though I have only played it for a few minutes, I can tell already. It's mainly the controls, they feel pretty weird and don't work well. Good thing I played it on a free week instead of paying 15 bucks for it. 3.5/10 
3960	0	a	â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†   Pure trash. That's why it went down in price to a mere .49 cents. But go ahead purchase it. Because some of you will think 'It can't be that bad is it?'.
3961	0	a	It's Left for Dead with dinosaurs. Except you're protecting a thing, and it takes too long to get to the thing from the shops.

3972	0	a	There is a reason this game is 99 cents, because it's god damn awful.  The voice acting, the gunplay, the driving, the dino AI, and the PVP. Pvp is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, thats it, the voice acting is horrid, the gun play if you can call it that is like having a stroke seizure thing while in a whirl pool shooting a gun with a broken arm. Awful. Dino AI loves to run into rocks, and they can't understand that if your on the rock that means they can't get you.  Also, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the god damn flying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful trash. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ em.

3974	0	a	Graphics are crap, but whatever it costs a buck, the community is terrible, but that's to be expected, and it kinda just plops you into a game with no tutorial, at least no tutorial that I could find, and if you have to search for the tutorial you're not doing your game right.
3975	0	a	terriable game graphics are overrated when u cant even perform baisic mechanics like capping points  also didnt have fun with it either. i would rather play dino d-day at least i had fun with that. this game is a laugh to the original people who paid 15 dollars and yet i wouldent want to even pay 1 dollar. this game HAHA BAD. 0/10 go look into something else.
3976	0	a	Is it worth 50 cents on sale? maybe Is it worth the time invested to install, boot up load and play? Not really.
3977	0	a	Onion Dorito Hard is possibly the best FPS since Super Mario 64, no joke. I mean it has snow, hats, custom colours, DINOSAURS, guns and an 'Upgrade System' so it seems it was worth the 79p on sale. Seems to have more content than CoD and is cheaper than it.

3980	0	a	  i've been waiting for this game to be in my library for a long time... and then, one day, it was free to play! i downloaded it and... i was disappointed, even though i love dinosaurs and guns... im sorry... graphics = bad, gameplay = bad... im sorry...

3985	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.
3986	0	a	First of all I had to pay for this game, then it becomes free and then I couldn't get a refund for this game. After some couple of months they want you to pay for this.  These devs like to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up alot, like they did when they released this game In the begining. It's the only thing they're good at. I used to like this game and It's cool to see that they supported It for so long when they got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on by people whom bought at the begining. But now it's just a lost cause.

3990	0	a	Atleast refund the money for the people who spent money on your game before making it free. Kind of lucky i didnt buy more than 1 copy for the game.   If you didnt buy the game, go play it. It definately isnt bad, but the fact that the devs dont care that we spent money for nothing makes me not play the game now.  EDIT:  Although it has gone back to paid, Alot of people recieved the game for free, which still isnt fair
3991	0	a	Buy porn Dont waste money on this

3993	0	a	this game is not great. but its not bad. i do not suggest this to people who have already played primal carnage. the only problem in my opinion is the concept. and the way the dinos play out. what i do love is the vast amount of species to play as and the NPC/BOTS they work well as balancing the teams

3995	0	a	It feels like I just dropped a 1â‚¬ coin on a rush sale. I open the game try out the solo and I notice how the dinossaurs movements looks like a plank with robotic legs. I still had some faith and tried joining a multiplayer game but all the servers I could find were either on the other end of the world with over 420 ping or were password protected. I mean, holly mother of dino jesus, even the T-Rex's struggle to move between wee litle dinossaurs.  Oh look, it also has hats, taunts and mutch more fun looking things, surely they are earned by skill. Nope just by money.    So remember kids, just because the trailer and pictures look fun it doesn't mean that is fun.
3996	0	a	Feels like a PS2 game, very clunky and basic.  Devellopers are thiefs and fire their employees with no pay and steal 3D models and assets from other games.  Do not buy even for 1$ and do not buy their future â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ products
3997	0	a	Welcome to the dark side of indie games! Where games have little effort placed into them and we do our very damndest to make Minecraft's money because we can't make anything else but blocks!  'OMFG!!! Peetor! u fokn wot m8?! u oly hav 10 hrs in dis musterpeese!' hold your horses! I'm doing the internet a favor by reviewing this game! I'm surprised I played this for 2 days without drinking acid. Have I played 10 hours? yes, is it enough to review a game with a fair amount of game modes to choose from? no. But, this game is being sold off as a 'Unreal Tournament/Halo/Quake/Star wa-- wait wait wait! What?! Star wars? you mean to tell me a light saber knock off is enough to count this as a Star wars game? who rated this? 12 year old's? I'm sorry but the only thing that makes Orion related to those games are: regenerating health (Halo) and vehicles (Unreal Tournament) As for Quake, I'm not even sure what sticks out as being inspired by Quake...If you're talking about the rocket launcher...Sorry kiddies, but almost every shooter has a rocket launcher, so I guess Halo. Half-life. Unreal Tournament. Dues Ex. Doom. Battle Field. Star Wars: Battle Front, etc. Are   all   Quake clones.  This is a ADS game with   zombies   Dinosaurs and classic PvP. But that does not mean that this game is anything like what I have just listed! Do not f***ing confuse good games with this buggy indie mess!     the gameplay
3998	0	a	So... The rewiew... Bought this game for 1 euro so i dident know what to expect. Now i know. This is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest game ive ever played. I dont think you can make a game any more bad. I put the graphics up to full and it still looked like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... When i got into my first game there were no other torturial than 'Use wasd to walk' And thats it... Nothing else was there and i just walked around without knowing what to do..  1/10 ....

4004	0	a	How the heck did you mess up a game about Dinosaurs and Jet Packs?! Between the horrid control scheme, barren environments, and things don't even make sense, this game is horrid. Not worth a dollar.
4005	0	a	I played the 'game' for 30 minutes. I put game in quotes because i can hardly call this a game by definition. Honestly i have no idea where to begin with this horrible excuse for a 'game', so i'll start with the interface. I was greeted with screen prompts made for a 360 gamepad. I didn't even have a gampad plugged in mind you, apparently I am supposed to use a gamepad instead of my keyboard. Even if it was a port to PC, which it isn't, why would they use 360 controls as the button prompts?   Next, i tried to join a game; 4 times, each time unsucessful. It displayed a list of servers you can join, but may of them had a ping labeled as 'lobby' tell me, what exactly is 'lobby' ping? I finally gave up trying to join a server with people in it, and decided to join an empty one just to get into the bloody game. Hindsight being 20/20 i should have just shut the game down, and unistalled. It was free however, I was naive and wated to give this 'game' a chance. How very foolish of me.  Upon entering the match, the sound was bugged. I kept hearing a repeating sound of some sort of dinosaur trying to bite my head off every 10 seconds or so, even though no enemys were to found anywhere nearby. I had no idea what the objective of the gamemode was, but it displayed an enemy generator and friendly generator health bar, as for what the hell these generators did, I couldn't honestly tell you, but somehow my team's was down to 10%. I shot a couple pterodactyls and raptors; which I could barely see because it was on some winter level, and apparently my character didnt have the ability to wipe this all consuming frost from covering his entire visor. Seriously, it was like someone took a jar of vasaline to my characters face and went 'off you go! time to kill some dinosaurs, i think!' Very shortly after, the game crashed, which was the best part of the game in my experince, BECAUSE IT WAS OVER.   Honestly, just 30 minutes of this game gave me a headache, and im pretty sure if i kept playing i would have had a brain aneurysm. Do i reccommend this game? That is a hearty and concise NO. I don't care wether or not this game is in alpha, beta, or what have you. If you are going to allow people to play it, make sure it is actually playable. 
4006	0	a	I played an entire game of this, A WHOLE 50 MINUTES. Word's cannot describe how bland and dull this game is if it was a sandwich it would be 1 slice of white bread, no butter, folded over a sliver of corned beef thats been opened and left in the fridge so it goes all dry and hard. Not enjoyable at all.
4007	0	a	The graphics are pretty good, and there are some cool weather effects. I also like the voice acting. Other than that, it's not very good. All you do is activate a generator and defend it against dinosaurs. Why are the dinosaurs attacking the generator anyway? This game is basically a lesser Borderlands/Halo with a Jurassic setting. I did have some fun playing it with my friend, but I can't see myself going back to it.

4010	0	a	This is seriously the worst game I ever played in my life. It is not a game that I didn't like, it is hard to like because of its many bugs and lack of content and balance. However, if you don't care too much about that kind of stuff, you can have tons of fun with friends. I don't recommend it though.
4011	0	a	The game had horrid performance issues despite looking terrible, the gameplay was VERY clunky and it felt like a chore just trying to take aim at something. The combat is boring, the weapons are bland, and the whole game feels like a gimmick.
4012	0	a	Trash.
4013	0	a	I don't quite understand this - If the dev is having so much difficulties making money, and looking where 'ORION' has gone, I must say that making this free was NOT a good move, on the authors or for the customers. I understand that making this free in order to lower the hate for this game and all it's glitches is a way to go, but at least give some regard to those who enjoy this, and spend their time playing it. 
4014	0	a	This would have been an awesome game in 1999, would have competed very well with Half-Life 1. But in today's gaming landscape, it is garbage.
4015	0	a	Not so good of a game, badly-optimized too. Developer stole assets from other companies, lie/threaten legal action to the community to protect themselves, and get away by removing those content when caught, excuses attached.
4016	0	a	This is seriously one of the worst games I've ever played.  Go get it on the next sale.
4017	0	a	Oh what to say...   This game was dropped unto steam as an early access before that term even existed. There was a few spare updates to the game after launch and then nothing happened. None of the promises that were made about the game on launch ever happened. A poor lackluster game from a poor lackluster dev.    But wait, there's more...    In an effort to avoid the absolutely terrible scores the game got, it was renamed and relaunched on Steam at full price. Twice. Apart from being borderline illegal, it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ move that usually only EA reserves themselves to.    But wait, there's more...    People weren't as dumb as expected. They complained about it on the game's Steam forum. Then they got banned from said forums, actively, by the dev trying to cover up that the exact same game with a new name was in fact, a new game. Which it wasn't.    But wait, there's more, apparently...    So this game got released twice under the pretention of being something new while in fact nothing has happened since a couple of weeks after launch in 2012, THREE YEARS AGO. And now there's a 'new' game up on kickstarter. Apart from the game itself being in a sorry decrepit state, the developer is one of the worst and greediest people I've ever had the bad fortune of encountering.   The game currently costs less than an icecream. Is it worth it then? Well, depends on wether or not you want to finance a person who treats people like livestock with wallets. (Buy an icecream instead.)
4018	0	a	It cost me less than the price of a Mars bar, Im pretty sure a Mars bar has more thought put in to its coding. It lags, it hangs, it crashes harder than a malasian airlines passenger jet. The Gameplay is dull and repetative, with no clear direction given on how to complete given tasks. In short, save your money, go buy a Mars Bar!

4027	0	a	Deffinitely better than beatdown, but not by much. This is one of those games you play for one to two hours and then never again. I reccomend playing for the free weekend, and by the end of that you will probably not care about the game anymore.
4028	0	a	I got this game for .48 cents and I still feel like I paid too much.
4029	0	a	This game is not up to standards. I am very dissapointed in Spiral game studios. I would like a refund, I would like 5 chocolate buscuits and some tomato juice asap. This is to feed my cupboard hobos as they are starving becasue of this game.
4030	0	a	This game seems like it can be very good, but right now it lags too much and my computer is pretty good so it shouldn't be lagging als there's no weapon flash or recoil so it just looks kind of stupid when you fire and all that happens is a gunshot sound and some blood appears when you hit your mark. This game has something going for it and I would be willing to pay a fair amount of cash for it once the lags get fixed but right now I just can't recomend it to anyone unless your willing to play a game that will probably be pretty laggy but still good overall or if you have a very good computer which may help with the lag but I don't know for sure.
4031	0	a	I got this game because I was expecting turok, what I got was a laggy blurry dino thing chase me around until I finally figured out the controls. THEN I was killed even faster than when I didn't know what I was doing, due in part by lag. I think this could be a great game, it just needs more work.
4032	0	a	Writing to just inform people of the shady background of the current developers of this game -    http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cefrz/orion_dino_beatdown_has_just_been_updated_to_the/   and   http://www.dualshockers.com/2011/03/14/update-project-director-of-orion-prelude-david-prassel-leaving-his-employees-high-and-dry/   Basically the developer (David Prassel) took the $20k received from the Kickstarter project, and promptly fired his team.  Also, the 15 minutes I played of the game was mediocre at best.
4033	0	a	Dont buy this. Even for just a doller it is not close to anything near ready to play. Just a warning to people new to steam, if a game is on sale for a ton of and it is not a store wide sale it is not doing good. The driving is made on a 16 sided shape. wich means that you cant just turn right you make wide turns that feel like the game is laging. But no its is just a crap game. The store looked like a thing a young kid made on ms paint, The textures are blurred and ugly. The gun play dosn't work because the engine cant keep up and just feels slow. DONT BUY
4034	0	a	this game was better a year ago when it was alpha and barely ran. this is now terribad and in the span of an hour it crashed on me three times, i couldnt host a multiplayer game for anybody, let alone friends, and microtransactions. id rather watch The Kardashians than play this steaming dino poo pile
4035	0	a	worst game in history
4036	0	a	The optimisation of this game is horrible. The game itself is very repeditive, some of you may disagree but I guess the $1 it is currently on sale for is the chance for you to try it yourself. Might just be another number to add to your account. I'm not telling you not to buy it but it still may tickle your fancy. It's just not my kind of game.
4037	0	a	I got this game for a dollar and i'm not sure it was worth it. The premise seems fun, but the lack of people playing it makes it pointless to play.
4038	0	a	Unfortunately I was not able to play this game; when it would get to class selection, it would lock up. I couldn't even ALT-TAB out of it, as it was holding the rest of the computer hostage.  It isn't as though I don't have a beefy machine though:  Intel Core i3 CPU with 4 processors nVidia GeForce GTX560 OC video card 8 GB of RAM (unfortunately, 32 bit Windows 7, so 3.45 GB available)  I may try this again later, but not interested right now.
4039	0	a	I'll give you 10â‚¬ if you delete the game from my library!!!
4040	0	a	Very basic shooter, I got... Well 0.3 hrs in according to the game timer. And the game client crashed. And I've seen more than enough. This is another game I suppose could be fun in a lan party or something like that... but it might be worth the 99 cents they're asking for it while it's on sale this week... If you're bored....
4041	0	a	Buy? No.  And that suggestion is after all the praise quotes from the current trailer about the game being improved and deserving a second chance.  Dino Horde is a sequel/successor to Orion: Dino Beatdown with was universally terrible. It is a first person horde shooter much like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs, a between round weapon and augment store, and vehicle mechanics from a poor man's Halo. I felt a little disgusted after shooting my first weapon, which had a tinny sound effect and no recoil. Oddly enough, the recoil does come up sometimes. The guns just have this weak and unfinished feel. Dino waves are sent to you at lightning speed and most half-decent teams can wipe them out pretty quickly as they are sent in a couple packs that's easy to spray and pray at. When you're new, you might miss the opportunity to kill enemies or at least get a hit on them so you can get some assist credit. What makes the waves system even more terrible is the pacing. While you do have a variety of enemies, with some being faster than others, fighting them still often ends up being mass killing the Raptor-types, then finishing off the stragglers of larger, bullet sponge dino's and 'godd**ned bats' trope pterodactyls. Killing Floor has a better variety and pacing of enemies, as the speed of different mobs are more noticible and require proper prioritizing and handling by your group depending on the map you're playing.  Ammo is all handled by an ammo pack at the weapon store, so better hope you killed/assisted enough dinos and be able to make it back to the stores far away in the base after the game told you to go to the other side of the map for an outpost. I can accept the texture, model and animation quality for a cheap indie title. I think the texture quality is pretty good in comparison to Killing floor, and the animation is perhaps finicky in some cases, but the dinosaurs generally look life-like. Sound assets are pretty terrible as guns sound weak, majority of the voice acting sounds ham-fisted and terrible, save for maybe the announcer and the female scout, and the same one or two tracks repeat through the entirety of the game - menus, gameplay and all. Vehicles are extra handy in later waves, but can be a pain to drive, and lead to you demise if you get stuck and a Triceratops rams the ride, making it explode. The land hovercraft kept wobbling on the ground and I had annoyances managing the tank. Regardless, the game ended up feeling shallow very quickly - the fun factor wasn't there and I didn't see any reason to stay and level up.  I think the vast majority of the player base are probably younger types who got this on sale/as a gift and may not have much else to play. I'd hate to have played this before all the 'improvements'. There are plenty of better alternatives like Warframe, Payday series, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead, Mass Effecct 3, even Call of Duty Co-ops and Transformers Cybertron co-ops.  That being said, this game seem to have carved it's own niche, as there were a decent amount of active servers to join (like 20 or more), though that could be due to the recent .99 sale. That's probably telling alot about the quality and value of the game if it is going for 93% off when it's not a big Steam seasonal sale. I think kids and teens with more time and less money are willing to deal with this game (in fact, I probably would have been ok with it in my childhood), but adults like myself and most people on my friends list only have limited time and shouldn't waste it on this when there are better alternatives.  Don't buy it.The premise of Dino Horde FPS sounds cool, but you can get a similar and more entertaining as well as solid experience from Killing Floor. Once I got my opinion of the game, I only stayed longer to get my card drops....which I probably shouldn't have because they're pretty worthless.
4042	0	a	Seriously, take the 99p you'd spend on this game during the sale and buy one of those saver menu Cheeseburgers from McDonald's. It would be more beneficial to your health than this.
4043	0	a	This sucks dino balls! Literally!! But it was only 99 cents.
4044	0	a	This game is a bit like Halo meets Turok. My problem with this game is that the trailers, like most games, don't really do it justice. The trailer looks pretty awesome but it misrepresents the movements of the dinosaurs and the players. It is much more choppy. I would recommend personalizing the controls as well. One big thing that would make this a bit better are things like, headshots [either instant kill or massive damage]. I don't know how many times I drilled into a raptor's face and it was still chewing on my gun... Very frustrating. It has potential but it is not there yet, in my opinion.
4045	0	a	While .99cents, I would not buy this game until it is functional at least. No audio normalization, no customization without actual money, survival mode is a gimmic and fighting dinosaurs with guns that feel weak and disconnected. Servers are hosted locally. Vehicles are a joke. Healing is a joke. Damage feels like nothing. Controls are sticky and numbing and there is no replayability except if you want to achievement â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   I guarantee you that your money will be wasted on this game. I would relate this to a 500 year old ghetto house. You can buy the house for cheap but everything inside is crap and falling to pieces. This game was hastily cobbled together and updates are pathetic. This game needs a complete rework, with effort actually put into designing the gamem
4046	0	a	I would like to start my review, with the utmost important point i'm trying to make here:  It's not worth your money, not even one euro ! Aah do not let yourself get fooled by their enticing videos in which the metascore is told to be a lie,  for this metascore is very much correct.   Let me now continue with disecting this horrible game, as one would do with a dead frog (very respectlessy and relentess). This is best chewed-out, overhyped (i dare say if you only glare once, on the videos provided in the store), piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you can buy with money.  The models are truly horrible, quake live has more detailed models, than this game. The dinosuars are really stiff and inanimate, they appear the be dead before you shoot them. Never in my life have i seen such pixelate artwork being used in a game, for instance the loadout screen in which you select what class you want to play, it's so pixalated i would dare to say it's resolution is 256*256 and no more. Also the matchmaking system is realy buggy to say the least, also in the 20 minutes or less that i 've tried this game i couldn't play with my friend since this game wouldn't allow us, the lobby screen is so underdeveloped it's laughable.  But hey if you want some braindead dino killing action without even taking the slightest notice of the actaul game and the playability of it, this game may be very much for you.  Probably all these things added up makes the price 1 euro and no more, money spent on a bread is better spent money. If you are thinking to buy this game you might aswell donate one euro (or whatever currency you may use) to a charity.  Please do so for the sake of humanity.  After paying for this game, i felt so much shame that i was disgusting and thus as a result of it i automatically was inclined to donate a euro to a charity. as if it were to pay of for the sin that i had commited by buying this.  Do not bego the same mistake as i did. For your humanity ! 
4047	0	a	The game is horrible. The idea is good, implementation is very bad. I wouldn't even pay the 99 cents because nobody plays it.
4048	0	a	This game sucks in every way.
4049	0	a	Buy Primal Carnage instead.
4050	0	a	No i feel like I wasted 99 cents so yea its pretty bad
4051	0	a	Played the game for about 30 minutes. About 2 minutes in I got stuck in the geometry of the world and survived several waves stuck. And then I fell through the world. I really don't understand why anyone would say this is a good game.
4052	0	a	This game is very laggy and it isn't very nice if you dont know how to play the game. The dinosaurs are to hard to kill and it is very hard to aim the gun! DON'T BUY THIS GAME
4053	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!

4057	0	a	I would love this game if every five seconds I didn't crash. Now note I have a very nice and fast gaming computer. Other then that though the game is very well rounded although it needs a litlle work.
4058	0	a	I personaly dont like it if its 1 â‚¬ then u buy it but no at full price bcs its always same kill 30 mini dinosaurs kill 1 gigant kill 30 minis kill 2 gigant and so on
4059	0	a	It's horrible! The game play is bad, the graphics suck and overall it is horrible quality. Why did I even bother spending money on this garbage.
4060	0	a	Constant problems with server connection, ingame user interface was poor/poor game play. Did not feel like a complete game
4061	0	a	Killed some time on this game, so glitchy. I had fun though, guess it all comes down to who you play with.
4062	0	a	Terrible texture,animation and model quality, 90% of servers are either lagging too much to be played at or empty/full of afk players, over 200 useless achievements which is probably the place where the budget went(kill 100,500,1000 enemies with 'insert weapon name here'). Not even worth your bandwidth, more-so your money. 2/10
4063	0	a	Grab the smallest vehicle, the biggest sniper and rock the dinos hard. However, it is pretty much the same every single game. Defend this, capture that, return and defend. Over and over and over again. It gets pretty fast pretty boring. I played it for like 4? hours?! And i guess I have seen everything. I took the advantage of the free-days-to-play, but I dont bother buying it even for 99 Cent ...
4064	0	a	Game described in 2 words: Connection lost...
4065	0	a	Don't buy this. save your 0.99p on the sale!
4066	0	a	This is just horrible.
4067	0	a	I tried this when it was a free to try for x number of days. To me it wasn't a bad game, it just wasn't for me. It plays like a 3D tower defense game if you play solo. Which I dislike tower defense games. It has a lot of VS modes which gives it a lot of competative game play options. Which again is not what I was looking for out of the game. It looks like halo with dinosaurs but doesn't play as such.
4068	0	a	This game is terrible.
4069	0	a	this game is horendus â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. do not EVER buy it. everything is done wrong, its laggy, clitchy and even that the idea sounds cool, it is done very poorly.
4070	0	a	couldn't join matchmaking and single player was not fun or challenging. would not recomend buying
4071	0	a	its decent, have potential but the fact that you can just hide on something up high and never get hit makes it too easy :l
4072	0	a	There are a lot of things to do, a lot of modes to try, and a decent selection of weaponry but overall it is very boring, glitchy and slow.
4073	0	a	Game's a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but as with every game, screwing around with your friends and finding glitches in this game is fun.
4074	0	a	This game is tragically bad. The creators should drink bleach.
4075	0	a	Piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4076	0	a	I've had my heart broken several times in my life. Once, on Christmas Day 1989, I eagerly ran downstairs and gasped at the sight of what was clearly a crudely but lovingly wrapped skateboard. A skateboard that I had wanted ever since I had seen Marty McFly cruise through the streets of Hill Valley as a stowaway behind an unsuspecting SUV driver. A skateboard with a custom deck, with artwork that would cause my fellow skaters to shout 'rad'. A skateboard whose wheels would send me gliding across the streets as I headed for the nearest half-pipe. A skateboard of majestical proportion.  I grabbed it, and with shaking hands and a heart beating against my chest, I tore that festive wrapping as hard as I could. Through an intricate web of sticky tape, ribbon and ever expanding wrapping paper, I dug through. Years later, I wondered that this is what Andy in The Shawshank Rdemption must have felt like as he dragged hinself through the tunnels. My own redemption was in sight. My prize was near. Finally, the last shred of packaging fell away to the floor. And there it was... a plastic skateboard from the local store. With stiff plastic wheels. And a picture of a clown on the deck.   That's what playing ORION: Dino Horde felt like.
4077	0	a	this game is total dogshit. don't buy it. the developers are scammy as hell and tried to do some shady â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to hide from their terrible reviews. Don't buy it.
4078	0	a	Peter the Pterodactyl killed my friend
4079	0	a	Just no.
4080	0	a	i had higher hopes for this, it was very disappointing -_-
4081	0	a	1 of the worthless games i ever played too bad i cant get my mony back
4082	0	a	Where do I start... well this first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The first game of the Halo franchise, it was released on November 15, 2001 as an exclusive launch title for the Xbox gaming system, and is considered the platform's 'killer app.' More than five million copies were sold worldwide by November 2005. Microsoft released versions of the game for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in 2003, and the surrounding storyline was adapted and elaborated into a series of novels, comic books, and live action web shorts. The game was later released as an Xbox Original for download onto an Xbox 360 HDD.   5/10 only semi-enjoyable with friends. Other than that sucks major grunts ya feel me.
4083	0	a	boring
4084	0	a	theres a reson it costs a dolllar
4085	0	a	I GOT PICKED UP BY A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING TERRYDACTYL. NO ONE PICKS ME UP EXCEPT MY MUM.
4086	0	a	guns need better sound effects, open world is nice but leaves much to be desired, there is no cover to hide behind or in or building to shoot from roof tops or towers, no cities or city ruins to run a muck through... just a couple guns, open area to run around and dinos to shoot that spawn in waves. i would say it's 'back to the drawing board' guys. the game mechancis are solid and create a good foundation for what could of been a really fun game had they taken advantage of level design and gameplay is poor and instantly repetative.
4087	0	a	This game is so confusingly bad, I honestly cannot tell if it's intended to be shovelware or simply a product of poor production.
4088	0	a	About as fun as masturbating with sandpaper.
4089	0	a	This game gave me AIDs and that means alot because i got it for $1 
4090	0	a	A horrible, unfinished piece of buggy trash. Not worth $0.99. Broken animations, terrrible and boring gameplay, typical class system with a unfinshed upgrade store, just avoid. Run, run while you can.  -1000/10
4091	0	a	If you like hearing really loud beeping coming from your PC, piecingly loud, and enough to upset the whole family with no way of turning it off, your going to love this game.
4092	0	a	The metascore is NOT misleading, the trailer is. Do not get this game, even if it is on sale for .99 cents. DO NOT listen to the quotes in the trailer, those were probably from the devs of the game. Seriously though, this game really sucked hard and there were so many bugs and issues with optimization. Not to mention the animations of the dinos, which were some of the worst animations i've ever seen. Don't get this game.
4093	0	a	i should have listened to TB, this game is horrible, im running 2 titans and somehow this game still manages to drop below 30 fps on low settings, waste of time, horrible game. the mechanics are ok i guess, when they work right.
4094	0	a	It's really bad... its confusing, ugly, pointless and crashes all the time
4095	0	a	I have no idea what I just played, but then again, it's 0.99.
4096	0	a	Now I haven't played this game in a few months, but it's still safe to say for me that this game might not be what you are looking for. Now some might say that for the low price, it is not that bad, but I think it is actually pretty dull and boring. The gameplay gets repedetive after only a few hours and there is almost no variety. For one there is a pretty big set of weapons, combined with multiple (I think 4) Perks, but they are just soooo boring, and there is almost no sense of progression to be seen anywhere, what is especially disappointing for me. The graphics aren't to bad, but just like everything else in the game, pretty dull. The dinosaur models are alright, and interesting, but again, the playing just gets repetetive quickly.
4097	0	a	Hard on any pc even with graphics on the lowest setting... Take care when playing.
4098	0	a	Its like Jurassic Park, Halo, and Call of Duty had an abortion. Nothing else to say about it.
4099	0	a	Not worth it, not even for free.
4100	0	a	Might aswell cut you leg off with a spoon, cause this game hurts your soul by simply being in the main menu
4101	0	a	The Metacritic score isn't lying.
4102	0	a	still just as bad as it ever was...
4103	0	a	Absolute Crap, no wonder it was on sale
4104	0	a	I love how in the trailer the give us a bunch of random people who 'Like' the game and say it's 'Amazing' it's 99c for a reason. For you to think your getting a deal. If it goes for free for the weekend get it though, if you need to pass the time.
4105	0	a	If this game was paying you to play it then maybe it would have been worth the install.  This game feels worse than some of the 'Starseige: Tribes' mods I played more than 10 years ago.  The character animations are very clunky, most of the UI looks like it was made by a 14 year old in paint.  Weapons have no semblance of balance, the knife is the most powerful weapon in the game by miles.
4106	0	a	Very very good game! glitched around in a car for 20 minutes. 11/10 would play again.
4107	0	a	I just want to say tht the concept is cool, but it is kinda hard to play when the game won't stop lagging..
4108	0	a	tired of seeing this damn game in my library as free or in a deal. this game is trsah hence why its 1 dollar and they keep making this deals.dont get anddont waste your time.
4109	0	a	Shoot dinosaurs, get bored. Ai is terrible, some graphics belong back in doom or quake and the gameplay is bland. There is a ton of content but it all feels empty.
4110	0	a	this is no game 
4111	0	a	this game is crap the quality sucks and the price is a rip off
4112	0	a	wtf i purchased it and its telling me i didnt wtf,i hate this game thats not funny nor fair
4113	0	a	Horrible
4114	0	a	There are some server issues and not only that the game just keeps sending Dinos at you I love bears not Dinos
4115	0	a	Horrible balance. I watched 10 dinos attacking one soldier and it never phased him while the dinos dropped like flies to a shotgun. Don't waste your time. While I get the idea its just not fun to be on a side so severly handicapped.
4116	0	a	Half-Life 2 looks better than this game, which I can run on ultra with 60+ fps. My computer is fairly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, yet I can run a few games on ultra or even low and still get playable framerate. In this game I ran on low and got less then 10 fps, which is extremely unplayable. It may be bad because I have a terrible computer, but if I can run Far Cry 2 on ultra with 60+ fps, I should be able to run this on medium at least with 60+ fps.
4117	0	a	The gameplay is boring. In the PvE mode dinosaurs differ mostly by size and HP amount. Their AI is closer to Space Invaders. Real dinos were smarter than that. The guns are uninspiring and gunplay doesn't deliver.  Looks like something from 2003 with some effects such as motion blur and depth of field slapped on to mask the ugliness.  Wouldn't play even if I was paid to.   If you want a good co-op game look at Payday 2, Left for Dead 2 or maybe Killing Floor.
4118	0	a	t-rex stuck in a small tree... kinda say it all. it sucks
4119	0	a	Unless you are mentally ill, and or a masochist, who like to torture yourself, I cannot recommend this game. Its just a reskin of the older game, Orion: Dino Horde, still has the same bugs, broken mechanics and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balance.
4120	0	a	they should give us back our money 
4121	0	a	when i seen partial controller support i didnt think it was this bad... there isnt even a button for E so i have to put down my controller as a dinosour throws me through the air and get glitched into a wall. lol im getting off topic anyways when in wepons and adjustments menu i have to go to my mouse... the assignments of the buttons are so bad that some of the same buttons do differnt things   W8 M8.

4123	0	a	I unknowingly killed a dev and insulted the game in their face. I felt pretty guilty but then I thought, 'this game is so terrible adding Bubsy into it would make it better.'
4124	0	a	This is so terrible.
4125	0	a	A long time a go, I bought this game, 4 pack, because my friend also request it, but it turns out only 1 who really want it, so i keep the other 2, for trading purpose, but that was a mistake, nobody want this game, time after time this game price is decreased from 15$ into 1$, that was shocking, THAT WAS A HUGE LOSS. well, if that wasn't crazy enough, this game is free to play now, GGWP 10/10 will never use a game as investation again

4127	0	a	Terrible, just really, unfortunately bad. Laggy and buggy controls, poor gameplay, just not nearly as fun as it should be.
4128	0	a	Not worth $15 more like $.25 - $.99
4129	0	a	To be honest this is the second worst game I have ever played! It's even worse then civ 5 which is a waste of money. Never buy this game even if it is free.
4130	0	a	Remember Dino Crisis 3? Play that instead. This game is poop.
4131	0	a	It's buggy and rough around the edges, but it isn't completely terrible.  99 cents is a fair price for it. Anything more is a rip-off.
4132	0	a	Its fun at the very beginning of the game but gets boring at the end the fun will never last!!!!
4133	0	a	Hardly any servers to go on, single-player is boring as hell, and the graphics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 4/10

4138	0	a	If I knew what I know now about this game I never would have bought it I'd say the current price of 99 cents is a ripoff. Unless they changed every single broken â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing aspect of this piece of turd since I played it then its still the worst game I've ever played. And I've played some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in my day.
4139	0	a	Don't
4140	0	a	This is most likely the worst game i have ever played. I would literally need so many combinations of drugs just to tolerate the bugginess. Its legitimately horrible but its a great joke gift for friends.
4141	0	a	This game sucks in short. It has improved sence the last free trial but this game only live between sales on steam. The loby is broken and in total disrepair, the dino AI is crap and, the objectives are hard to find. At best this is a early bata game but not a finished product or worth $00.99.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct92YOQE3Ks 
4142	0	a	The metacritic might reflect a previous version, but it isn't that far off. Graphics are decent, flying around with a jetpack or the hoverbike is entertaining, but that's about where the good news dies off.  -Guns jerk around like the player is inside a paint mixer every time they pull the trigger. Using anything but a pistol is a waste against all but the largest of targets, sheerly because the odds of you hitting them while spazzing out is increased. -Tanks will get stuck or flip around if you get too close to anything. Anything. Even inside one, large mobs virtually one-shot you as they charge and gnash. The slam move they perform seems to have a 200 yard radius. Flying a heli late in the game is more about shooting down other flying enemies chasing you than helping your team directly with rockets. -Shooting lacks 'feeling' and there is a noticeable disconnect while firing. The enemies don't react to it, so combining those issues you more-or-less spam fire and wait until you see an enemy flop to the ground like a water balloon and aim at the next one.  -Guns sometimes don't even animate. You'll fire and see a flash but your avatar's hand doesn't jerk back, the gun remains frozen on screen. -Barring fliers and spitters, enemies cannot react to players on a cliff or anything other than a flat plane. Using a jetpack to reach something off the ground lets you fire at fish in a barrel as they pace around trying to find a way to reach you. -To limit this, flying mobs sometimes grab a player and lift them into the air. Shooting them drops you, which can easily be jetpack'd right back to where you were. Better yet, slowly strafe a foot left and right to avoid being picked up by them in the first place. -You can punt small enemies in the hoverbike, though speed doesn't seem to matter. Flying at max speed usually drops them, lightly tapping them usually punts them up or away a huge distance. My only guess is Aliens. -Did I mention this has an in-game cash shop, too? For only $50 you can get 75,000 coins to get skins, hats, and only the best priced bundles this side of Jurassic Park. -When you log in right now, you are promptly reminded that not only can you get this masterpiece on sale, but they also have a Kickstarter campaign starting in just over a day from right NOW! What are the odds of that? What luck!   End result: Thumbs emphatically -down-. If you like dinosaurs and cannot resist the urge, feel free to get it now while it is a dollar. Heck, get the four-pack so if any of your friends in the future, even long-term future, decide to want to get this, trade it to them for a TF2 hat or something. Spare them, anonymous review reader.   Spare them.

4144	0	a	For a dollar, I would say give it a try. However, since a dollar isnt how much it usually is, I won't reccomend this game. Now, I've only played two gamemodes, but they seem to be the main ones, nor have i put much time into this game. But here goes my first thoughts.  First off, I'll go over Survival, a classic Horde-survival. However, it seems very broken and simple. While on top of a building, well out of reach of a Triceratops, it hit me and sent me flying, even though there was no way that could've possibly hit me. The raptors and compies are also far to easy to kill, as they are unable to jump to reach you. This gamemode seems simply to easy.  Now onto Rampage. The Dinosaurs attacks have simply HORRIBLE hit-markers. As a trex, I bit right on top of someone, but the game simply didnt count it. The eggs also simply floated in the air, sometimes out of reach for most dinosaurs, when the carrier was killed in mid-air. The vision was also weird for me, and sprinting doesn't seem to make anything move faster, but that's probably just me.  Overall, try the game for free if you have enough space and feel like it. However, I highly reccomend against this, as the game is pretty broken in several key-aspects at the moment.
4145	0	a	Bought this game game for 99p and it feels like a waste of money. Incredibly linear, unloved and unoriginal.
4146	0	a	I can only politely describe this game as a waste of hard drive space. The issues are as follows. 1. Weapon names can be misleading, an LMG is a 3 round burst rifle, and a light machien fun with the LMG tag is further along. 2. Enemies will still spawn, and attack you, when it displays wave clear. 3. spawn and upgrade room defense turrets start the game broken and don't fix themselves. 4. player character models look hideous. 5. the multiplayer lobby system is unintitive, with as far as I could see, no start game or ready up functions.
4147	0	a	This game is not worth 99 cents. This game is not worth the time it takes to download, even on a fiber connection. This game is a finely glazed sewageloaf.
4148	0	a	This game blows goat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It was originally Orion Dino Beatdown, and I thought it had promise with jetpacks and dinosaurs...however only one class got the jetpack and it just had the biggest amount of bugs, crap ai, crap graphics, sounds and just about everything. Anyone who has ever played this warns anyone they can to not play and generally that its a waste of money....yes even at $0.99.
4149	0	a	I love how hard you're trying to make it seem like this game made a comeback! No one is playing on the servers that have nearly 900 ping...... Stop trying move on. I intalled then uninstalled 4mins later. This game still sucks people....
4150	0	a	it sucks!
4151	0	a	Wtf, it's not even worth a dollar
4152	0	a	This game has great potential; I've never though of a dinosaur based survival game. On the other hand, there are some things that need tiny tweaks and major improvements. First of all, I'll be talking about things that need to drastically be changed.  1. The AI for the dinosaurs need some changes. All that the ground dinosaurs do is, if you're on the ground, bolt after you with no strategy and try to eat you. If you're somewhere they can't reach you, they'll either start randomly running around not knowing which path to take to get to you, or they'll go and destroy the generator. Also, if you shoot a dinosaur it does not affect its movement; it will keep in charging at you until you finally kill it. 2. Very frequently I've been kicked out of a match for no reason. The game doesn't tell me why I've been kicked which is a major drawback. Those are two things that need major improvements on. Now I will list things that could slightly be improved on. 1. Animations for dinosaurs could be made more natural. Going along with the first thing I listed, If you shoot a dinosaur, they could flinch and/or stagger a little before continuing on with what they were doing. 2. Animations for the player have been a little buggy for me. If I reload my weapon, sometimes the magazine will fly into its place before the hand can move the mag into its place. If I equip a pistol, the pistol will be in its ready position without my hands and then my hands will come to hold the pistol. I think all of these things should be changed, and I hope the developer of this game sees this and takes action. I've heard this game has made improvements, but once these are changed, I will be able to recommend this game.
4153	0	a	The trailer is right: don't believe the Metacritic review. 36/100? I don't understand where they got all those points from..  If you enjoy things like: Loadout customization where your Primary Weapon choices are: 'Connection Error' and six other blank slots Bleeding ears after the T-Rex roars 20x louder than the rest of the game Crash on alt-tab Graphics from the 16th Century A wide variety of 3 classes that all spawn you with some kind of generic block thing Running 3000m to start the game  Then I would recommend this game for you, you stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
4154	0	a	Ok, so this game is a bit misleading... 'The metacritic score is missleading' Notice none of these quotes have actual citation... Because noone but the developers said it. Don't be fooled by the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t comments. Good thing it's on sale. This is the most revenue this game will ever generate.  WHY IT'S BAD: Ai is terrible, gameplay is simplistic and boring, artwork is meh. Don't waste your penny's. I fully intend to ask for a refund because I bought the 4 pack to play with friends.  1/10 (Because every game created deserves a little credit)
4155	0	a	You can get 6 cards from this game. I recommend you play the game until you get the cards, otherwise you're missing out on about six nickels' worth of value. The best way to play the game until then is to idle out in the main menu and read a book.
4156	0	a	This game has potential.. to bad the controls are all wonky and bugged. .99$ meh...
4157	0	a	This...game....is...â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! Do not buy it! It used to be called ORION: Dino Beatdown. Terra-bad game. Bought it when it was said title..
4158	0	a	Dont buy this 'game', not even for 0,99$. Not only is the game an unfinished, bugy piece of trash (even after YEARS), but the devs have shown on so many occasions that they are just in it for the money, and that they are willing to do EVERYTHING in order to milk the last cent out of this horrible 'game'. I could ramble on about how they tricked consumers into buying, but if you are interested just google it yourself you will be slain by articles of fraud claims etc. Total Biscuit reviewd some earlier version of the game, his review is very accurate.
4159	0	a	Before this huge update, the game was fun and I enjoyed it. But now I'm experiencing a lot of frame drops, bugs and other gui problems. Seems to me like this version was not tested enough and released too early.
4160	0	a	This is not Jurassic Park. 0/10
4161	0	a	This game has its moments, and it might be fun for the first 7 miliseconds but after that it gets rediculous, sadly the game had some potential. It has exciting graphics, and thats it! Don't even get me started about the 'eaten mechanics'. The game also suckers us (the consumers) into buying it with its few over-average screenshots. Please dont buy this....
4162	0	a	Update 29/06/16: My original review was for Orion: Dino Beatdown, which then became Dino Horde and now Prelude. Despite the game going through several name changes to put itself back on the steam frontpage for more sales and to reset it's bad review scores it's still an unenjoyable mess of a game with a developer surrounded by controversy of stolen assets and crowdfunding fraud. Read here for more info and sources:  http://www.thejimquisition.com/trek-versus-activision-how-orion-went-from-victim-to-villain-in-one-night/  Just because it's cheap does not forgive the fact it's a bad game and run by asset thieves, the shady dealings of the developer are well known and should never be supported even if the sale price was $0.01. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPERS GAMES FOR ANY PRICE.
4163	0	a	Sorry but once I played it.... It was horrible.. I didn't enjoy it.. I was excited about it, but yeah.. Hope the next game you make is actually being a dinosour, story mode. Would be awesome or having them as pets. I didn't get far but if you can do this in the game. Well that would have been interesting to see in trailers.. Something new and epic would be interesting. Not common and same as every other game. Even though this one had lot of different things, It's basic. But it had some pretty cool stuff too. more down than ups..
4164	0	a	This game actually sucks. Bugs, bugs and more bugs. DONT BUY
4165	0	a	Crashes on starting/joining, also in-game store is dull. Also it is not on Early Access. Money well spent.
4166	0	a	Well in my video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqNG5YizcE  near the end you can see the overall qualiy of this game. The graphics are kinda bad and glitches run rampant.
4167	0	a	Don't buy it even for a dollar. This game is bad and it doesn't improve at all. Occasionally game title changes; what will the fourth one, i wonder?  I'd like to make summarized cons and pros section for this review like most of my reviews but unfortunately i can't. Don't waste your time and money. Buy a cosmetic DLC, TF2/CSGO weapons, $1 valued bundle or just buy a snack for yourself. Just avoid this abomination.
4168	0	a	Should've been free. To many bugs and lag if you ask me
4169	0	a	You can customize characters in lots of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ways, but due to high techs armors it's not really funny and you need to buy these.. The game has nothing innovative. I didnt find it interesting although it's only 0.99 euro.
4170	0	a	
4171	0	a	Steam seriously needs to get its quality control in order. This is an unplayably buggy piece of trash.
4172	0	a	I have one word to describe it:lag
4173	0	a	heavly bugged and has no orginal content that isn't stolen from other games
4174	0	a	Very bad graphics and the game is still lagging, a lot of bugs, boring game (and yes even with friends) i'm sure that you can buy something better than this game.
4175	0	a	Really really not worth your time due to bugs, bad game design and almost nothing to do. It makes the tutorals of MOBA's look good as you find out what kills you as you die again to no apparent souse.  This game is for when your drunk and want to rip the @Â£$ out of a game while making bad T-Rex jokes.
4176	0	a	Dang it. why did I let myself get fooled by the trailer. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. And it looks so GOOD in the trailer, lightsabers, mechs, dinosaurs. sounds like a recipe for fun.  Unfortunately tons of velociraptors in your face that instantly blur because the textures blow isnt fun. guns that have a muzzle flash after you fire isnt fun. No tutorial what so ever isnt fun. microtransactions arent fun. And gameplay elements that are terrible.   I gave up playing as a velociraptor in thirty seconds because you cant strafe so the only thing to do to a human is run right at them. No way to out manouver, and considering the humans can kill you in two seconds.. Even as a human the game felt grindy and unpolished. You can unload TONS of ammo into the larger dinosaurs and get no results and not even anything to let you know they are taking damage apart from some out of place looking numbers on the screen and a bad looking blood splatter. Now, I don't usually care if graphics are bad. But I want my bulltes to line up with my fire, I want to not be the wrong colour and have no textures for three seconds after spawning, I want what feels like a complete game for my money.  At this tage, I have to recomend you save yourself tha embarassment of trusting this game to deliver.   EDIT: Ok they have recently made an update that seems to follow a particular theme, that theme, is that the devs are doing what they can to provide continual suuport, adn are constantly improving the game, basically all the issues I covered here have been fixed. so the game is ok now.
4177	0	a	The survival gets extremely boring after 2 games of it. It ends up getting way too hard and without the weapons saving or loadouts saving its not worth the money.
4178	0	a	'If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything'. That about sums this game up for me.
4179	0	a	piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
4180	0	a	The factor is that this game is simply terrible. When I first picked up this game, it seemed like it was going to be something fun to play with friends. Boy was I wrong, first off lets take a look at graphics. Listen, I know that graphics are not everything but this game looks like it was thrown together in a day. The animations are so very basic and so crappy that it truly does take away from any positive gameplay expierence. But perhaps your the person that could care less about any type of graphical fidelity and instead are content with a good gameplay expierence. Too bad it doesn't provide good gameplay either. The game is full of glitches, such as during a wave of dinosuars, the dinosaurs remaining count doesn't change at all, leaving you with a never ending wave. Or perhaps the factor that only certain dinosaurs bring down the counter, despite the factor that there is not a singal indicator as to which dinosaurs to kill. Then lets look at the factor that this game has so many elements from other titles. Now, there is nothing wrong with utilizing previously exsisting features in games to improve your own (Borderlands 2 driving mechanic, fight to revive etc.), that's what helps push the industry forward. Sadley this game does not have an original bone in it's body, and the features it does take from others, it does incredibly poorly. Overall this is a pass, I would NOT recommend buying this game.
4181	0	a	Alt+F4 does not work... it really should because i wanted to stop playing AFAP 2/10 would not bang
4182	0	a	Probably one of the worst games ever made.
4183	0	a	I tried playing this game, but not even the slightest indication of how to play or what you are doing is given. 0 out of 5 stars.
4184	0	a	I purchased this game when it was $1. I mean for a $1 game, this game is decent and actually you can say it's a good price for what you get, BUT at $15, the game is just not worth it. The gameplay is basically what it looks like, slaughtering dinosaurs wave after wave until you just win the game. The gameplay is super repetitive and gets very dull easily, I guess it's a little more fun when you play with friends but still, the gameplay is the same each time. Reading the positive reviews about ORION, I'd have to say this game must have been a lot worse without all the updates it has had. I enjoy the game and all, but I would not recommend it if there are no discounts. There is supposably a big update coming this month, but I will change my review then if my opinion has been altered.  The Pros: - Co-op, play with friends!  - Vehicles: Jeeps, Hovercrafts, Tanks, Robots, and more (Fun!) - Dinosaurs: T-Rexs, Stegosaurus, and some other fairly big ones - Just a LITTLE character customization included  The Cons: - The gist of the game, very dull - Repetitive gameplay - Limited class choices - Small array of guns to select from - Limited amount of players in servers - Limited enemy types, considering it's a dinosaur game, there are a very limited type of species. (All there is is regular raptors, pterodactyls, and the larger version of them, then the big dinos that are similar to bosses) - Limited map selection (Maps have sub selections which allow you to switch the game from day to night and vice versa, but... it's still the same map) - Limited game modes  - There is no real motive to the game, it's just for fun (If you don't include achievements)    
4185	0	a	Launched it 2 times. 2 crashes in a row. 10/10 Auto-delete.
4186	0	a	Don't waste your time.
4187	0	a	Though fun, the game falls horribly short as the dinosaur. They feel unpowered, squishy, and mostly target practice. Where this is good playing as a human in survival or even in versus; It leaves much to be desired as the supposedly powerful beasts. As the smaller dino's, you're so soft that you can rarely take more than one quick shot. The larger ones seem so clumsy and slow that it's nearly impossible to hit the humans. It could really do with some rebalancing of the team/species-based combat. The solo play is fun, and playing humans v. humans is also enjoyable, if not reminescent of another scifi shooter. If you wanted to play this game simply to be a titan, squishing puny humans and eating them up, this is not for you. If you wanted a good online shooter where you can switch targets between walking fossils and other sacks of meat; then you've come to the right place.
4188	0	a	don't work on windows 8.1 64bit, nvidia gtx 780 x 2 sli with 32gb ddr3
4189	0	a	Great idea for gameplay, horrible execution. The game environments look alright, but the character, weapon, vehicle, and building textures look like they were made by members of the Unreal Tournament community over a decade ago. I don't understand how a game engine can have the kind of performance issues that this game suffers from, even when all the settings are turned low, despite the fact that it doesn't look as good as other titles I've played (that perform better). The gameplay leaves me asking questions like: Why is the generator so far away from the other buildings? Why don't I have enough time to get back and buy weapons and upgrades between rounds? I also find myself asking questions about the originality of the game, such as: why does the tank look like a ripoff of the scorpion from Halo? Why are we fighting dinosaurs of different time periods, millions of years apart? Why aren't these like, primordial alien monsters that resemble dinosaurs (we are futuristic soldiers)? Why does the menu music sound like a cross between Battlefield games and the action score of Pirates of the Carribean (which already sound similar)?  I read a review last time I tried a free preview that stated the game still feels like it's in alpha. I agreed with it. I read a recent (community) review that said they've improved the game since then. My recent experience proves that to be mostly false and I still agree, it needs a ton of work because it still feels like it's in alpha.  Biggest problem: how is this not a free-to-play game if it has its own store?
4190	0	a	There's a good game in here.. somewhere.  The gun and vehicle play are solid and there are sparse moments of real squad camaraderieâ€Ž.  However, they're the exception and not the rule as lousy UI, poor squad communication (someone just hit the 'Follow me!' voice bind. Who did it? Not displayed.) and incredibly frustrating player death (wait 10+ minutes for the round to be over, and all your stuff is now gone.)  The item loss on death can be mitigated by unlocking permenant character gear through levelling, but the players who need this boost the most -- the newbies -- are completely left out. As a result, it's not uncommon for a new player to join up on wave 6 with nothing but a pistol and be completely slaughtered before he can earn the credits to get anything else. It's kind of heartbreaking watching a dozen of these players join your game, get murdered, and leave, one and two at a time.
4191	0	a	This Game even on sale is a real dissapointment, but because of the marketing strategies used by the dev's they make this game look like game of the decade so dont get suckered in and bight the bait. All and all there isnt much to enjoy playing this game even with friends because the whole game is as the title sais; you are killing hordes of dinos and nothing else ever sure there is fancy guns mechanics and vehicles but it doesnt take away the fact that its only killing A.I dino's. It would be the same thing if tetris threw in mechanics to send blocks backwards and get upgrades its still just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing blocks
4192	0	a	Very poorly made game. Logic is cringeworthy but it has it's moments. Would reccomend ONLY on cheap sales.
4193	0	a	Kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but still dumb entertainment, recommended for the $0.99 price tag as opposed to the $14.99 price tag unless you are dumb enough to buy it at that price...
4194	0	a	NO, this game sucks, look at the old players from 1 year ago have to pay 6euro, now just 1 dollar, just not worth it, this game's developer should do something about it, because just changing the price over night ain't change the fact 1 year ago it was 10 euro!  Edit and add: the game became positive for some reason let me see what people see in the pros?  Pros: Memeing every possible way of killing a t-rex Memeing every possible way of bugging out Memeing every possible way of the potential nazi t-rex invasion  Cons that i see for myself: -Sluggish animation that is even worse than Ride to hell -Guns work like free FPS browser game -Dinosaur bugging the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of u if u are in a vehicle  1st the Aligator will bug out in the water with the rest of the dinosaur if u are in a jeep that face backward to them at the begining of the round 2nd T-rex are sometimes invisible  3rd Flying dinosaurs are the worst thing to kill cause they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bugging out at the top of the skybox 4th Helicopter is the worst maybe worse in some case as it cant shoot flying dinosaurs without flipping out 5th Tanks will fly  - Map design are too big , making an attempt for (open world) . And there is a mode called open world but it is just a bigger map with some random crate that have the same modes of other maps in various part of it
4195	0	a	Just no no stop looking at, yeah you dont even for a second think of buying this turn around and go buy something else this is not worth time, Download, Hard drive space, or anything. Trex mechs no noooooooooooooooooooooooo 
4196	0	a	The thing is about this game, it is poorly made, bad shooting mechanics, bad AI, driving vehicles handle worse than GTA IV, and the slow motion is annoying (but can be disabled upon further discovery). Orion: Dino Horde is the re-release of ORION: Dino Beatdown. Just a copy/paste of the game to get a new score on Metacritic, but still recieves its old score of 36. You can't really customize your character, that part is microtransactions. You want to be red? Too bad! Have pitch black instead. Trust me, it doesn't really look good either.  But, there is a few good things Fun co-op Hilarious ragdoll physics A great game to make fun of.  I only got the game because it is 1$, as this game isn't worth 15$ in my book.
4197	0	a	Where my dogs at man? Where my medic dogs at man?
4198	0	a	probably the worst game on steam
4199	0	a	after watching the first trailer on store page, and read the 'comments' in this video i thought 'wow that must be really cool- so much positive comments - and wow they say its like killing floor and borderlands and turok. wooow'. but it was not.  after few seconds on title screen the backround music makes you puke. then startetd the game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphic, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sounds, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ viewmodels, no atmosphere. this game maybe good.....if you are 12 years old and we have the year 1997 and you re totally in halo or dinosaurs.
4200	0	a	WARNING THIS IS JUST ME RANTING ABOUT HOW â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND UNFINISHED THIS GAME IS.  The rant: This game is a cheaply made clone of halo trying to be original by throwing in some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dinosaurs. At first I was excited when I booted up the game and played for a few minutes, 'aww yeah this is fun' then it hit me these guns all feel like toy guns that shoot little plastic balls and feel really underwelming. so you are either shooting at enemy players that all look like a ridiculous version of Zero from borderlands 2 but with more LED lights glued to their suits or you are shooting some stupid as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dinosaurs. It is full of bugs, glitches and this game should of at least been finished before they released it. Oh wait this is the finished product, let me just shove that Â£0.59 up my â™¥â™¥â™¥. Oh and all the maps are big open planes with a few rocks and if you're lucky a puddle of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing water.  The pros: This game would be okay if you were playing it with friends for less than 30 minutes before deciding to go back on PAYDAY 2 because all your friends you were playing with have killed themselves.  Thanks for reading, now im going to go play with my balls.
4201	0	a	I saw a lot of reviews said that this game offers a lot of fun for a cheap price.Well,that's not entirely true.It's just too boring for me.The graphic is mediocre,the animation is dreadful,the guns have 0 recoil and it's pretty hard for me to find someone playing online since I play from Indonesia.I can't feel the survival thrill like in other wave survival games.It's just too unrealistic and illogical.It's not worth your money,unless you'll want to pay for boredom in a couple of hours.
4202	0	a	&gt;Last played February 21st 2014  As it should, and always will be.  I really have no idea what they added since then, but based on what other negative reviews have said, I don't think I have any other insightful comments to add, so I'll just a story if you want to read more.  I got this game in 2014, probably the 21st of february to be exact, all because someone I knew back then told me to get it to play with them. They really enjoyed playing this piece of tosh $1 arena dino shooter game at the time. Well I guess their taste in this game was indicative of them overall, garbage. The end.  Just play TF2, Dirty Bomb, any other F2P game besides this.
4203	0	a	Terrible Halo ripoff however it's still mildly fun for a couple of hours to play regardless of how bad it is.
4204	0	a	This Game is a Dinosaur.
4205	0	a	Since it got free to play for a few days I decided to give it a go. I'm not a real fan of shooter games but if they're interesting I play them. From the videos I thought I should give it a go.   After installing the game started and I was scurrying trough the options (I always do). Out of the blue I got my first achievement, yay! Anyways, after that I decide to 'Play Game' apparently you first have to FIND a game so I did that. However the room list doesn't update and it takes forever if you make one by yourself (because it doesn't update for anyone)...   So I went solo. I don't like solo. But hey I tried! Apparently the goal is to steal eggs and drop them off somewhere, while you keep shooting like a madman on the dinos. However the game wasn't very smooth for me so aiming was not an option, and you can't shoot while carrying eggs. I tried many, many times to do this game and when I finally put down the T-Rex, IT RESPAWNED. Yay! So you can't even really finish this game anyways because you get â™¥â™¥â™¥-raped the whole time -.-  Sorry to say but, personally I absolutely hated it.
4206	0	a	I do not recommend this because it's a buggy, unfun mess.
4207	0	a	Worth the dollar to laugh at how utterly terrible it was, but only barely.
4208	0	a	Nice world. Great Trailers. But sense of accomplishment? Nah.  Single player (solo) in 'noob mode' should be removed from the gameplay options for the maps in this game. There is no noob mode as it suggests. You arrive on the map with a timer to find everything you'd need to be wearing before the waves of dinos start, but you can't look for those things until you turn on the generator which is how you start the first wave, a generator which, for some amazing reason, is located far from the base where your weapons and augments are located. If the premise is that we're establishing ourselves on some alien planet we know is habitated by dinosaurs then why would we put the generator some 150 yards from our main base? One could say it'd be because it'll explode if it gets too severly damaged, okay, then it would also injure badly and/or kill whatever made it explode too. None of this appears to have been happening.  -The dino flyers that attack enroute to the next base we're supposed to capture disappear too quickly or take a flight path that makes hitting them extremely difficult for the new player (differnet flight paths, aggression, etc., in noob mode would have been a great consideration).  -The vehicles were destroyed rather quickly as well.  -There's nothing but a sign over a building that gives any direction, nothing inside to show what station or location in the building of your base you're supposed to use to get weapons or an augment. No tutorial walking you through your toon's options either.  -When the triceritops (I think it was) had killed me and the game went into fight to survive mode, the dino walks away and I am moving at a crawl, unable to carry out that fight, though it said I have 3 lives left, apparently there is no actual rez, just a fight in almost dead mode where you can't even follow the assaulting AI let alone fire at it.  One might think I am asking for a finished game (as I see this has a kickstarter). No, I am asking for the game to be thoughtful of the new player they decided to have a free weekend for (February 20th-27th). If they're trying to sell the game through that free weekend (and thereby also sell kickstarter contributors) then this was their opportunity and though the executable code seems pretty clean and well done, which I do greatly appreciate, the chance for a new player to appreciate the actual game, to have the fun seen in the videos is just not there in the first run experience.  When we compose from a letter to a written story, maybe better said as author a letter or story, to communicate something we are to write to the reader or we'll have failed to communicate to those we want to express something to. Games, and the industry as a whole, are communicating a story and are always looking for new players, yet, their considerations of game design in relation to telling their story seems to follow whatever path the experienced and elitist gamers say is good. These are given preferential treatment in influencing the game design and often of closed alpha and beta relationships. Their input is great for those areas of the game such experience would lend itself to aiding in the design of, but for the new player and selling a game to the vast audience it has potential to reach, the gaming company listening to the entrenched 'professional' game tester, as with this game, finds the game has a very narrow appeal, and that the gaming company ended up designing their game to a player 'first time experience' in an elitist vacuum of these types of gamers whose playing of the game alone will not afford to keep the servers open. Thus the free game play weekend is wasted if its intended purpose was to elicit a large enthusiastic interest of new and highly energized players.  And remember that this free weekend isn't just to sell a game but is also an opportunity to sell it well enough to gain those new players as kickstarter contributors. This will be very difficult to do when the first impression, that first time one plays the game it seems to have entirely ignored that first game play experience, to have failed to give that first time player an overwhelming positive emotional response that brings them to want to continue the game to see what's next, and, to help develop the game further by contributing to the development -- a desire to have a direct connection to whatever comes next in that development.  I can't recommend the game or say it's a good game, I didn't get to go that far and only know how my first experience was worthless in regard to feeling exhilarated, feeling good about the game, and having any sense of accomplishment -- all of these were lacking.   For what I played, however, Spiral gets an A+ for code that's clean and well written, that had no graphic or other odd issues and for creating a visually appealing world that through videos sold me to try Orion: Dino Horde.  I hope they keep at it but know that they can only rewrite the first experience by assuring the one they offer is well scripted to achieve as broad an appeal as they can while well informing the player of how to play, so the learning and achievement are mutually occurring and help give every new player an incredibly positive player experience where their sensation from this experience creates an obvious knowledge that the game designers thought of the player first and their need for newe players to assure the game's longevity. This will also aid in making sure noob mode is easily identifiable for the new player (meaning we know that we can try harder modes and thus want to experiment, the first step in gaining our desire to play and become immersed in the game and its world).  In summary, what I am saying is that if Spiral doesn't design to achieve a large and enthusiastic player base (that will naturally come from new players) then the future of the game is dim, and to take the time to play a game that has a short life span is only good if you're sure you weren't going to play this that long anyway, but if Spiral's design and idea is to have a long standing game then the first consideration should be the new player and making sure these are plentiful and will, over time, not require a free-to-play weekend to gain. It'll be a great game if the same integrity that went into the coding of the game goes into the game's design considerations and map option characteristics.
4209	0	a	June 2014 I've noticed massive improvements since launch, but it's still a terrible game. The narritive voices are a joke, and are only there to hide the fact they don't have proper dinosaur sounds. Every dinosaur pretty much behaves the same way, they just rush at you when you get within a certain distance, and some have ranged attacks, or fly, but they are otherwise the same enemy. The game has a choppy and unpolished feel to it. It's cool that they are adding new things to the game, but the game really needs some polish rather than new game modes and items.
4210	0	a	I just bought and played Orion: Dino Horde because it was on sale for a buck. I immediately regret this purchase. I knew the game was under development hell but itâ€™s just so bad. And the community is worse than the game itself. Itâ€™s just filled with kids who think the game is better Call of Duty but even Call of Duty has some polish. Itâ€™s just so bad. The controls are so clunky even after changing the terrible default key bindings. Movement and aiming feel so stiff. There are so many missing animations. Guns sound and feel like peashooters. Even rocket launchers look, sound and feel weak. The art design looks like your generic scifi shooter. The music is bland. There is just no redeeming quality about this game. Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I canâ€™t believe something like this is even on Steam. It feels like an alpha build but it isn't. Itâ€™s a full game that has been officially released for 2 years now. And the sad thing is that was a kickstarter project. I almost feel sorry for the poor shmucks that funded this now obvious cashgrab.
4211	0	a	This game is so broken. I haven't experienced any actual bugs, but the Dinosaurs are so overpowered that all the gamemodes aren't even that fun. Survival is okay for a couple of hours, but it is the only DECENT gamemode. All the others are just boring, overused by most games, and if there are dinosaurs involved, considerably unbalanced. For this game to go on 93% to get some sales just shows the desperation of this producer...   I would give it a 4/10 at most, and that is being generous. This game is pretty much a waste of a dollar, so unless it is on sale that much, I highly recommend not getting

4217	0	a	- create a public room - a friend join - start game - wait for the 1st wave to start - wave start attacking - shoot at dinosaurs - client crash (2/2)  E5, NVIDIA 1060 6G,  This issue needs fixing before I can re-try this title and write more of my experience. Currently not recommend.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  I wanted to give this game another try, so I launched it on another PC with different hardware specification. This time it worked. So the above issue is only about hardware compatibility. However, now I encountered another issue:  - create a solo survival mode room and start gameplay - fight and capture the side objective point - mount a battle vehicle and continue to fight - a Triceratops appear - drive the car toward the dino and hit it - car get tossed over  Found: the view angle auto-switch to 1st person. I'm still inside the car. whatever button I press, like 'w' to move forward, the game mysteriously paused. the only way to walk around is by pressing Space button. But once press other buttons again, the game will enter pause state again. A dead cycle. Have to reboot the client. So appart from the gameplay itself, I still can't recommend this title on current stage.
4218	0	a	 Unless You Have Friends To Play With... Really Only Worth It For The Trading Cards
4219	0	a	i want my money back.
4220	0	a	this game is garbage tried playing several matches and the game performs so poorly, yet it keeps going up on sales, it's not even worth a dollar  
4221	0	a	This game might be cool. If me and my friends could actually play together without 'cannot connect' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.   Not worth 15 bucks at full price or 3 dollars on sale.  This game is st00pid.
4222	0	a	So I am going to be rather honest with this short verdict, if you are expecting miracles or top-notch gameplay or graphics, stop reading and avoid this game like the plague.  This is essentially a multiplayer game, one with co-op and versus options. You have your stereotypical bore options such as capture the flag, or we can actually explore the aspect of the game which is any different, the co-op mode versus those pesky dinosaurs.  The menu is rather broken, click refresh too many times and you need to reboot the game. It is essentially a bad version of Natural Selection 2's. You can tell why the game got a metacritic of 30, and after a year of updates, it is probably in the range of 50 now.  Getting in the game has its own issues, there doesn't seem to be good/dedicated server support, so you would end up joining some random guys game, most of these are stuck on the lobby with the host inconviently afk browsing x-rated sites, so I recommend perhaps starting your own game like I did. Wait for a few people to join, which tend to come like buses after waiting 5 minutes, then the game starts.  There are three classes, assualt, support and recon. I haven't played support, so I won't comment on that, but out of the other two options, I found Assualt to be the best. Recon has a really good cloaking ability, with some upgrades you are essentially invisible to the dinos and with a stealth weapon, it doesn't break, when getting attacked, cloak makes the dinos run after someone else too, making you totally vanish to them. However, energy is limited and it will take a while to get to that point, which leaves assualt. You might go 'Cloak versus a Jetpack, cloak sounds better..' but the thing is, most dinosaurs cannot jump, so even with the beginning, you can clinb upon a big rock and be untouched (save for spitters and rock throwing t-rex, and flying dinos). So it is consistently good from the start, and with upgrades, you can fly around almost carefree out of trouble.  You basically start in an augment building, the 2nd is a weapons building. If you set 5k as the beginners amount, you can go over to the weapons building to buy an assualt rifle, If not, you will need to do waves, which will get you money quickly since popping a dino is an easy 100-200 credits. weapons range from rockets, rifles, lasers, snipers, bow(!) and others.  You will get access to vehicles depending on the mode, with survival being unlockable after taking bases. You have swoopers (like out of starwars), jeeps (think warthog), a mech, a tank, and a helicopter.  The enemy AI is rather simple, it is a combination of mindless running around until they spot you, trying to take you like a female dino. Most of your time will be spend running around backwards and shooting them, unless you are on a big rock, then you shoot them from that as they cry foul of lack of long arms to climb after you.  Despite a lot of negative comments and feedback from the above, I actually ended my first couple of games. I audibly expressed 'aaagh..!' as I was getting chased down a slope by a t-rex, trying to jetpack away with no energy, firing wildly at it to try to kill it (we did! i survived). It is definitely one where you enjoy the novelty of the concept, plus, I really love co-op games opposed to single/competitive.  The game does have good controller support whilst in the game (not for menus). You would want to make some keymapping adjustments so it fits the typical console fps setup, but it works rather well and it is playable. Only downside is the slow aim-moving, since petradycals attack you in a frenzy like a moth to a lightbulb, which I found a lot easier to handle with m/kb.  Overall, the game is 5/10. It look and feels low-budget and it definitely does not have any polish on it.  However, if you got a few friends who are interested, pick one with a good rig/connection to host, talk on skype/ventrilo/mumble, get a drink and have a laugh. If you don't have any friends, you will probably play a couple of games and not bother more.
4223	0	a	Do not buy this game. I bought it when it was under a different name which was Orion Dino Beatdown that game was a buggy mess and so is Orion Dino Horde DO NOT be fooled by it's new name it is still the same piece of trash when it was first released. This game has a small community if you can call it that and the servers are dead the peak is about 60-80 players. The guns feel like cheap knock off BB guns and the AI is just bad then combine that with the dinosaurs getting stuck in objects such as buildings, rocks and mountains that sort of thing. This is by far one of the worst games I have had the horrible misfortune of playing sure the devs seem to be making a vague attempt to make it playable but with it's dead servers and bad gameplay with a dash of microtransactions make this game a slap in the face to the gaming community and hard working devs who produce top quality games. Do not support this product at all.
4224	0	a	When you paid to get f2play game that feeling is priceless...
4225	0	a	To be fair, the games not too bad. But thats it, its average AT BEST. Sadly its not horridly broken which wouldve honestly made it more enjoyable as sometimes glichy randome events are fun but thats not the case. I only gave it a negative review becasue i spent like $0.40 on a 4 pack of codes, which are now completely worthless. Thanks Spiral Games.

4230	0	a	NO DAD I DONT WANT TO TAKE MY PANTS OFF
4231	0	a	I tried this game on a free week. It always attracted me because of the nice screenshots and the coop mode, but because of the previous failure from this developer, I always retained myself from purchasing it. I'm also an indie lover, and I can bear with bugs and underdevelopment if the game is actually good and fun, and this one looked like one such case from the conflicting comments of the players.  The reality is this game is not actually fun, but funny. I laughed so much when I played it, because if you can do anything wrong when making a game, you'll find it here. Even the graphics, that looked like the only thing that was made good, looks so weird because of the bad animations (or lack of in some case).  The gameplay is a lagfest, even with a low ping, and amazingly it also affects animations, that will lag aswell, making it look like an old cartoon, when animations were made with just 3 drawings repeated forever.  Nothing is fun here. The shooting, the driving, the walking around for miles to catch up with teammates, the lag, the animations, the gameplay.  Seriously, this game has potential, but looks like a v0.2 of an ongoing free project made by an amateur team. And, for now, even at 91% off for 0.99 euro is not worth the time spent purchasing, downloading, configuring and playing it.  Go buy a bundle with those money. The worst it could happen is you'll get five bad games instead of just one.
4232	0	a	This game is trash the controlls are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the combat is teribad. Humans are favored in this game with more then one attack, unlike a dino. this is by far the worst dino game ever. Prepare to die and lose everytime if your a Dino.
4233	0	a	Where to start....  I played this game when it was a disgusting clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of bugs. It was as horrible as their trailer depicts it to be. I played for maybe 30 minutes before I had enough.  It has come a VERY long way. However, it is still astonihing to me that action propmpts are still missing (it took me about 3 waves to figure out how to purchase weapons, and an aditional 3 to figure out how to get reloads). Granted, most of the game breaking bugs are gone, but don't expect your gameplay experience to be close to what the trailer sells. YES there are high intensity moments...every few waves.  The controls are ok. Except when you are trying to hit flying enemies...that feel closer to puppets following a rail. Then you have to have very precise aim, else they will smack you and fly away. Or, play it risky, get the shotgun, and wait up until they are about 90% in your face before you take your shot.  The game, to me, is not worth $1. This game feels like a F2P that would beneffit from a microtransactions scheme. Seriously, not for me.
4234	0	a	I bought this games and its F2P now? Do i get a free in game bonus?

4249	0	a	So my freinds, i have played 20 hours of this, more than i have played bioshock infinite, and here is my reveiw. Its not even open workd you're consrtantly defending a power genarator against din osaurs, but if you have a freind and two space helicopters it's extremely easy, or just get two rocket launchers, you get the choice of a knife or a gun that can provide you with infinite ammo and repair cars. Dinosaurs A.I is just suicidal, the multi-player is just 20 t-rex's standing outside the humans spawn, The audio is garbage, oh and the thing that makes every game worse, MICRO TRANSACTIONS! is there potential? If they re-did the audio worked on the dinosaurs and made it actully open world, meh. I dont know how this isnt listed aas early acess, it looks and feels like one. Unless it goes on sale for a dollar again, NEVER BUY IT! i've been told killing floor is better, which at some point ill get and look at, this reveiw of hitting a terrible game with a stick starts my writing reveiws
4250	0	a	This game is so freaking bad. I'd be hardpressed recommending this game for $1, don't be fooled by the interesting looking screen shots. This game is extremely 1 dimentional and quite unrewarding.

4256	0	a	A good game for being only 0.99 cent , it has some issues like poorly optimized and also high ping , fps is not good sufficient , it freeze sometimes and my opinion for this game is 'I just wasted my 0.99 cent'
4257	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.

4264	0	a	I don't get it. This game went through so many name changes, trying to shed away the bad opinions of the game because the developers are supposedly working so hard on it. I bought Dino Horde because it was cheap, played a little, and clearly saw the flaws right away : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design. Apparently though, so many reviews of people begging players to give the game another chance because it was much better now than it used to be. So I downloaded it again...   First game : I load a map, I shoot, the gun is immobile. The hands/arms animate, but not the gun... Fine, it must be because the game isn't started, right? I need to find a generator, maybe it will animate after? I find a generator, walking very slowly because everything is sluggish, the game start, the gun still doesn't animate, but now it doesn't animate while a dinosaur is seemingly stuck in a circle in front of me.  Maybe the map didn't load right? I exit the game, start a new one, choose a new map... It's the *same map* as before, but with pumpkins, cell shading and a laughter track added. I play around a little, I die, next map loads. They ask me to choose my class, I don't, I press escape, I am brought to a Spectate other players screen. Weird, it was a solo game. I press escape, I am brought to the main menu, but the map is clearly still loaded in the background.  So in 5 minutes I am faced with the same issues as with Dino Horde : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design.   Why are reviews saying that this game changed for the better? It did not. Adding cel shading to a map doesn't make a game better. The player's animation and movements are all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. When we jump and touch ground, we get a foot smaller and then pop back to full height. Guns don't animate. Gun's impact particles are oriented with the walls, not with where bullets come from  I have a download cap when I live, no ISP offer unlimited bundles, and yet I re-downloaded it based on all the 'This Game Got Better' posts. I feel like I was robbed of my bytes here. This game is *not* better than it was. I'm deleting this game and I will *not* fall in the Orion trap a 3rd time.
4265	0	a	rubbish even for a free game!!
4266	0	a	I imagine that HIV would offer me a more enjoyable experience.  Weapon handling is utterly boring. Sound design is atrocious. Animations are stiff. Horrible usage of post processing to cover up low-res textures.  It's a game you buy and there's also a cash shop. It was crappy with Guns of Icarus Online did it, too. But, GoI Online was fun. This isn't.  Pass on it.
4267	0	a	Steam should be ashamed to have this in the marketplace.  Worst game that has ever been made.
4268	0	a	OK, I did not mind the game, heck I am astonished by how it had improved since I last saw it when it was Orion Dino Horde *Watch that video by Total Biscuit by the way, I'm not being paid for it but he's just fantastic.* However it has problems which turned me away from it, or at least 2 problems.  Littlest one: The game is not very well optimized, I play this on a laptop but given I can run some high speed stuff with no problem, this is a problem....Though it is one that CAN be fixed so I will not hold it against the deveolopers.  However our biggest problem: The Community, sure the games can be fast but honestly, no one helps you either because the game doesn't do a good enough job of telling you 'Oh your teammate is down', and even if they did, there's a number that would let you die just out of SPITE, often killing any dinos you shot so that you would NOT get up.  Overall its an OK game but the community...just the community is all.

4279	0	a	Just... wow.  I regret the decision to even download and play this title.  I came into the fray with optimistic thoughts screaming loudly 'THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD'.  'Cause 'Turok mixed with Halo'? I love both titles? Damn right I'm going to play this, I have to. I didn't even know the history to Orion: Dino Horde, or what Dino Beatdown even WAS. They weren't even on my f**king radar, at ALL! Now I completely see why.  But god damn what a f**king lie that was because the entire game is executed so badly, the high expectations that it set itself begin to smolder into a pile of broken Alpha-testing nonsense, yet this is DEVELOPED and RELEASED at that. Going to mesh two good games together is aiming to pull alot of fans of both types of genres and when you invoke such f**king power words like that, you need aim well and aim high to appease both audiences because the bar has been as such by those previous titles. But oh man, you guys pulled a number on me good, man.  (You might as well sub out the 'Halo' bulls**t and replace that with 'Tribes', because that is the only thing that screams to me besides halo. A bad Tribes clone with dinosaurs.  Every gun in the game has around a 100ms delay for firing and for hitting a target, so you have to probably calculate the Coriolis effect before you hit anything thats more than 50 f**king meters away from you and it's worse if it's in the sky.   Everything feels like its clunky and runs like its just an amalgamation of crap, and the fact that when youre playing and you die from...oh lets see.. a f**king pterodactyl immediately lifting you off with no regard or warning, or a couple of small dinosaurs that you cant even see because the grass texture is so tall and its dispersion is not very good whilst the dinosaurs in question are hidden in plain sight until you're on your back pockets bleeding out attempting to shoot at them to revive.  Theres another thing, the dinosaurs. The pinnacle of this game is the dinosaurs, right? Wrong. That couldnt be more far off from the truth. Because you might as well be fighting newborn babies in the form of giant lizards that are radioactive to the touch. You wont know that youre getting hit because the animations for your foes are so terrible that when they do them its literally NOT what theyre actually doing. ------ Example: Dinosaur walks up and is right in front of your face and you just hurt terribly for some reason, no animation, no nothing its just a roomba moving at you with dinosaur legs attached. You move away and eventually it begins to do an animation for a bite in your face that does nothing, until you stop then you begin hurting because the vacuum is back on again.  Example 2: Be me and my friend, on a boulder next to a cliff with a tree on it, stegosaurus walks towards us and looks at us and and a floor stomping animation sends us up into the air out of nowhere but the dinosaur did nothing but look at us. It could have farted and I'd believe it at this point. Then it raises its front legs to stomp us because im right infront of its face it would definitely hit me again. It lands and nothing even happens, we didn't even move. What?   Man I'm already tired of thinking about everything in this game that I encountered that im not going to continue much on this anymore. In the THIRTY SIX MINUTES that I played I encountered so many things that would put me off of it I wouldnt even consider replaying this until they redo it entirely. (OH WAIT YOU DID THAT?) Well too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad, make it again. Or dont. Either way until you do better this game WILL NEVER CEASE TO EXIST. IT WILL NEVER GO AWAY. IT CANNOT BE UN-DONE. ARE YOU PROUD? IS THIS A CONSPIRACY TO TARNISH SPIRAL GAME STUDIOS?  This game tells me nope.

4284	0	a	Just... wow.  I regret the decision to even download and play this title.  I came into the fray with optimistic thoughts screaming loudly 'THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD'.  'Cause 'Turok mixed with Halo'? I love both titles? Damn right I'm going to play this, I have to. I didn't even know the history to Orion: Dino Horde, or what Dino Beatdown even WAS. They weren't even on my f**king radar, at ALL! Now I completely see why.

4285	0	a	this game is a peace of $h!)  sorry but it is and i want my money back
4286	0	a	Not good, shady practices, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was only 49 cents!
4287	0	a	WTF, THIS SUCKS, NOW IS F2P, WASTED. I QUIT THIS GAME CUZ IT'S â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ LAGGY. HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHOLE GAME TO SPAWN BACK. SUCK LIKE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4288	0	a	A great concept with poor fit and finish, Dino Horde/Prelude has come a long way but has farther to go before securing a lasting place on my hard drive. Score 6.0
4289	0	a	This game is like the last guy to be killed by Kony before everyone stopped giving a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about him. Forgotten....
4290	0	a	It says that I own this game so I am reviewing it. It is not a good game. I have not played the game, but I have read what people are saying about the game. They don't like it. Plus, how good can a game be if it was released for $15 but now is routinely sold for $1?  I also think that the developers may hate dinosaurs. Don't support saurian prejudice.
4291	0	a	I only have this game because I bought a four pack so I could taint my friends' libraries.
4292	0	a	i played this when it was free, and basically it's alright, if it were 15 years ago. sadly, it's not, and this 'game' can't hold up to today's standards, not even to indie standards. what fun is coop if the ai ain't good, the guns ain't satisfying to use, and the game is repetitive all round?
4293	0	a	OK, I did not mind the game, heck I am astonished by how it had improved since I last saw it when it was Orion Dino Horde *Watch that video by Total Biscuit by the way, I'm not being paid for it but he's just fantastic.* However it has problems which turned me away from it, or at least 2 problems.  Littlest one: The game is not very well optimized, I play this on a laptop but given I can run some high speed stuff with no problem, this is a problem....Though it is one that CAN be fixed so I will not hold it against the deveolopers.  However our biggest problem: The Community, sure the games can be fast but honestly, no one helps you either because the game doesn't do a good enough job of telling you 'Oh your teammate is down', and even if they did, there's a number that would let you die just out of SPITE, often killing any dinos you shot so that you would NOT get up.  Overall its an OK game but the community...just the community is all.
4294	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
4295	0	a	its a dollar. still plays like â™¥â™¥â™¥ though. why do i have hours into this? thats a good question.
4296	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
4297	0	a	They made it free to play, but I don't think they can save it in the long run, it's just not worth it...  A lot was promised, little given, but that's my own fault for buying early access, so I shouldn't complain too much. I only post this review so that others are aware of the way the devs/publishers of this game operate, for when they release their next game.
4298	0	a	The Co-op in this game is quite fun to play with some friends, but i wouldn't recommend buying this game as it is increbile buggy if your are going to play solo. Also the developers appear to be rather nasty people. D:&lt;
4299	0	a	Steam should be ashamed to have this in the marketplace.  Worst game that has ever been made.
4300	0	a	After getting into the game I said 'It looks like the entire graphics design budget was 2 cans of Mountain Dew'. After playing for a while and seeing all the bugs and glitches I said 'Nevermind, the budget for the entire game was one can. I was in the process of figuring out how to refund when I noticed the option to write a review. I'll continue after this. If you want to waste the (fortunately very low) price of the game, go for it. But don't expect a well made game, or even a decently made one.
4301	0	a	poorly optimized and also high ping
4302	0	a	About as fun as masterbating with sand paper.
4303	0	a	Runs poorly for the size of the maps and the graphics.
4304	0	a	While the game might well be worth the dollar price it dropped down to, I cannot recommend the game simply because of the actions of the developer. The game was buggy, simplistic, and took a few tries to get to work, but was an amusing dino horde game. I'd be the first in line to recommend it for a few bucks.  However the name has been changed twice in an effort to throw off previous negative reviews, and I've heard numerous stories of saying the developer didn't propperly compesate his employees. If you don't care and just want a cheap dino horde game, this might be for you. Personaly I'll wait till the next one comes along.
4305	0	a	Not good, shady practices, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was only 49 cents!
4306	0	a	A game that cost 0.99 cents, is worth 0.99 cents. Dont expect much much from it.
4307	0	a	ENG:  It's change into F2P -model what was absolute 'NO' -for me so, i don't recomented that a game any more.    FIN:  Muuttivat pelin F2P -malliseksi mikÃ¤ on ehdottomasti 'EI' -minulle joten, en voi suosittella tÃ¤tÃ¤ peliÃ¤ enÃ¤Ã¤n.
4308	0	a	Its not bad, but definitely not good  graphics are really not impressive, but considering i got this game for less then a dollar you get what you pay for.  gameplay is pretty poorely done in my opinion with so many other clones out there that have done it so much better even for free.   Connections for gameplay are just bad in the best case senarios and when you have to rely on fast twitch movement and need smooth gameplay to make good shots. Without that a FPS is nearly worhtless.  3/10
4309	0	a	this game is so bad, it's so laggy and you can shoot dinosaurs through the wall like the good old early 2000s counter strike. Such a bad game. Not even worth my 1 dollar. Dont buy it.
4310	0	a	This game is pretty much Halo with enless waves of dinosaurs but with terrible graphics and terrible physics. Even if it is on sale I would not buy it. And if you do get it, make sure you look up a tutorial first, it does not tell you how to play the game. The maps are HUGE, which is good and bad. Good because you can roam around and get away from the dinos easily. Bad because it sometimes spawns you on the OPPOSITE of the map you are supposed to be and with no vehicle. Overall do not buy this, it is a waste of money, I have no idea how this has so many good reviews.
4311	0	a	This game is ok it has a few bugs and it is just dead its fun to play with friends but if you want to play online, theres just no point.   I woud rate it 5/10
4312	0	a	This game needs to make it's mind up weather it's a free 2 play, or a payed game.
4313	0	a	Basic wave survival and was not worth the money (even your spare change). Try it if you want to get some trading cards or to pad out your Steam library.
4314	0	a	This game is literally cancer, whatever you do... don't even consider buying it! It first wants you to pay for it, and then pay for in game currency, just after you bought the game. Worst... P2W... game... ever!  Edit: they changed the name... again!
4315	0	a	Awful game, waste of 99p
4316	0	a	This game is like a cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, fun for 20 minutes but it gives you a disease after you play with it. Would not recommend.
4317	0	a	When I played this game back during one of its myriad of free weekends, it was a half-baked piece of garbage that wasn't all that well put together.  When I played this game during this current free week, it definitely showed some improvements and the horde mode is OK but it's still not all that well put together. It also has one of the worst Instagib modes I've ever seen, the kind of Instagib where it is just easier to run up to the guy you're trying to shoot and kill him with the butt of your rifle.  Frankly, this game was more entertaining when it was a complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing mess.
4318	0	a	I tried to like this game, I really did. While my friends were calling it garbage, I defended it. The truth is, however, that they were right. I never played Dino Beatdown, and I didn't bother with the Metacritic score; going off of some brief gameplay videos I figured that while the animations looked clunky it could at least be one of those games that is fun to play with friends. Those videos don't quite prepare you for Dino Horde, and I can safely say that even at the price of $1.00, I would not recommend buying this game.  The animations are bad, and in fact very laughable. Running looks like you've got a stick up your â™¥â™¥â™¥ and when you're in first person in a car you can often watch in horror as your weapons wiggle around. However, these animations are typically situational - no, most of what you'll see of the animaiton quality is in the dinosaurs themselves who often come off as cartoonish, rigid or downright broken in their movements.  The gunplay is very unsatisfying. Everything kind of just haphazardly squirts blood when you shoot them. You'd expect such a loud game to at least have some great, satisfying sounds to accompany each shot, but they don't. Every enemy is a bullet sponge and each weapon is unpleasant to use.   However, the most frustrating failings of Dino Horde is in the fact that when buying upgrades in Survival, dying will cause you to lose them. Additionally, despite boasting a large number of game modes, many are just not fun. The worst was where you're forced to play Support and just stand around as raptors spawn out of the air on top of you, trying to last as long as possible.   The only positive points I can truthfully give this game was that the vehicles were at first very fun and interesting. If you're forced or tempted to play this game, jump into a vehicle as soon as possible. The only difficulty you'll really find with vehicles is how their tires are somehow incapable of running over small dinosaurs. However, even they were not enough to save Dino Horde for me. I will not be reinstalling this. If you want a dinosaur game get Natural Selection 2 or Primal Carnage, a lot of ORION's assets were ripped off from those games, anyways.
4319	0	a	ORION: Black Ops 3 is a highly original game.
4320	0	a	Even after the update and name change, it's still the same bad game as it's always been. Buy DIno D-Day and/or Primal Carnage instead. Both are much better dinosaur games. 
4321	0	a	I've only put a half hour into this game but..  What the hell is this game?  No, seriously, look at actual reviews on it. It feels like a game made in Unity engine using 3D assets you'd buy in a pack to use (but the reality is they just fired the workers that created them after they handed them over). The idea that this game could ever get a 10/10 (as shown under reviews) is ridiculous. This entire $1 sale is just a con to squeeze the last bit of money they can out of this turd of a game.  Do your research before buying it, you'll see a trail of unpaid workers, crowdfunding scams and general distrust over this developer with only a little bit of googling. No reputable person or gaming website would ever give this game a rating over 10.  Bugs, bugs everywhere, assets that clearly weren't made for this game.. the list goes on.  Stay far, far away from this.
4322	0	a	What the actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this mess? Honestly, this is the worst game I've ever played on steam.
4323	0	a	Avoid this game. Broken beyond repair and it's just no fun this way. Had some hopes for this game as a fun survivor shooter, but broken mechanics, overwhelming amount of bugs make this game unplayable
4324	0	a	Paid for this game get nothing extra when it goes free2play. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off
4325	0	a	Lol besides the fact that they changed the games name...Its a pretty bad game
4326	0	a	This game is garbage. The devs are shady scumbags that have changed the name of the game twice to dodge bad Metacritic reviews. Look up Orion: Dino Beatdown and Orion: Dinohorde. Those two games, and this one, are all the same. Their other game, Project Orion, was taken off steam because of a valid DMCA by Activision where these devs blatantly stole assets from Black Ops 3. And now they are trying to bleed more money out of gullible steam users by having an indiegogo campaign that was allegedly to let them fight Activision in court, but has now been changed to claim its to make up for damages Activision has caused them. Don't fall for their lies. This game is garbage. Project Orion, or whatever they decide to change its name to, is garbage. Don't give these people any money.
4327	0	a	What could have been an awesome game is ruined by bad performance and even worse FPS mechanics. It just isn't fun.  Verdict: PASS
4328	0	a	They changed the name of this thing three times, now.  and, now, it costs only 79 cents. They probably don't know any other way to grab cash and go.
4329	0	a	Don't even bother. Even if it remained F2P forever, it's terrible. SWTOR tier.
4330	0	a	'we will not be pursuing legal action...'  ...because we would lose so fast our heads would spin.   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DEVs that steals assests, lies about it, gets caught lying, then gets all defensive and self righteous when the whole communbity turns his 'evidence' upside down on his â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ filled head.  for the record, those photos which 'prove' he didnt steal assests have been pretty much proven to be lies as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s of better non biased photos showing clear copying have surfaced.  for the record, I think Activision are a bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s too, but at least they put the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on a nice silver platter for you to see before you eat it. and they don't rerelease the SAME game under different titles to try to cover up negative reviews...this is now the 3rd or 4th name change since 2012.  oh, the game you ask?  .... it sucks.   it has and pretty much always will regardless of all the stolen COD/starwars/other assets.   (keep in mind I paid 10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dollars for this garbage back in EA) *(working on refund for Gaming's sake)* deleting it regardless to make my own point if it fails.  gonna go play a GOOD game, like ARK.
4331	0	a	Literally an atrocity.
4332	0	a	Orion: Dino Hoard is an extremely bad game. I also think it's pretty cheesy. It's just a wave defense game featuring dinosaurs with bad servers and a dead community.  Bad gameplay, bad online multiplayer, bad story (it's non-existent), bad production value, bad developers, bad time.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  **Do not buy Orion: Dino Horde!!!!!**  And this ignoring the fiasco of how bad it was when it was Orion: Dino Beatdown and then having the developers change the name to get rid of the negative stigma (and reviews) surrounding the original game - this is a review of the current game on the market! It's terrible.  Don't take my word for it though:  Reviews:  Impulse Gamer - 4.5 / 10 - 'Dino Horde is not the improvement Dino Beatdown needed...it never feels like a finished product...this goes deeper than just a lack of polish...rudderless.'  NZ Gamer - 3.0 / 10 - 'Shoot in the back of the head and bury it. Awful. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played. Unplayable. Abomination. Broken.'  Gamespy - 1.5 / 5 - 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs in the same game? How could this possibly fail?...the same way as if Jurassic Park had used sockpuppets for the dinosaurs and someone had accidentally set fire to the final reel mid-way through the premiere.'  IGN - 2 / 10 - 'Painful. You probably deserve a beatdown if you waste your money on this disaster.'  I cannot recommend this game in any way, shape, or form - it's not even a worthwhile gag gift for a friend. Don't even buy it for your mortal enemies as the developers are shady. ORION Dino Horde is a stain on my Steam Library and if I could remove it I would. It is easily the worst game in recent memory that I've EVER played and I have no problem giving it an F
4333	0	a	a whopping 0 playerbase. not even worth a single dollar.   10/10 main menu simulator
4334	0	a	Wish steam refunds existed when I paid 14.99$ for this pile of garbage. Might be worth it at 99 cents but not at what I paid. I'd say the only real selling point of this game is that it has dinosaurs.
4335	0	a	This is the worst game ever created all things considered. If a free Android game is bad, you don't really care because your expectations were so low to begin with. When a Dino game is this bad, it can be considered to be near the top of the list of worst games of all time. With the budget and the supposed good reviews this game received, David Prassel should be sued with a major class action lawsuit of everyone conned into buying this game. The graphics are terrible, the dinos were mindless, and the multiplayer is idiotic. There is no strategy, the maps are way too open and large for nerds to play. With the jetpacks your game becomes broken as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  9.9/10 ~ IGN legit reviewer
4336	0	a	Just an awful, awful game. Even at the cost of a Euro the price is too steep.

4339	0	a	It's like Left 4 Dead but with slightly more advanced weapons and Dinosaurs. Oh and vehicles. Oh and there's no map that you progress through, in Orion it's more of just defending a generator (which for whatever reason these Dinosaurs have a vendetta against) and occasionally running away to capture some point that has no relevance to anything. You also get an in game currency for killing the dinosaurs which you spend on other weapons, which are quite expensive. There's a microtransaction shop as well in the game which is a huge turn off even if it is a very cheep game. Third person animations are ridiculously stiff. Also what's with this misleading 'Work together to survive the devastating Dinosaur horde in huge, endless environments.' on your store page? Is it huge or is it endless? It's neither. How can you legally just throw words like that around when it's completely untrue? 3/10, Dinosaur poop.
4340	0	a	 Worst Game Ever!  [static2.wikia.nocookie.net]  
4341	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i buy this game before now it's free
4342	0	a	Let me just start off by saying this game looked cool at first, but then i actually played it and boy was i wrong. First off all the weapon variation is absolutely abysmal, its either assault rifle that shoots chocolate covered marshmallows or a flamethrower that will give the dinos a slight tan equivalent to a nice day on the beach. The dinos look and behave like pidgeons that have been fed bread crumbs laced with weed. This game is absolute trash and writing this review was a huge waste of time as was downloading and playing this game. Having this game in my library disgusts me. Please remove this game from steam so that nobody has to go through playing this pathetic excuse for a game. If i were to sum up this game in one word, that word would be Pathetic.
4343	0	a	First off, The devs of this game, Absolutley â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Everytime this game gets too many Negative reviews on steam or Metacritic they 'Update' The game (Breaking it even more) and give it a new name. The HUD? Absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. They were too lazy to change the Menu icons to keys instead of xbox buttons. Even when you have this game at the highest settings it still looks like it was made in 2006. The lack of difficulty is baffling also. After killing a few of the easiest dinos you can go and grab yourself An lmg, SMG and upgrades to your ability that is determined by one of the 3 classes.  TL;DR: Its a terrible port from the 360. Barely even worth $1. I Got it for $0.27 and i would gladley take it back.  Update: Many people cannot gandle the truth
4344	0	a	Baaaaad game.. Stay away. Horrid sound effects where they exist at all. Feels and moves cheap. The animation is amateur. The lighting is horrible. Menus are clunky. When you die the game just instantly goes to a loading screen.. no idea even what just happened. I could go on but it's worth more effort than the game is worth.
4345	0	a	Where do I start with this game? I don't even know HOW to describe it. Its like dinosaurs, future tech, and master chief all jumped into a blender and was then consumed by the game developer. Time passed, and so did the product through the developer's intestines, leaving us with this 'game'.

They were too lazy to change the Menu icons to keys instead of xbox buttons. Even when you have this game at the highest settings it still looks like it was made in 2006. The lack of difficulty is baffling also. After killing a few of the easiest dinos you can go and grab yourself An lmg, SMG and upgrades to your ability that is determined by one of the 3 classes.  TL;DR: Its a terrible port from the 360. Barely even worth $1. I Got it for $0.27 and i would gladley take it back.  Update: Many people cannot gandle the truth
4351	0	a	Horrible graphics Laggy for no reason â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ maps Full up cancer Randomly getting kicked from matches They worked on this game for 3 years and its still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  
4352	0	a	Look how many hours I have spent on this game. Look. Just look. Probably 110 of those were on Orion: Dino Horde.  Since the upgrade to Orion: Prelude the game is just an utter mess. Sure, it looks 'better' but al the 'fun' has been sapped from it. I've tried to play this game several times since the 'upgrade' and don't think I've finished a single game on it.  They added *more* stupid flying dinosaurs and made them harder to shoot. They made the 'Compy' dinos harder to kill. They made it so that when a big dino 'stomps' the ground you go flying further in a car than if you're on foot. They made it so you can be flying with your jet pack and still be affected by a stomp on the ground. Honestly.  Add to that the fact that when they said they had ironed out loads of bugs and made it better when in reality what they really meant was they made the best gun on the game less powerful than a hand gun that you start with and introduced bugs that weren't even in the previous version then you start to get a great view of the actual 'upgrade'.  Is this game worth 79 British Earth Pence? Sure. I would have paid more than that for Dino Horde. Probably more like a few quid. But it's now just sat there, dejectedly, in my Steam library. So sad.
4353	0	a	This game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad, I wouldn't give it to my one year old neice to play. Everything about this game is absolutely terrible and is broken to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. How the hell did they charge $20 for this game when it came out, This isn't even worth it being free; it's just a peice of garbage on my computer. But as for the game play driving a car sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and is laggy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, every gun is absolutely useless and doesn't work, many of the animations are broken; and they're making another one! That's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke. Please nobody buy this game, don't even consider looking at it at all; it's not even worth the space on your hard drive. I played almost an hour of this and I regret every second of looking at it.
4354	0	a	This game has some very nice maps though some of the things are too spread out....very nice objectives....and some not too bad models for things. Even the controls are not too bad....  The problems though.....wow....alot of them...going to slowly go down the list here.  Like int he game 'Killing Floor' the enemies simply go in straight lines try to get to things....like for example if you are playing the protect the genrator....they will go to the generator...no matter what like a homiing missile....only good thing is that the developers ont his game improved the engine a little bit...so unlike killing floor the enemies dont ignore up down physics.  If a player gets in a certain radius of any dinosaur....they become the next magnet...all enemies ignor everything else and go after that one player. The only time they lose interest is when the player goes into fight for their life mode.  Weapons....i dont know...they seam sub par.....they do barely any damage.....i was one shot killing by using the standard melee attack and because the AI was so bad.....i just had to stand in one spot....let the line of enemies come at me while i punched them all....didnt take much skill.  Grenades seamed to not work much at all and the grenades and my own gun fire seamed to be able to destroy the generator more then it could the enemies....and when i say grenades didnt work much...out of 20 being thrown, only 3 seamed to detonate...kind of annoying.  Another issue aside from the magnet enemy AI and poor performance weapons...my character always seamed super fragile...and my powers seamed kind of pathetic....like the assualt guy gets a jet pack....which is sort of neat yet any form of fall and you take massive damage....in real life i can jump of a 1 story building no problem...in this game such an act gets me badly hurt....yes i am inthe future with advanced armor and unable to survive very well...the irony does not escape me. The recon character class gets a very short sub-par cloak field....as in everything sees through it.....but then with the way the game auto tracks to you well guess thats just how it is.  Now when you die...you do get a fight for your life....which made me laugh alot....because as soon as you get to that state the dinosaurs ignore you and run off....and weirdly enough your weapons start doing even less damage. I had to melee 3 times instead of 1 time to kill things....that actualy made me laugh on the bad mechanic.  The game mode i played had a genrator i had to defend ala like a tower defense....waves of enemies would hsow up to assault that generator from all over. Each wave made enemies stronger and also would introduce new enemies. Between each wave i was given 60 seconds to spend cash i had recieved for killing enemies.  Ok first off the generators are always far away from the resupply points...you take 20 seconds to get to the those points even while sprinting....bad machanic....they should have made it so you can buy what what you want then maybe activate the generator to start the next wave....but no...the made a stupid way of doing it....ala like killing floor.  now each wave shows how many dinosaurs you have left to kill....these are shown with markers over them.....unfortunately anothe rbug makes more enmies appear inthe game who will randomly appear right be hind you or somewhere else and attack you.....again a flash back of killing floor and its poor game system.  Those random not needed to be killed enemies will appear right behind you...no matter where you are...inthe air...on a cliff....back to a wall.....suddenly you are getting hit....you turn around and see a dinosaur is on top of you and the wall and attacking only you.  I dont like games where they suddenly appear like that....with no defense....doesnt make this exciting...just makes it stupid.  Purchase of weapons requires alot of cash to get them...you wont be able to buy the next pistol untillyou have killed 10 enemies....you cant even by a rifle until you kill 30 of them.  My total time playing was maybe 10 or 15 minutes....why so little time to pass judgement....my game library on steam and raptr, and xbox live, and u-store...and a plethora of places speaks for it self.  I am biased...becasues i have played really good games and played really aweful ones...and this one although its not the worst....its still bottom of the barrel....i am surprised the meta-critic score is not lower. Persoanly i would rate this a 10 or 9 out of 100.  In my opinion the develoeprs failed bad onthe AI and the spawn on top of players mechanic. They failed on the run to the store to buy new stuff in 60 seconds mechanic...and they failed onthe cloak mechanic whihc doesnt seam to work.  Multiplayer death match following these mechanics simply will make the matches un balanced and no point to play...as it will follow the system the winner will get cash to buy new slughtering devices to kill faster and better while a person who is unlucky and loses to much will be left far behind.  I dont recommend this game to anyone in its present state....the being on sale for a dollar....well not sure if its worth the trouble to get it.   Pictures onthe site do a great job of showing its art work...game play though is not getting shown at all...they show movies....but no real game play...and the reason is becasue its not too good at all,
4355	0	a	needs to be optimized for amd graphic cards
4356	0	a	Incredibly underdeveloped, Incredibly broken, Incredibly boring. Stay away from this.
4357	0	a	Beware this game is not for everyone.  I give it 6/10 and here's a few interesting things about it.  The game feels like a Halo 1 mod. The locations, the power armor, the weapons, most of it's design choices. You could pretend you where playing master chief and you'd feel somewhat at home.  There's a reason for this beyond the art style. It's because many of it's game resources where lifted or â€œstolenâ€ from Halo 1. I've played Halo 1 for 5 years give or take and I've really got to know the game, it's physics, it's weapons, maps, everything.   Playing Orion: Prelude I saw a warhog, then I saw the exact same animation when you get off the turret. Then I saw animations from using the melee button from guns. You also realize for a new game it sure looks like it came out in 2001 same as Halo 1.   I had no idea this game was a kickstarter, and it's a perfect example why I've never supported a kickstarter and probably never will. (including paid Early Access).   https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/orion-prelude/description   The number of things they say in the Kickstarter and it ends up just all being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Even the in game shots look nothing like this game when you play it. Just watch the video and then compare it to screen shots and videos of the actual game. They promise things like a deep lore, etc. I'm sorry this is just a Horde mode game, and a easy one at that.  The game itself is lots of mindless fun, but so many other games do everything this one does better. There is no sense of challenge, you can easily go on a mountain and shoot all the dinosaurs out of range. You have many weapons and augmentations you can buy to make turn this game into Very easy mode even on medium settings. I can't say for the higher settings.  The game does lack polish. Things like getting stuck in graphics, warping dinosaurs, unpolished animations, etc. When I said it feels like it's a Halo 1 Mod, it sure does due to it's unfinished quality.   The creators are already on their sequel so I wouldn't expect this one to be polished, they probably learn that from EA games.   In itself the game can be lots of mindless fun, but don't expect anything amazing, just like a cheap mod, it's fun to try out, but rarely better then the original.  A few annoyances;  One thing I'd like to point out, you know how in Halo 1 the sniper rifle leaves a white trail, well in this all the bigger guns seem to, so after a while you only see cloud lines and not your target so well. Then you got rain on your screen, you know the dripping water, I was never a fan of this. And in this game it's constant. There are a number of things that make it harder to see your targets but it's mostly just annoying and pointless. Especially then it's raining on your screen in third person view.   I bought this game for 1$, I would be willing to pay up to 2$ but no more. If you want a good horde mode game I'd say Killing Floor tops this hands down.   This is the type of game you have fun messing around and shooting easy targets, but you'd probably never recommend it as anything worth wile. Not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but not great.

4367	0	a	This game is reeeeally boring. I regret buying it. I regret a lot of things. But most of all I regret dating Jenny for five miserable years.
4368	0	a	This game is a scam. Valve is backing up scumbag developers and allowing false advertisement on this Steam page and not allowing refunds. These developers fired their dev team and took money for themselves using a KickStarter campaign. They have stolen props from major video game companies and small dev teams. They released this game in a pre-beta state. They are using false advertising tactics to get people to purchase this game.   I've supported Steam since 2006, and this is the first time I've been disappointed with Valve for allowing devs like these onto their store, and then fiercely defending them on the Steam forums and on Steam Support. I cannot be issued a refund of the four-pack I purchased because of the Steam Subscriber Agreement. However, they falsely advertised this game as a complete build, and they are using the agreement as a way to prevent having to take a publishing loss.
4369	0	a	I can tell you before it got its makeover it was pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I played the makeover for a few minutes and that was pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as well but it looks like they updated so i might reinstall it
4370	0	a	I remember when i bought this game for $16.00 what a rip.
4371	0	a	I might change my opinion, but for now, my review is short and to the point - like my play expirence. It SEEMS like a really good game, and soloing with bots it feels like it would be fun with a group, but joining a server is impossible because of the numberous issues that come up.  Yes, yes - I know the forums list solutions, but there are a zillion to try and they are insanely involved - more so than one should expect to go through for any 'finished' game. This feels like a buggy alpha, not a full release.
4372	0	a	Did not like it, felt horrible and bulky to play, UI is horrible, idk how there are so many good reviews?! Lack of server hosting, customisations is minute to nothing, would not play again, did not enjoy  3/10
4373	0	a	The game has horrible optimization and it crashes all the time.
4374	0	a	What do you get when you release a buggy game, with stolen art assets that are slightly modified, glitched sound files, and gameplay that randomly restarts? Orion: Dinobeatdown.   What do you do when the community rages at you for it, do you:  A: Create new art assets completely from scratch. B: Smash the bugs as quickly as possible. C: All of the above or D: Rename it something else, add another game mode, and don't do anything else?  Well, these folks went with choice D.  D, For Don't Buy. Not Dinosaur.
4375	0	a	This is a Terrible UT mod. Ideas stolen from other good game out there. Changed, and made bad. Really awful animations and poor game play with extensive maps that are really boring to get around.   It sounds cool by premise, but honestly, this game sucks hard. Avoid it!
4376	0	a	Don't buy it. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on almost every level, and no where to be worth $8.99.  Bggest issues are sound cutting out, constant crashing, horrible and ugly UI, dumb AI, god awful animations for everything.. etc. Another reason not to buy is because the guy who created it is a crook.  That is all I have to say.
4377	0	a	MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS ARE A JOKE  I am at least double the requirements of this game and cannot play at anything but 1fps on the lowest settings!! Fix this game and I will change my review 
4378	0	a	Awful textures from 1998, hideous color schemes, poor draw distance, ugly menus, the worst sound design and weakest musical score you will ever hear in a game. Ever. This game is bad and a major waste of your money.
4379	0	a	  Cool game but i dont play it very often.
4380	0	a	Even at a dollar this 'game' isn't worth it. Developers are shady, gameplay is ancient. Level design is a joke. Nothing is intuitive. This company deserves no support what so ever. They even turned off comments on their facebook. i want a refund.
4381	0	a	this game is absolutely terrible. i bought a 4 pack when it first came out. (at full price) they its had its name changed twice since then. terrible terrible game. dont believe my hours played either. the game didnt close and kept running in the background. save youself some money and shoot yourself in the leg for the same experience.
4382	0	a	waste of time and money.
4383	0	a	its badly designed,not very good looking, not very fun and not even worth 99 cent, and the metacritic score is misleading it should be under 20 percent 1.5/10
4384	0	a	Terrible game.
4385	0	a	Did they make it horrible on purpose? After how many years and this is what you came up with? How does one make unreal engine look so horrible... if not on purpose.. There are a ton of built in smooth animations for free in the engine that apparently they didnt use. And those textures??? wth.. are we still in the days of quake? and physics are horrible.. you get stuck walking next to a wall.. If this was a school project.. id say Nice work! you're def going to make a great game after you graduate.. but .. its not , its a full release of a 'completed' game that from what I hear the devs take pride in.. I know I wouldnt.. at least make the textures and models look a little better that would be a good start. Oh and the sounds... ugh.. am I firing a cap gun? anywho..
4386	0	a	Even thought this game is free on Steam right now.Do not play it.It is competely unfinished and is unplayable.The game constanly lags(even in the menus) and isnt even gpu or cpu demanding.Please spare yourself and avoid it at all costs.
4387	0	a	Even if you were being paid to play it, it would not be worth it.
4388	0	a	Don't waste the time it takes to download this.
4389	0	a	pretty awful
4390	0	a	It crashes. A lot.
4391	0	a	its a piece of garbage im sorry its so bad i cant even describe it in words  
4392	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. terrible port. if you want to play alone you're good. but if you want to play online, you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. this game can't multiplayer very well.
4393	0	a	this could be fun if i could connect to a server...
4394	0	a	The trailer for the game made the game sound so good and so hyped but in the end result there was just no action.It turned into more of a hunt down dinosaures the size of a skittle.Even for a dollar felt like a rip off.
4395	0	a	Horrible graphics swallowed lage â™¥â™¥â™¥ cracks
4396	0	a	literally garbage
4397	0	a	This is a very clumsy and bad game. Fuzzy controls, horrible game play and sub-par graphics. Seriously overpriced even at .99 cents. Download the free weekend version for giggles and mourn the disc space and band width wasted. The metacritic score is not a lie. Couldn't stand more than five minutes of this stuff. The dinos do look rather nice even though they move like sorry stop motion animation puppets. Maybe the devs should reprogram this game as a screen saver?
4398	0	a	Concept is great, but all I got while playing it was a game designed for human characters, with poor handling on the dinosaurs and other reptiles. Difficult to navigate and figure out how to play in the first place.
4399	0	a	its awful, simply awful
4400	0	a	Thought this woudl be fun with some friends. Lasted for 2 hours, it's just too clunky and slow. Getting into the same server is a pain, and play is just not great.
4401	0	a	Blood Vomit. All over. Rotten Apple out of 10
4402	0	a	horrible game does not work do not buy it is so horrible don't buy it don't pay for it
4403	0	a	Honestly...this is my opinion, and mine alone...but this game isn't as fun as I was led to believe it was. Granted, my frame rate issues didn't help much at all...but either way, my interest in the game quickly faded after about...maybe half an hour into my first match. Sure, I love the fact that it's basically a zombie horde game but with dinosaurs, but...it was just far too repetitive to keep my interest for long. The dinosaurs were...in all honesty, they don't have great AI. Sure, they're good at surrounding you and tearing you to pieces; sure, they're good at charging you and running you through; sure, they're good at taking you out before you have time to react...but their attacks were far too predicatable and you could easily skirt them without receiveing any damage. The weapons were a bit...iffy, in my opinion. The pistols just sound like the automatic rifles, just in single bursts. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that some of the sound effects for two or three particular weapons are taken straight out of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2. I'll likely go on a tangent about that. But the rifles just felt...unbalanced to me. It was far too easy to get kills with them since they have next to no recoil from what I was able to see through my low frames. And the accuracy wasn't all that great, IMO. The last thing that really irked me was the fact that objectives were so damn far away from the bases. I mean, 500 meters is fine and dandy, but 1000 meters away from the main base? And you have to get there before dino's overrun the objective. What annoyed me was that you find out about the objective right at the start of a wave, so you have about 3-4 minutes of running to do in order to get to the objective while dino's are spawning already halfway to the objective and overruning it. You have no time to get to the objective before the raptors and ptera's are all over it. Granted, my frame rate issues were a large factor in me not enjoying my time playing the game. But I couldn't fix it for the life of me. But regardless, it was about fun for the first five minutes while I was fighting off raptors and compy's on my first wave. I mean, let's face it, anything with dinosaurs in it is going to be fun. I can overlook most of what I stated above simply because I can understand just how this game might be entertaining for the majority of players. But for me...there's no fun in repetition. For meticulous players like myself, I would not recommend this game However, if you're one to not be bothered by what I stated above, then this is a $0.99 game worth getting if you're simply looking for a fun time blowing the heads off of raptors. In that case, I would recommend this game to those players.

4405	0	a	theres like only 15 servers with no one in them. Honstly don't know how this game can still be this bad looking after 3 years of support. The trailer over hypes the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of this game. Not even worth $1.
4406	0	a	A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor game with laughably bad mechanics, a lot of bugs, guns that feel like a weak ejaculation and ugly looking graphics. Not even worth it if it were free.

4411	0	a	Dont understand why people are saying metacritic is wrong? The game is beyond broken, probably one of the worst games ive played. Rampage is the only game mode worth playing and thats just a flipping mess. The whole game is a mess, its in a sorry state and no update can fix this.  Its like the developers released a half â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ alpha and said it was the finished product.
4412	0	a	Paid for this game years ago, is now microtransaction piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
4413	0	a	bad copy of csgo and borderlands 2
4414	0	a	They changed the name of this game several times. The name changing is so out of hand that the review on the game's page is from the wrong game. It's constantly being discounted to 99 cents for a reason. Not very fun, and multiplayer is a real challenge to get working. Plus no one plays it. Still doesnt feel like a polished game for some reason.
4415	0	a	Played for 30 minutes and failed to find a reason to ever do it again. This could in theory be a really good game I imagine, it just doesn't quite work for a number of reasons. I didn't get any good explanation as to how anything works. The weapons and upgrades system is fairly basic and a little overwhelming at the same time for a newcomer, all the guns look and feel the same. The gfx/sfx are oddly bad in some places while decent in other places. Enemy models will often chaotically twitch for a moment, making it hard to aim where you want to, not to mention I saw every single raptor who got close to me from the inside because the camera was inside the model, something that shouldn't really happen.  Overall the game feels horribly unpolished and lacking any real substance. Then again it's dirt cheap and not downright terrible so I imagine it can offer some fun for good money if you find it more entertaining than I did.  P.S.: V as the default melee key and a second wind game mechanic that allows you to avoid death by getting a kill quickly enough... why does this feel familiar?
4416	0	a	How....How did they make a game about shooting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hoards of dinosaurs boring...How...HOW!?!??!?!?  This game sounded cool. 'You should play this game because it has guns and dinosaurs!' and what i got was...nothing...Emptyness. A shell.  This game is SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buggy, the AI are dumb as real dinosaurs and you might as well be handling a payload of nukes at the rate which dinosaurs die to your hand...OH GOD! HOW DID IT GET THIS BORING?!
4417	0	a	Wow they made the game worse. Gimme back my dollar!
4418	0	a	I really believe its a good game even as arcadish as it is now, but I just cant reccommend this to any of my friends. There are not decent servers with playable pings for me and my pals. Nowhere in my region are there any servers...I bought it simply because I found it cheap. Gameplay animations, etc could really use some polish...but for the low price I wont complaint much there.

4425	0	a	Game is a horrible mess, on top of that, Dev has had a past of stealing textures from other games, Don't be suprised if he changes the games name again to escape all the critisim,
4426	0	a	even for a 1$ is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing waste of money.
4427	0	a	This game feels like an alpha. Fun for the first 2 games of survival. No explanations of game mechanics (so you end up wasting a lot of ingame credits). Needs far more work to be a functional, complete game.
4428	0	a	LITERALLY the worst game I've EVER played.
4429	0	a	Game is nothing but rip offs and poorly coded boring gameplay
4430	0	a	y u put money on the game im mad &lt;:( 
4431	0	a	So much about this game is wrong... The first thing you notice is that you have no guns. Instead, you have a textured object in your hand, that supossedly does damage as the ammo counter in the bottom of your screen counts down. You have no way of knowing however, as not only is there no data on your enemy, but the gun does not move; there is no recoil, there is no muzzle flash, and there are no bullet decals. This just begins to describe the potentially fatal experience of Orion Dino Horde, including hills that you walk through, no explanation to the gameplay, overly large maps with no navigation, game ruining glitches, a dedicated fan base of 11 year olds, and T-Rexs that throw rocks from their mouths. You read that last bit right. The T-Rex throws rocks from their mouths.  However, with all of the faults the game has, it makes for a hilarious experience, especially with a friend by your side as you smash into dozens of dinosaurs in overpowered vehicles, trolling the serious players into rage quitting. Only buy it if you have a friend(s) to play it with. That is when it holds any value.

4434	0	a	Quite frankly, this game is awful. Simply put, it's bland, boring, and the videos make it look like a completely different game. I bought this while it was 99 cents, and you shouldn't.

4436	0	a	Gabe newell should pay us to play this piece of garbage
4437	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cancer. Don't buy it. All the maps are the same. The dinosaurs ice skate jet li quick style.
4438	0	a	The game uses stolen assets. Negative reviews are being swept under the carpet to keep the game from looking bad. They are currently suffering from a DMCA because of stolen assets, again. Just stay the fudge away from this game and don't ever support this developer or publisher, they have dishonest morals.
4439	0	a	I just got this game. I don't know wtf is going on but I can't connect to any servers. It either takes me back to the main menu or doesn't do anything at all. It won't even let me play solo mode. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.

4441	0	a	I don't know how this game is on steam. Constant crashing, disconnecting, bugs, etc. This isn't a finished product, not even close. Sound design is pretty bad, animations are mediocre, player and weapon models are kinda bad too. Dinosaurs are alright, but the environment is actually shockingly beautiful.  A bundle of bad/boring/broken mechanics, a generic grind game style, and no real reason to be grinding have this game coming in substantially worse than almost any other multiplayer free-to-play game, making it a bad purchase. Only played for about an hour, but most laughter and enjoyment came from just how absurdly bad some aspects of the game were.
4442	0	a	Hilariously bad coding, icons quite possibly stolen from Apple's iOS, and unintentional surrealism (read: bizarre ragdolling) combine to produce a quite mediocre dino-killer surprisingly reminiscent of Halo (with dinosaurs), but nowhere near as good.
4443	0	a	This game is a peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It was gifted to me..so thank you for the gift...but my god....no...nononononononononono
4444	0	a	all comments in trailer are lies. this game is not worth to 1 dollar... lets just end it there...
4445	0	a	99 cents for a game! Yes please!  Oh wait, no. This game sucks.
4446	0	a	Do not buy this game. No matter the discount, it is not worth the price. There's too much to go into, and I really don't care much. Just noticed that for some reason I had a positive review on here, and since it's on sale wanted to update the review to reflect the current game.
4447	0	a	It doesn't cooperate with my controller which is compatible for pc gaming. It is very irritating when holding down the shooting button nothing happens. There have been times in the game where I'd try moving forward and my character would just stand there. Not enough time to get a new weapon and when spawning my character would automatically die. If that were fixed then I'd totally recommend it.
4448	0	a	Literally Don't Buy This Horrible â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
4449	0	a	Terrible. I got it on sale, and it was the worst waste of a dollar ever.
4450	0	a	Meh, it's incomplete, glitchy, ugly, and repetitive- but it can be fun for a couple hours, i think it'd be worth a dollar if you have friends willing to play it with you- but otherwise , it'll be just another game to become untouched in your library after the first couple plays or so
4451	0	a	Prelude to what? Oh god, what am I playing?!
4452	0	a	Orion: Prelude (previously known as 'Orion: Dino Horde' and before that 'Orion: Dino Beatdown') exemplifies poor design with just about every detail, from the graphics to the gameplay. Visual effects (Motion blur, lens flares, water droplets) are overused to an extreme, actually making it very difficult to see what you're doing in some cases. It's as if the developers saw an effect they liked and put it in because it looked kind of cool, without any thought to how it meshed with the rest of the experience. This pattern holds true for the rest of the game: features are either half-baked (class system is totally useless) or just poorly done (sound design and animations are just awful).  Perhaps the only thing worse than this game is its the community: they really put the 'cult' into 'cult classic'. Look at any review online and the comments section will be littered with comments ranging from claims that 'the game is much better now and deserves a re-review' to outright accusing the reviewer of slandering the developers. It holds a 'mostly positive' ranking on steam simply because fans bombard the review board with meaningless positive recommendations (probably so they can appear in one of the games trailers).  The idea had potential, but there really isn't anything redeeming about what Trek Industries made with it. The only selling point is that it's so cheap, but I'd actually recommend not buying the game just on the principle of not supporting such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ product.
4453	0	a	I never asked for a 90's shooter.
4454	0	a	For some reason, this game crashed my brand new computer twice...  Aside from that, I almost feel that there's a few things in the game that would make a world of difference in the game. The biggest thing is the music, because the music almost ruins the moment (that's just me though). Also, the controls I wish would have been universal with all the vehicles, but maybe I didn't play long enough to check.
4455	0	a	... Where do I start? It was horrible short experience. The game doesn't grant you any information whatsoever. There is not even a tutorial to bring at least an introduction of what to do and what the controls etc are...
4456	0	a	It is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4457	0	a	I have a question for the developers, and I have some positive feedback. Question: Is this seriously all you managed to do with three YEARS of trying to improve it? Did you SERIOUSLY think any of these changes were improvements? Positive feedback: Great job with lowering the price. $0.99 is still a bit too much given the quality, but it's better than &gt;$20/
4458	0	a	A dull FPS with the elements of others and dinsosaurs instead of whatever generic game you want to compare it to.  The graphics aren't great and the framerate will drop randomly for no reason.  The gameplay itself is fine, there are no bugs and the controls are reactive. It's just you get to do the same thing over and over again, nothing really exciting.
4459	0	a	Absolute garbage optimization, so much that the game is unplayable. I would describe more, but i can't cause i cant play the game. You'll probably have more enjoyment out of bad rats then this piece of trash.
4460	0	a	This game is not ready to be released to the public.
4461	0	a	Huge rip off. I paid about 80 cents for the second time this was released (this is now it's third release and it's free 2 play now). Wish I could get those 80 cents back.
4462	0	a	Became free to play because it was not even worth 1 cent
4463	0	a	This game is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. dont waste a dollar on this thing. This game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that i almost choked to death on my own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hand

4468	0	a	its nice but the controls are very crazy wierd and the attacks of the dinos are not very well made when u attack it feels as if ur not even doing any damage to the enemy humans players can win easily needs moore very crucial updates will change review if changes are made correctly.

4470	0	a	After several attempts of playing this game, like for real. I didn't manage to shot a DAMN THING. I've spend over 20 minutes waiting , searching , sprinting... but I couldn't play it.  Why I couldn't play it? Because this game has tons of random crashes that random things causes them. Just no.
4471	0	a	It's just plain bad.,,, Don't buy it, not worth the 40 cents.
4472	0	a	I don't know why I didn't like this game. so...   - I feel boring when I playing this game  - I don't know why I write this review I only played this game like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' 0.2 hrs  yeah!! I'll rate this game 99/100 what?
4473	0	a	I purchased this when it was still called 'Orion: Dino Beatdown'. It looked very promising. It turned out to be the worst game I had intended to buy.   If any difference came in 'Prelude' then it should be celebrated because changing literally anything about Beatdown is a positive.
4474	0	a	Orion : Prelude is a step back from Orion Dino Horde. More lag, crappy gameplay made for controllers and a ingame cash shop ...... blargh!
4475	0	a	If you like broken games that uses about 100% of your GPU and still looks like crap then this is the game   for you.   It's like Goat Simulator, only that this game is unintentionally bad.

4477	0	a	No one plays it, the physics are uncontrollable and it's laggy, other than that good game. 3/10
4478	0	a	paid 99 cent... then it was free :(
4479	0	a	'Mostly Postive'  This statement is obviously manipulated. Yeah for a $1 sure, buy it.  ***There are TONS of reviews claiming the game is bad, but give a thumbs up anyway...hmmm***  Quite possibly the worst game ever created, or offered via Steam.  I am sure to be burned at the stake for this from the devs/marketers.  1. Horde Survival - Dinosaurs come at the players on a STRAIGHT PATH in groups riding choppy animations and an absolute lack of AI. 'B-Line to you and chomp.'  2. Art design is crap. Objects look painted like Supreme Commander up close, nothing seems to have a cohesive theme with any other items within game, everything LOOKS like someone plopped down objects in Garry's Mod and went 'Yep thats Half-Life 3.'  3. Terrible movement, maps are MASSIVE to the point of not fun. Games go on forever. Vehicles are cheap and clunky. It honestly looks like bad engine demo.  Can anyone tell me why it's trying to look like Halo?

4483	0	a	ThatÂ´s the first game I bought in the new steam interface....couldnÂ´t be sorrier. How come 73% of more than 10,000 user could possible recommend this crap!? One visit at metacr... site and all I see are terrible reviews by the critics and a very low metascore, but I had already bought it.  Difficult to play, need to put all video quality on low and still bugging. On other computer with more power the game was a little better but the gameplay is not ok, too messy and confused.

4499	0	a	I want my money back
4500	0	a	Since I was young, I have always had a raging passion for dinosaurs. My room was covered in dinosaur posters, and while my friends were playing with their action figures, I'd be cuddling with my Stegosaurus stuffed animal. Boy, those were the days. Now, back to my review of Orion: Prelude. Upon first glance on Steam, I was befuddled. My heart began to pound. A game for only 99 cents... and it has dinosaurs! Purchasing this game was nearly a no-brainer, the only problem I encountered was giving up 1/10 of my hourly wage from McDonalds to pay for a game. But hey, for some childhood nostalgia, it had to be worth it. I couldn't be more wrong. This game wanted me to kill the ones I loved. My enthusiasm for these creatures was one of endearment, and Orion: Prelude was telling me to hurt the animal I idolized. How could I agree? After completing a round of this mindless horde against cute little raptors and a righteous Tricerotops, I had enough. I immediately quit the game, and spent the rest of my Friday evening crying to myself about how the world is so morally evil, like most Friday nights... well most nights in general. But thats besides the point. This game attempted to ruin my zeal toward dinosaurs, and I couldn't take such a harsh hit to my life. I will be forced to use the Steam refund policy and spend my money somewhere else.

4509	0	a	Like surviving in a low-res dinosaur apocalypse, but without the fun.
4510	0	a	Poorly made game! wasn't worth. good thing I bought it when it was half off not full price!
4511	0	a	its not even like they genuinly tried, its just such a lazy game.
4512	0	a	This is one of those awkwardly medicore games. Even their options menu is clunky (with typos). With resolutions that are a bit off (especially if you show windowed). Hell, you can't even turn off things like head bob, so even your human bobs his head like he has a two foot neck (great for headaches). The combat has the awkward down with the dinos twitching around as they run half sideways as their attack.   Funny enough it even has a store to buy 'Spiral Coins' from, which is impressive for a non-F2P game. Though they seem to be putting a lot of updates in, so they probably are working for it.  I picked up a 4 pack on sale, just because even a bad game can be amusing on co-op. So I really wanted to like it, but it looks like I'll just keep those for gag gifts.
4513	0	a	I decided to play solo, and I've been killed by a raptor who was at least 5m away from me. Then I decided to run a little test on their AI = basically walking heat-seeking missiles with claws. -10/10 would not play again
4514	0	a	Terrible... Just terrible. The least they could do is make the in-game purchases menu look a bit better right?
4515	0	a	I paid 16 cents and I feel like I payed too much
4516	0	a	Screaming 'Team mate down!' is more fun than actually playing this game. It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in short. Dino chasing you? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cloak. Bam. You're invincible. There's nothing fun about it. The slow motion is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the dino ai is atrocious. I'm glad I only installed this for free week. There's also some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 'spooky christmas' map or some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. There's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ghosts and robo reindeers with lasers. Only buy it if you won't miss a dollar and have friends that have a sense of humour. Like no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke it's hilarious how bad this game is.

I like to think I have a fairly high tolerance for bugs and and patience when it comes to quirks, especially for indie games. However, not only is this 'game' amateurish, it is outright unplayable.  The only consolation is that I spent a mere $0.99 for it. Then again, in hindsight, if I had put a dollar towards a lottery ticket instead, I probably would have a higher chance of winning a jackpot than buying anything developed by ORION ever again. This is by far the most intolerably unpolished game I have ever had the misfortune of having on my computer.

This is 100% objective. The leveling system is bad. Collision detection is awful. Mapping is bad, but not as bad as i'd think from basically a glorified Source Engine mod. You know, games that are free. I bought this game when it was Â£0.01 and it's not even worth that.  0 stars.

4556	0	a	The first borderlands has better graphics. This game is a little fun when it works but, it doesn't work very often. This game is s**t, even for .53 $.
4557	0	a	Allthough I did not buy this (My freind gifted it to me) I highly regret installing this broken shell of a game. The port is terrible, even on ultra high graphics the game looks like crap, The team based mechanic is non existant and this is the 'Fixed' version of the game.  PROS: It is 99 cents. CONS: to many to count.
4558	0	a	This game sucks so f**king bad, like holy sh*t. Don't buy this if you have any right of mind.
4559	0	a	I cannot explain how terrible this game is. I have played this game for a total of 7 minutes and 45 seconds and honestly I hated every second that my eyes burned on these playstation 1 visuals. I have seen better looking videos and games on my iPod Nano. However I am told that the developers were ging through a tough time being blind. At least thats what I am hoping because this game is worse than that one time a small unloved child from a third world country choked on his own sadness. I wish I could refund my time and life wasted on this pittiful 17th century game that was funded by small children haters foundation. I am truely sorry if you bought this game, for you have been sucked in by the steam sales and the crappy games they put up for less than 5 dollars. FarmVile in my opinion would get my seconds of my life then this sorry excuse for a videogame.

4561	0	a	the shop is so bad and the overall of it is not fun and it is for like 5 secs and then it just gets so boring
4562	0	a	not even worth the dollar i paid for it
4563	0	a	Gun shoots are not really that real, need a long distance of running before jump into action, abit of boring game.
4564	0	a	A never ending party game
4565	0	a	This game kinda sucks. idk how else to put it. Very weak overall.   Repetitive and boring. With very low production value. honestly way better Horde mode co-op games to be played than this one.  Would not recommend
4566	0	a	Well what to say about this game...great premise. Execution is...well not so good. Tried it,but after 5minutes of playing i had no idea what was i doing, what should i do etc. Good game,but needs a lot of polishes. When its in sale and you have nothing to spend your money on, i say go buy this game just for lulz.
4567	0	a	This game is still HORRIBLE after three years of support. Please stop supporting it and let it die. If this is seriously 3 years of effort, you need to find a new career path.
4568	0	a	I spent 0.99 cents on this game. THIS IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK
4569	0	a	lame all around. bad graphics, bad game play, hardly have time to grab new weapons even. does not allow you to level up//no story line or campain mode.
4570	0	a	Look at the pretty screenshots.... This game blows.
4571	0	a	WORST GAME IN THE WORLD IT SUCKS DONT WASTE A DOLLAR ITS A STUPID GAME
4572	0	a	I just don't like the game, my personal opinion.
4573	0	a	I do like this game but not as good as everone said (i got it for $0.50) but its ok i guess....... 5.6/10
4574	0	a	Like masturbating with razor blades.
4575	0	a	My only gripe with this is that it's UNREALISTIC. Humans and dinosaurs weren't around at the same time. hell, T Rex and Stegosaurus didn't even live together. YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR FACTS BEFORE YOU RELEASE GAMES
4576	0	a	I lost R$ 2,19 buying this game
4577	0	a	as humorous as i thought it was playing for the first five minutes, this game did not sway me into buying into it. even with the sale price of 99 cents at the time of this review. is it entertaining? i'd like to think so? is it worth a dollar? debatable, at times it feels literally unfinished. wait, I take that back, pretty much all the time it feels unfinished. but I did enjoy the few minutes i played it but didn't see it go anywhere past 1 or 2 plays. if free gameplay and a 93% discount doesn't sway me into buying your game then i'm sorry i cannot reccomend buying this game. do play it at least once though. it'll be interesting.
4578	0	a	STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS!   Orion Dino Horde is nothing but a rebrand of the god awful Orion Dino Beatdown,however with more content and SOME bug fixes,the most notably one being the better optimization. BUT all of the issues are back full force:  -God Awful Dinosaur attack animations -Horrid Gunplay -TERRIBLE Sound Design -TERRIBLE firearm sound design -TERRIBLE Voice Acting -Sub-Par Graphics for a 2013 release,this looks like an early UE 3 game  there are other games that execute this ``Wave Survival`` mechanic much better than this travesty of a game,instead of buying this save up some cash and buy Killing Floor,this game was supposed to be a mod but SOMEHOW it got funded and now its asking for your hard earned cash,by the time im typing this review this game is on sale for 1 $,in my opinion its not even worth a dime throwing your money away is much more fun than buying this piece of crap.
4579	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, funny for half an hour but doesn't excuse it for sucking. Bought it out of curiosity, wasted my money.
4580	0	a	This game is worst game i ever played ! Lag , Hard to new players and it is not fun game !! Hate that game !!!
4581	0	a	Why did the name change and re-download. No. I got this because I thought it was funny. It runs poorly.
4582	0	a	This game is more shity than my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4583	0	a	I noticed a lot of other people said they were prompted with controller buttons on screen instead of keyboard when playing. I got the exact opposite. I had my controller plugged in and was prompted with keyboard options. So it sounds to me like this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥ backwards and i'm not surprised because it sucks. A lot. Don't waste your time.
4584	0	a	download this game  
4585	0	a	This game was a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when it first came out. They have came a very long way than what it use to be.  Give it a try but only think about how lame it is already.
4586	0	a	could have been improved

4588	0	a	Clunky and unattractive menu just generally something you'd make on scratch its just ehh 
4589	0	a	Just terrible.
4590	0	a	Its alright
4591	0	a	Every time I try to start the game it just crashes and i unintalled and reinstalled it and it still instantly crashes
4592	0	a	It's 1 dollar for a reason.
4593	0	a	The only game i wish i could delete from my library.
4594	0	a	What ever you do. Dont you ever buy this Game. It was the worst Game I ever bought and I even bought a 4 Pack because I though wow Dinosaurs must be fun. The Release Version was unplayable. I mean the dinosaur killsound was a Civilian HL2 Death sound. The Game was in such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ state that they released the Game again 1 year later under another name? HOW BAD CAN YOU BE THAT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME. The Original started a meer riot in the Steam forums for refund. So dont buy this. just dont!
4595	0	a	Don't believe their lies. It's a third-rate Unreal Tournament 3 mod, with tons of jank and like, one looping music track. It's worth 99c, but not a penny more.
4596	0	a	....... really.......
4597	0	a	bad fps treatment
4598	0	a	This game is the worst piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I have ver seen. The creators should literally take the computers they made this with and shove it up their asses. 10/10
4599	0	a	This game is advertised as an amazing reboot. To be honest, its rubbish. Its laggy for all the 4 people i know who have this game even though we all have very good computers, Its confusing to play and a waste of 79p !
4600	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It runs horribly and its a killing floor with dinosaurs. Its a one euro pound or whatewer its not waste of money but it doesnt last long. Buy killing floor instead or buy dino-d when its on steam sale.
4601	0	a	@InternetBeaver Why did you make me buy this?
4602	0	a	Terrible. 5 dollar budget. wasnt play tested. If there are more words to describe it, I dont think they exist.
4603	0	a	very poorly made game
4604	0	a	dont bother with it, its crap.
4605	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. The graphics are terrible and the best computer can't handle it weith the worst graphics on possible. And the game is just laggy and glitchy. This is the worst game to ever be in existense. The dinasours just like to fly around and attack you while you can't see because of the laggy peice of shot game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tits.
4606	0	a	It was really cool until i played it
4607	0	a	This game have good gameplay but you get bored preety fast and there are a few players.Don't recommand it.
4608	0	a	game doesn't start. 10/10 would play again
4609	0	a	bought this game as a joke after betting with my friend whether this game is worth a $ . played this game only for cards and later deleted this game . 10/10 would rate meh8/h8
4610	0	a	Horrible game. The guns feel horrible like they aren't doing anything. The devs say that they've improved the game, I would argue that they made it worse. The jetpack DOESNT work off the jump. The gun skins feel just thrown in.
4611	0	a	its a bit crap  more like oreo precumlube/10
4612	0	a	Back when this game was call Dino Beatdown the game have fewer dinos the graphics were 10x better and the gameplay was smoother. Now updates dino horde and prelude came changing the game into this bloody rubbish, and a major graphics downgrade to make the pretty ok looking game look like 32bit S*h*i*T and the only good thing to come out of it was the weather effects for the snow lvls  i used to love this game in 2012 but the updates ruined it
4613	0	a	Not working with Linux (Ubuntu) ?
4614	0	a	Its prettyyyyyy bad.
4615	0	a	awfull is a kind word
4616	0	a	Its an ok game but SEVERELY BROKEN did you have to dip down in quality after you almost got sued Step up guys seriously
4617	0	a	Terrible. I got this for almost nothing and I still want my money back.  For one thing, I can literally buy iron boots or w/e after one wave, jet pack up on top of rocks, and then become immortal because nothing can touch me, including the large Dinos like T-rex. The Pterodactyls can ram me, but they do so little damage its laughable  There is a day-night cycle, which makes the game basically unplayable because you need to kill all the dinosaurs in a wave to advance, including pterodactyls, which are completely invisible at night.  The big weapons like rocket launchers you cant even USE, or I havent figured out how without looking it up.  You can literally farm credits nonstop during non-wave missions, because unless you kill the large dinosaur, weenies spawn endlessly, and during non-wave segments you can buy power ups at any time. The first Non-wave mission I sat on a rock, untouchable, as pterodactyls rammed into me, shooting things with my peestol and making tons of cash, only going down to buy more ammo, then I bought almost every single power up and the highest power gun in every category.   The game itself is terribly optimized, and even though I can play skyrim decently, I cannot handle orion without disabling nearly every graphics option and even then, it's still like 20 fps. On the high settings, IF it ran right, it looks like something from the early naughties, not the 2010s. No reason at all to be so poorly optimized for pc.  2/110, good for some cheap laughs, but so much other stuff is much more fun.
4618	0	a	If you didn't think you could waste 50 cents, look no further.  
4619	0	a	What about people who play when it's not F2P ?? no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing refund for this ?? i feel disapointment so much :&lt;
4620	0	a	They make jokes that in 2012, they made the worst game ever, but now theyve turned it around.... NO.. The gaame is still pretty bland. i may have found this game interesting back in 2005, but here we are 10 years later and their gfx still look 10+ years old. the community seems pretty dead... there is barely a choice of server/game mode to choose from, i still cant get past the fact that this game looks like it would be ok back in 2000-2005. I wouldnt recommend playing this game unless its the very first game you play in history, that way you cant compare it to anything else.
4621	0	a	Welp now that it's free I feel stung by the developers. Real insult to anyone who bought this scum for money. Hopefully I shove my 99 cents so far up my â™¥â™¥â™¥ to simulate being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed by the developers.
4622	0	a	Trash. graphics are mediocre, performance is horrible, and dont even want to hear the audio, which sounds like a game from 1995, actually, worse. cons: poor quality, no singleplayer, bad multiplayer, overpriced dlcs, and not optimized.  pros: workshop.

4644	0	a	Sure am glad the specs keep changing
4645	0	a	All I can say is, thank goodness for the free week.   After about 10 minutes of playing, all I want to do is uninstall this crap. I honestly would have been â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ had I even wasted the measly $0.99 on this.
4646	0	a	  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. it's a waste of download space boring repetitive and servers are extremely laggy, if you shoot anything 1 ft in front of you it's gonna die 4 years later.

4670	0	a	its graphics are terrible and its gameplay sucks
4671	0	a	This game is full of glitches and problems and should be labelled early access with a disclaimer. When I shoot, I don't see bullets coming out of my gun and when I use a vehicle turret the screen just shakes, with nothing coming out of the gun. It somehow still does damage to the dinosaurs though. I would not recommend buying it, even at the price of $0.75 unless you just want to get the trading cards or something.  I was wondering how the game got a rating of 'Mostly Positive', but after looking at several other comments, I found out that this game has been removed and re-added to Steam several times due to terrible ratings, so I wouldn't expect long-term support for this game either.
4672	0	a	Before I begin, I would like to point out that I can run Far Cry 3 on high graphics.   This game could be great. It already would be great, if not for one killer - fps. On low everything, this game lags like hell, and my gun appears to be hovering in my hands, which often go through it. Also, there are no tutorials. I know you can probably find them online somewhere, but it would be nice if there was an optional one you could participate in if you needed to. I really tried to enjoy this game, but the fps, which was probably about 7, ruined my experience.   When they fix the fps problems and major lag, then, and only then, will this be a reccomendation.  It will be an awesome game when that happens. But for now, it is terrible.
4673	0	a	its not smooth, dinamycs are not very good, if you want to buy, buy it with a good discount.
4674	0	a	A total piece of crap to me. I hate the game play, but you can enjoy it. I would rate it 3.5 out of 10

4678	0	a	I have literally never played a worse game.
4679	0	a	It's alright for like 20 minutes at a time but gets boring pretty quick and it's hard to look past the gleaming flaws to actually enjoy it. Needs lots of work.   The price of a game is irrelevant, the fact that it's less than $1 doesn't excuse a broken game, too many lazy devs these days seem to think so though.
4680	0	a	the graffic's ar HORRIBLE AND TO MUCH LAG
4681	0	a	I don't even know why am I tried it.
4682	0	a	This game has so much potential, but it sucks so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bad. everything looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥, buggy, and controls like running through knee deep mud. 2/10
4683	0	a	This game is TaRASH i wouldn't recommend this game to my child if his life depended on my ex paying child support. This game is a -1/10 wouldn''t play it if my friend's life depended on it.
4684	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCMRpia6K_o  just watch that video, and YES this game is ORION: DINO HORDE NOT Prelude.... the only reason I own this game is because it was a gift from a friend over steam.I joined a game, IN THE LOBBY, and when the match started, I was prompted with wait for next round to respawn.Round timer: 45:00 minutes left, so I left.
4685	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible, even worse than Dino Horde
4686	0	a	Orion: Prelude caters to the zero demand in first/third person sci-fi dinosaur shooters, it's continued existence and updates is one of the great mysteries of life
4687	0	a	The third release of Orion: Dino Beatdown is no better than the first, they fixed some issues but a lot of technical stuff is still broken, and even for a dollar, a tenth of what i paid, I don't beleive thisis worth your time. There are better free games on steam.
4688	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but when they decided to make it look better, they just made the game more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, so now its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ covered in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 10/10 its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ `ign
4689	0	a	A poor quality game, poorly optomized, barely functional, and all around garbage. Everything that this game does, is stolen from other games, which do it a hundred times better. I mean this game isnt a -20 out of 10. but its like a 1 out of 10. its not even so bad its funny, its just dreadful. I got a four pack of this game for like 3 american dollars on sale, and I want my three dollars back. Id rather buy a soda or something.
4690	0	a	when i first played this game it was very laggy and the graphics are bad so i avoided this game for about a year and now im posting a review
4691	0	a	this is the worst game ever I paid for it and the grafics are bad most of the game is noobs the worst thing there is no planes or tanks 
4692	0	a	One of the worst games I've played in a while. Worth about $1. Maybe. Player has one life and that's it. When you die you lose ALL progress. Every weapon you purchased, every augmentation and you start over at the beginning of the game. That's honestly worse than the arcade games I used to play in the 80'S. At least with those I could put in another quarter to continue.
4693	0	a	This Game is Horrible
4694	0	a	you should just let this game be free because all your doing is anoying a lot of peoplee by putting out for only a week free and its not that good any way so just make free !!!!!!!!!!!!!
4695	0	a	4 Million copyies sold isn't a selling point for a $0.99 game.
4696	0	a	I tried to like this game... I really did, but it is sooooo boring. The first few minutes where like meh this game is ight. but in a few more boy my opinion would change. Just in the first 5 minutes it was so repetitive the dinosaurs aren't even that hard and multiplayer isn't that fun either... the game would be a great idea if they remade the graphics and added a story mode to it i wouldn't regret buying the game but sadly i do... 3/10 would kill raptors that don't even hurt me probably not again
4697	0	a	Server's dead. Bored now
4698	0	a	I remember playing this game on launch. Multiplayer was unplayable, singleplayer was barely playable. Since then it has come a long way, now I can call it a game without feeling too bad about myself. BUT saying it's a game now, doesn't mean it's good. Weapons sound like peashooters, graphics are washed out and ugly (this is what happens when untallented person gets hold on an Unreal 3 engine) and the general gameplay is not very entertaining. But it is much more stable now and you no longer see raptors spinning in place, so that's a step up.  There's just one more thing that needs to be mentioned: the game has changed it's title multiple times, it came from Orion: Dino Beatdown to Orion: Dino Horde to Orion: Prelude. Why is that? To escape the bad reviews it's gotten in the past? To trick people into thinking it's a different game?
4699	0	a	This game is so bad, it's like watching Louis Smith doing maths and english AT the SAME time.
4700	0	a	The worst game i ever bought! Bad graphics, not at all fun game mode, ugly looking character, not creative weapons and the boring dragons.
4701	0	a	The frame rate is so low, it is unbelievable, I had an incredibly low resolution setting on, and on an I5 Processor Windows 7 Ultimate hardware and it was unplayable, my friend has a fully working operating Windows 10 Computer, his was still laggy, DO NOT BUY, laggy to hell.
4702	0	a	Do NOT buy this game unless you have a very good gaming computer. I can normally run any game at 50-60 fps on good video settings. This game? Absolutely not. To get it to run at 60 fps, I have to make it look like it was made a looong time ago. At that point, all the intensity and excitement are pretty much gone, the tall grass blocks half your screen, and its pretty much just pointless to play. Worth the money but if you want a fps with dinosaurs, buy Dino D-Day.
4703	0	a	It's endless rounds of the same objectives over and over, there is no winning this game. You instead keep fighting hordes of dinosaurs until you die, then you can try to do better again I guess. It has ZERO plot, dinosaurs and unnamed futuristic Soldiers. This game must have taken the designers all of three minutes to come up with. I was hoping fr something like Turok and was very disappointed.
4704	0	a	its a crappy horrible game. 0/10 wouldnt install for anything.

4713	0	a	a dollar is practically worthless and i still feel like i wasted money on this simplistic, boring, barely-a-game.
4714	0	a	Very confusing for someone who rarely games, and even my brother who games a lot said it was very confusing. In at least the demo there were absolutely no instructions at all on how to play/what the controls are. I had to search a bit online for some help, even then I didn't figure out all the controls(I just started pressing random buttons to see what happened). Glad I didn't buy this game to be honest.
4715	0	a	This is absolute trash. Avoid.
4716	0	a	bought this game to play with my friends and was disappointed to discover that the game will not launch on my pc. instead i get a white screen and the task manager says its not responding. i hope this problem is fixed soon

4722	0	a	Orion: Prelude a game where you get to protect power generators and shoot dinos! Sounds fun right? Tried it out, guns sounded generic, abilities seemed a bit uninspired. Dino models looked great, gun models looked pretty decent, but the game crashed. Combine that effect with a lack of single player story and well... you get to shoot dinos right? Unfortunately the games not for me, you don't get to build anything permenanet, design any dinos, and from asking around all the matches, waves, and spawning rates are typically the same. I am not able to recommend this game.
4723	0	a	I dont realy like this game, the graphics..nah not that good.Best graphics since Atari 2600 :/ the gameplay, more like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ play.the idea of hunting dinosaurs in the future,what i thought they were dead.sorry 2/10 :/

4744	0	a	It was said to be a bad game, and it improved over the time. Better graphics and such. But i still think the graphics suck( I have it at max everthing for graphics) FPS sucks ( Turned everything to the minimum for this, and I have a very good pc) So, I belive in my perspective that this game still sucks.
4745	0	a	I fell for the trailer and the reviews. I thought it was a really good game. Then when I started playing it, I had the worst lagg (probably bc of the lack of servers) altough there where like, 20 people playing this game worldwide. I didnt know what to do, there was no information anywhere, and the graphics sucked, so no I dont recommend this game.
4746	0	a	Even free it's not worth it. Don't waste your time.
4747	0	a	no..... you still failed IT IS STILL A PRETTY BAD GAME Its not bad in graphic support but... THE DINOSAURS FTW????!!!! they glitch like s**t! and when the velociraptors stand still... the head is showing up 90Â° looks just like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ guy who saw an airplane for the first time but its not very bad... fix the glitches plz... then its 10/10
4748	0	a	DO NOT LISTEN TO THE LATEST PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN STATING THAT THIS IS A FIXED GAME. THIS IS POSSIBLY THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. IT TAKES AGES TO GET INTO A GAME AND WHEN YOU DO YOU MAY AS WELL BE TRYING TO STICK LEGO TO CAT TURD. AWFUL

4761	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

4765	0	a	I'm not going to rate Orion Prelude positively, as I found it to be lacking in different aspects such as soundtrack, regular updates, optimization, animation, ai, balance, etc. I will however say that you may as well give it a try with friends now that it is free

4771	0	a	I dont know what i bought it was 99 cents
4772	0	a	i really gave this game a try.. expecially due to the high amount of positive reviews. But in the end.. i couldnt get a single game to actually work.  Its lagging that much, that the game is simply unplayable. The maps are poorly designed. The AI is ultra stupid. There is in ingame shop. The game feels unfinished in pretty much every aspect (engine, AI, maps, HUD, controls etc etc). Nothing is actually 'smooth'.  IMO the game is not even worth the 1$ it costs right now.
4773	0	a	Horrible, I feel ripped off for 99 cents right now. Bad game.

I have a pritty good gaming PC and this game can only run on 20 FPS on high settings and it looks like a monkeys â™¥â™¥â™¥. It is falsely advertised as the screen shots look nothing like the game its self please just on one els buy this game it want even be worth it if they made it free!!!
4778	0	a	Don't get I already had it, but its making me pay because of the update. DONT GET IT ITS BS
4779	0	a	Hahaha, this is hilariously bad. I mean for a game it's lacking so much. It feels more like a mod that is still deep in beta. The ratings are pretty accurate here. I won't say that you'd be hurting too much getting this for $1.00 but I don't recommend getting this for it's full $15 price. It was atleast humurous to play but I don't think I'd be getting in it again anytime soon.   Revelations 2012/ Bioshock infinite
4780	0	a	This game is worth the 99 cents I paid for it. The graphics are alright not great but not crappy either but the gameplay is really laggy, slow and feels overall not good. The game really isn't even that fun you just walk around and shoot at things that run at you and its not even hard. Overall I would not reccomend this game I only bought it because it was 99 cents.
4781	0	a	Orion: Dino Beatdown is an entirely broken FPS.
4782	0	a	I bought this game on a whim. That and it was 1 dollar. I managed to play enough to fulfill that 1 dollar but at face value it would not be worth it.  Why? For a game that is supposed to gone from a 3 to an 8 it feels like there are still numerous issues that have yet to be dealt with. For one, the issue with trying to join in a server and it doesn't work. There are times when joining a server crashes the game altogether.  Gameplay-wise I find that being eaten by a large dinosaur is a bit redundant due to the fact that you have a gun. Seriously, get eaten, blow the dinosaur's insides out with bullets or go kamikazi with a grenade and BAM! dead dinosaur. But the game says that's impossible.  Music is okay, can't complain about that.  Announcer voice seems to be a bit funky here and there when trying to announce things but otherwise not worth adding or removing points.  Overall, it's an okay game if you buy it bargain-bin(Around $0.99) but as a full game there are better games out there. 7/10.
4783	0	a	Not bad but the animations are a 'bit' weird and not worth 11 â‚¬,i would take primal carnage and dino d day any day of the week..
4784	0	a	Worst game i've ever bought
4785	0	a	Not even worth 99 cence, this game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pile of dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ topped with asscheeks
4786	0	a	This Is The Worst Co-Op Game I've Ever Played.
4787	0	a	No manual, no tutorial. Even a mouse-like dinosuar could take you down, (before you find it).
4788	0	a	This is an unfinished game. The animations for characters, player view models, and dinosaurs are lazily done. For instance, the pistol equip animation doesn't sync with the pistol itself; the pistol will be in idle position a good half-second before the hands are fully out there. The gameplay is shallow, since it's basically 'kill dinosaurs with no real impact with their attacks' then 'buy one upgrade' and rinse, repeat.
4789	0	a	Don't be fooled by the trailers. This game is surrounded in controversy, mainly due to it's main developer David Prassel. Among a long list of nefarious acts, Prassel has been accused of stealing elements from other games, laying off employees without paying them for work, and manipulating message boards to deflect negative criticism towards the game. In addition Prassel tried to rebrand the game formerly known as 'Dino Beatdown' into 'Dino Horde' to increase Metacritic scores; claiming it to be a sequel when it's more of a content update. Even if one were to ignore the game's depraved upbringing, the game with it's comically short T-Rex arms fails to grasp the lofty claims and over-hype created presumably by Prassel.  Ignoring the game's heavy influence from Halo, the gameplay revolves around a stereotypical group of 'space marines' defending bases against swarms of prehistoric predators, which in of itself sounds okay on paper. However, within the first hour of playing, any seasoned gamer with a critical bone in their body will start to see the game's inherent flaws emerge. The game which marketed itself around commiting mass dino-cide features a surprisingly laughable AI that would make a Stegosaurus roll in it's sedimentary grave. The dinos tend to path in a completely linear fashion towards the player which makes 'Dino Horde' feel more like 'Dino Queue' which really brings the atmosphere in the game to extinction. Taking high ground will often result in dinosaurs running around in erradic beelines as you frantically spray at them with shoddy hit registration until they die. Don't worry about the hit registration though, because all of the basic ground dinosaurs can be run down inside of invincible ground vehicles such as the Wartho- I mean 'Gladiator' combat buggy, making firearms completely pointless outside of killing large dinosaurs. No seriously, I ground dinos into lizard burger for an hour and was awarded top score for being the most unskilled player on my team before I logged off in bitter apathy.  I tried giving this game a fair chance, I really did. I tried looking past Prassel coddling his 'baby' like an overprotective parent, his apparently questionable business practice and his deplorable attempt at dodging Metacritic rating, Underneath it all though was only the husk of a game, a grand idea with poor execution, and unfortunately it will not keep the interest of experienced gamers. Don't get me wrong, this game can be a fun waste of time with friends, but you should be laughing WITH the game, not AT it. Until someone can nail the 'dino defense' game on the head, my dream will remain fossilized in amber until it's DNA can be extracted and brought back to life, which sadly will most likely not be anytime soon.
4790	0	a	So i recently come upon this game think 'Holy crap im going to be able to like rpe some fckin dinosaurs. So I had to make a choice to rather get food for my family, or play as motherfckin dinosaurs and let my family play a couple times. So I decided to buy Orion Dino Horde. At first I was like, holy fricken jesus look at the small dinosaurs that just horde the generator, screw orion dino horde, it should be dinosaurs like to orion the generator with a horde. While I play, I let my friend Anne Frank play for a while, she said 'lulz i gve it 0/7, bt il be bck, im goin to gt baked' so i assumed she ment going to the sauna because that game was amazingly optimized but instead she climbed in the oven and left me a note saying 'lulz, il nver be an mlg orion dino horde player lik u'. I said aw, you really think im that good? Of course she didn't respond because the game was sooo good it made her kill herself. So then I thought, if im really that good, ill need other people to tell me that. So I got a buddy of mine named Lorenzo who was healthy and young. After he was done he said 'lulz hld on polp, i ned to seee mi parnts bcuse lulz' I was so confused so I waited and a week later I go to his house and hes all 'U DID DIS TOO ME' and I ran and talked to Lorenzos dad and he said, 'lulz dat fagot got ALD from somedinhg clled Dino Beatdown'. I got really scared and left. 2 years later i go back to his house and he is now hooked to a respirator and a suculant incubator. Thats when I realized something, that game gave him ALD. So I let him play it one more time for good old times and he said '.-.. ..- .-.. --.. / ..-. .- --. --- - / ---.. -..-. ---..' thats in morse code, so that means 'lulz fagot 8/8'. I really couldn't believe how Mlg I was at this game. But then that made me think, one person who played this game killed herself, and the other onee got ALD from it and only enjoyed it when he was paralyzed, blind, deaf, and could only move his hands. So finally, my review on this game is that you rather have to be MLG like me John Motherphockin Sorcerer Polp, or you die and get ALD from it. It was worth buying this game then giving my family food. Lulz i give this game 1/8, would not get noscoped by dinosaurs again.

4801	0	a	I bought this game on my laptop and it ran fine on the lowest settings and now I have a pc, And putting the game on low to med settings it will still lag, I dont understand this, on my laptop I have a gefirce 610m 2GB and on my pc I have a GTX 750ti which is far supirior, I would like to recomend this game but it runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, well the way it is optimized.] Apart from the graphics the gameplay is alot of fun, no servers but solo is alot of fun with bots. I can tell it is sort of like halo and dinosausrs together.  The controller mapping works great, not sure about keyboard. (didnt try) Overall I would not recomend as it runs very porly so unless this is fixed I cant recomend.
4802	0	a	Is there any way I can refund this game? It's WAY too laggy
4803	0	a	I bought the game for my 'team' ( 3 very close people), and we heavy relly on coop, but this was like a time-travel; this is was a a great game, for a game dated about 20 years ago.  I know, it cost like a bus ticket, but it was an awfull hipster trip.
4804	0	a	I'm sorry.   I know it's only a buck.   But it is not very enjoyable.   Especially when there are free games that are more fun. Seriously.   I gave it a shot.   Cost me a buck.   But I don't think this was worth the download.   Sorry.
4805	0	a	I could have spent the one euro on a coke or something. I knew this was bad, but this game puts the word bad in a new dimension of bad. Like shaving your beard with a kitchenknife kinda bad. This game hurts right in my feels. But I was stupid enough to even buy it to begin with.
4806	0	a	I didn't want to buy this game...  ...but hey it was 99 cents!

4811	0	a	Don't be misled by the other reviews, this game is an unfinished piece of garbage. This 'game' is exactly the same as Dino Beatdown, and makes no attempt to hide it, as it still goes under the same name in the game files. The game itself looks absolutely nothing like a 2012 release, with shoddy textures, extremely low-polycount models and very natural selection type gameplay. As if it couldn't get any worse, the game also features a cosmetics shop, stocked with low-effort reskins and glaringly bright armour colours.  Overall verdict: This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If you want giant monsters, strategy and sci-fi themes, go play Natural Selection 2. I'm glad I saved myself 99p by playing it free.
4812	0	a	Its pretty terrible. Not even worth .99 cents.
4813	0	a	6/10 I'll play it only when friends are playing and I'm glad I only paid 99 cents. Really weird collision detection, hitboxes, dinos can do a zero G turn like a snapper lawn mower, game crashed on my first launch, and I've encountered several bugs during my first few hours. One bug being people were freely able to join into my 'Friends Only' game. Still fun to play with friends.
4814	0	a	It is pretty funny, I'll give it that.
4815	0	a	This game is terrible, luckily it is the type of terrible that you can laugh at, do not buy in uless it goes under 2 bucks
4816	0	a	I've got it 2012 for 10â‚¬... Yeah, I'd like a hug right now. :'(  Oh? My hours played? Yea. my steam bugged all the day, and back in 2012 the game didn't wanted to be closed. I mean, steam thought the game was open and counted the hours.  If you ever wanted to buy this game, do not. Spend that 1,00 for whatever you like. Some candys whatever. Get something food or water for it, idc, BUT, do something usefull with it.  You can thank me later. Cya
4817	0	a	Not worth a dollar Gameplay is boring Guns don't recoil properly all around a pretty lame game
4818	0	a	{This is for mac players} Its fun i tried it but it aint mac supported....
4819	0	a	A good try at a game but it falls short in most areas. The combat is iffy and the controls feel weird. The concepts are all there but it is just missing something. It has many multiplayer aspects which can be fun but all fall short of amazing.  Personal Rating: 4/10
4820	0	a	This game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The sounds, AI, and overall the total game is really bad. The AI just runs in circles, along the main route, or just straight at you until it kills you.  I've asked so many times for a refund, and been ignored every time. When I bought this, I noticed that none of my friends have played longer than ~1 hour. Now I see why.  Please, just don't buy it. It's really awful.

4824	0	a	What a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for the third time.
4825	0	a	Did not really dig this game as much as I thought I would. Did not play well, bad clips all over and not very visually pleasing either.
4826	0	a	No dont get this game this is a wast of time and money this game will not let you play it and worst game ever in history and never should have been invented in the first place screw this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4827	0	a	Quite stupid. It could have had much more variety.
4828	0	a	runs badly on windows 7 (i got windows 8 still laggy)
4829	0	a	Intersting concept, but not very polished.
4830	0	a	its super slow to connect to servers, even EA's servers are way better tha this game's servers. (i have good internet)
4831	0	a	Really bad attempt to make a decent 'horde' mode game which is all this game has to offer with graphics from the 90's.
4832	0	a	Buggs And Bad Graphics !
4833	0	a	garbage game, not worth 99cents
4834	0	a	it is so bad i can even think anymore
4835	0	a	the trailer made this game look like it was going to be a spinoff of ARK: Survival Evolved... but it turned out to be an arena game. At least it was only 50 cents! 
4836	0	a	I played it for 30 minutes it was okay glitchy but okay, later I turned the game off and now as soon as I start the game it won't boot it just stays running and now I can't get my refund :)
4837	0	a	
4838	0	a	boring game don't buy.......... :P
4839	0	a	What am I even doing here?
4840	0	a	is a bs game was tricked into buying the game. it was on sale for a dollar when the main price was 15.99 so i was like cool what a deal bought the four pack and the next day it was 1.99 all the time, would never have bought this game if it would have been a dollar all the time was looking forward it being 15.99 so i could trade it on cs lounge or use it to my advantagfe at a later date but the game bombed and was a scam as soon as it was put to 1.99.
4841	0	a	i cant open lobby why help pleas 
4842	0	a	Yeah 0,99â‚¬ Is still to much for this shity game!
4843	0	a	To be honest this game is good when it is known as ORION: DINO ( open beta ) but now after its open beta , the graphics of the game is totally like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and lag much more worst if you are connecting to europe server
4844	0	a	LAG.......GY......A......S......HE.......CK.....
4845	0	a	1. Pull up options, cuz my computer's a potato. 2. Disable a majority of video settings 3. Set quality to low. 4. Try to play. 5. All I see is white 6. Reset settings. 7. Click Save 8. Crashed.  1.69/10
4846	0	a	uhhh. dafuq is this halo/cod zombie remake?
4847	0	a	Yellow its me    So pretty much this game is so bad its good. I had wanted to purchase it before when it wasnt f2p but when it came out i was psyched. I played this for 40 mins and had to stop because it couldnt connect to server. Its addicting in a weird type of way. Its pretty good besides the fact that it lags when i have an i7 and nvidia gtx 960 so yeah...        bai      r8 5/8
4848	0	a	Audio clips for the guns and everything sound terrible or sound like they've been ripped from another game, graphics look like dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Glad I didnt pay 99 cents because it wasnt worth it. 0.1/10
4849	0	a	Give me my euro back!
4850	0	a	TL;DR: Fun for the first hour or two, but was controversial, and is unoptimized, even after more than 3 years of development.  So this game has been the subject of plenty of controversy for over 3 years. Released multiple times with different names such as Orion: Dino Beatdown and Orion: Dino Horde. Then it was also part of another controversy as far as theft of assets. But let's get off that and into the actual game.  You basically survive wave after wave of killing dinosaurs, while completing the occasional objective or two as the match goes on. You can do this on your own, but it's usually more fun to play with people. It's rather fun, if you like having no challenge, as dinosaurs can easily be unable to get to spots on many of the maps, making it easy to exploit them. This is because of how easy it is to get to some places with the Assault's jetpack, but even then, you wouldn't have too many issues with the normal dinos if you were another class, due to how horrid the AI is. The flying dinosaurs are hardly any issue either, as they don't take too much to kill. This effectively drives any fun in the game extinct unless you like potshotting giant reptiles.  I had some fun with this game, worth the 1 dollar I spent on it, but to be quite honest, I have no faith in the devs at this point, and I doubt this game is going to become much better at all, as much of an unoptimized mess that it is.  But hey, now you can kill derp dinos for free.  You'll get some fun out of it, but don't expect too much more than what you get in perhaps the first hour or two of playing.
4851	0	a	i purchased this on my windows pc that meets the recommendated software and stuff but then when i go in the audio is all f'ed up and i get 1.5 frames per second and you said you fixed it if its not fixed in 1 week (a week because i dont think you did bug fixes in a while and i want a refund if its not working) ill get a refund
4852	0	a	Oh wow, this is free now?  The optimization is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and motion blur is only noticable on dinos, not the camera.
4853	0	a	I hate it
4854	0	a	ripped my money
4855	0	a	The frame rate was horible, but its probably just my computer. I dident see an Open World gamemode only a Humans VS Dinos mode but i only played for 3 minuits because it was too laggy for me. the game looks really cool (the open world part) but i cant play it on this computer so i returned it.
4856	0	a	Cancer.
4857	0	a	Interesting concept, trying to be a 'survive the wave' type game, I guess like a cross between Halo, Left 4 Dead, with dinosaurs. You can level up your characters to give them better skills, and drive around in various vehicles and buy new weapons to help kill the dinosaurs.   Very dated graphically, but even worse is it's not particularly interesting/barely existant gameplay, AI on the dinosaurs is a bit rubbish, they just run straight at you. Nowhere near as entertaining as the teaser trailer seems to imply. The level ups aren't particularly interesting, and the game maps are poorly designed.   Sure it's only a dollar, but there are a number of Free to Play FPS titles that are more entertaining and a better use of your time. I can only guess that all the positive reviews are trolling.
4858	0	a	this game is as bad as me being alive.
4859	0	a	  Is this game 0,99 cents? This game should have been free, or even better you should be paid 0,99 cents for each minute you play in this mind numbing game. I played for 50 minutes and i feel like throwing up. The driving is awful and the weapons seem to go right through your hand. The only positive aspect of this game is that it made me rethink my life choices. I rate it a solid 2/10.
4860	0	a	very boring dont buy it
4861	0	a	One playthrough of 4 minutes and I've already been annoyed by buggy â™¥â™¥â™¥ bots, buggy â™¥â™¥â™¥ enemys and poor excuses for maps. I can handle the severely outdated graphics from a half life 1 engine but god damn this isn't fun.   Halloween Map titled 'Hell' is poorly recycled, with ear â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sound effects and music in the startingbase. The map consisted of poorly reused flaming pumpkins littered everywhere. The only game changing feature being a incredibly unfair and seriously stupid looking pumpkin boss. This boss however made the game really frustrated by downing our poorly organised squad in the matter of seconds. Reminder that this all happened barely 4 minutes into our experience of the game and im already sick of this game.  Bad game 3/10
4862	0	a	This game seemed good, but the graphics suck and it doesn't tell you how to do anything, such as buying new weapons. Also, the dinos horde around you after like 2 rounds and its pretty much impossible to escape that. DO NOT waste you 49 cents on this trash.
4863	0	a	played again after a year break. game is still empty of players.
4864	0	a	I paid 1$ for this game. Actual money.  Its being updated pretty frequently but in its current state, I should have bought some ice cream instead.
4865	0	a	Sure the game is less that a $1. But it's real bad. About an hour of gameplay before you'll get bored of it. I guess you get what you pay for.
4866	0	a	I'd like to say I recommend the game because I used to love it. But it won't launch for me, this is an issue I also have with Smite so I think it's my graphics card, for the 2 it says it launched as 32bit dx9. That's all I know about the issue. I'd love if this could get fixed because it's a really fun game but I can't actually play it! Edit - Game works on new computer, still a bit boring, gameplay is limited.
4867	0	a	Worst game ever, but is still alright 
4868	0	a	This is literally the worst game I have ever played. Not even worth the download time for its free weekend.
4869	0	a	This game has poor gunplay ,the dinosaurs take almost random amounts of damage, the characters dont start with anything more then a pistol and you have to buy all other guns,When you die you go into a second wind style mode which would be good save for the fact that when you go into this mode ALL OF THE DINOSAURS RUN AWAY FROM YOU makeing it nearly imposable to respawn unless its the start of a new wave. If you wanted m to play a horde shooter i recomend killing floor or if you want a game where you can kill dinosaur-like creatures borderlands 2 also has better gunplay
4870	0	a	Ai is awful, the dinosaurs get stuck on walls. the graphics are on par with an xbox game (no, not a 360, before that) circa red faction 2 era. for all its supposed to tout, the videos make the game look 10 times better. save your dollar. this simply is NOT worth it. even if they give it away for free, still not worth it. so many other interesting games you could play, even free ones. this game is flat, boring and brings NOTHING new to an FPS genre. this game will make you think of what a freshman high school student would show as a computer science project. if you think i feel hurt, i am. i didnt even buy this crap. my friend gave it to me and asked me to play with him. so we did. controls are clunky, and every gun and aspect of this game is nothing but regurgitated crap you have already played many times. this should have just been an extra piece of content in a real game. sort of like how they added 'Zombies' to Call of Duty. dont get me wrong though, CoD sucks too.
4871	0	a	Worst game ever it's a wasting of money. Don't buy it.
4872	0	a	it mite be my pc but the gaem is 2 laggy
4873	0	a	This game has some cool features but I don't think they executed their plans good enough for it to be a good game. Gunplay is terrible on this game, dinosaurs are poorly textured if you ask me. It's always the same, you can go on for ages. A little bit too easy. After all I wouldn't recommend this game, this is also the reason why it became so cheap in the first place. NO.
4874	0	a	I wanted it to be good, but it's clunky, awful looking, cheaply made and not very fun.
4875	0	a	black screen at launch:(
4876	0	a	0/10
4877	0	a	I haven't played this a lot yet, but so far the experience has been quite terrible. When I play with others the game seem to randomly lag like crazy. Also, monster animations are a travesty. Completely boring combat. I think it's safe to skip this one.  2014.10.02: I've noticed the game has changed its name yet again. It's at least the third time it has changed name. Pathetic.
4878	0	a	I tried it, I didn't like it. It has... it's... ... I DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT IT WAS NOT BAD. Just not my cup of tea. Maybe it just didn't make sense to me... or not creative at all? Whatever it is... I'll pass.
4879	0	a	For 99p this game is well... it's 99p so it's not a waste of money.  But for anything more then Â£2.99 let alone it's original Â£11.99 price tag.  --Cons -Bad graphics -Terrible game machinics -SUPER repetitive -Simply the fact that it's normal price is Â£11.99 is stupid in all -SUPER loud sounds for no reason -Nothing is explained and nothing seems to works correctly -No good sounds for guns or hit markers sounds -Not satisfying in anyway to actually shoot the dino's -Terrible model detail -Lacks FOV slider from what i could see -Buggy (Terrible dino clipping and pretty unbalanced and random)  -Pro's It really was only 99p on SALE. It had good game option
4880	0	a	Played A while Back When It had a free weekend deal thing ( Before this F2P version) It was Okay Then. Now it is bad. I think people who paid for the first game should get a refund. (not including me)
4881	0	a	Why would you buy this? It's awful..  No really it's awful..  GFX are in line with PS2.. This is like one of those bad movies that's so bad it's good, cept nothing is good. Save your $ and buy something else.
4882	0	a	i got this confused with primal carnage... this is not primal carnage.
4883	0	a	this game always crashes
4884	0	a	Biggest pile of.....  Yeah its a cheap game, but ive played played much better free to play games than this trollip. 6 attempts to try and connect to a game, when i finally did game was laggy as anything, internet connection is fine, and running a gtx960 which is more than enough to play this game.  Dont waste your money on this, only worth it for the 6 free badge cards, which if you sell will pay for the game itself.
4885	0	a	Its free now...thats how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it is
4886	0	a	Bought this game as a four-pack for some of my friends with amazing computers. NO ONE CAN RUN IT!
4887	0	a	This game, although cheap, is not worth 79p.
4888	0	a	I don't write reviews. But when I do, it's cuz the game sucked.
4889	0	a	As decent as this game is, it continues to randomly decide that I don't own it, and tells me to re-purchase it. It is in no way worth it's full price, but if you can snatch it for a buck, then you'd might as well.
4890	0	a	its ok, crashs more than I would like and a lot of server drops.
4891	0	a	Boring Buggy Mess
4892	0	a	no server for sea, play at 200 ping
4893	0	a	I cant really play this game right now, until i get an better connection and see why this game is loved much, im not recommending it, personally i found it an bit confusing.
4894	0	a	played this and immediately hated myself for even buying it. 10/10 whould buy again.
4895	0	a	this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks. The first thing you see in the game is the main menu. Everything normal right? Well it isn't. As soon as I launched it and saw the main menu I witnessed my graphics card's temperature ramp up from 40Âº to 75ÂºCelsius. I changed my graphics settings to the minimum possible and I saw no difference. My framerate was still locked to 60 and my GPU was still running hot.  That's just one issue: Optimization. Let's get to the next part: Gameplay I haven't tested any gamemodes other than survival so I can't really vote on this one but I got bored almost immediately, using every class and playing in different ways. The weapon system is lacking and sure needs work.  Just don't buy this. Even for 70 cents it's not playable. Don't kill your gpu for a 70cents game.
4896	0	a	Your bullets teleport to the target, this game sucks.
4897	0	a	I played 16 minutes of this game and i hated it. The game is very slow and laggy and yet I feel like even though that it is free, I still feel like I want a refund for wasting those 16 minutes of my life. 0/10 would never play again.
4898	0	a	I thinkt the fact that the creator had to use Imovie to make the trailer says alot about this games budget
4899	0	a	This is how you steal assets from another game and claim that assets as yours.  Good way to reduce production money and time.
4900	0	a	I couldn't get the game to work. My beast machine couldn't handle Orion Dino horde.
4901	0	a	should be a free game
4902	0	a	Definately no similarity to the Carnivores series of dino hunting games. Might be fun with friends, but when playing solo, it's nearly impossible to survive more than a few waves of dinosaurs. I hope developers create something similar to the old Carnivores games...this definately isn't even close to a real dino hunting game.
4903	0	a	The server connections and server browser are horrible.
4904	0	a	UPDATE: Spiral changed name, and the game changed name- it is now orion:prelude- and it does not change anything that is written in this review- so make your own conclusions on how bad this game that is now on its third name is.  Bad. Do not buy.  Killing Floor is a hordemode shooter that focuses on one thing and does it damn well- only objective is to shoot well-designed enemies with well-designed weapons, and the sounds, music and feel are all tehre to make that fun. Weapons are powerful and feel powerful yet balanced between eachother, enemies are dangerous yet 'fair' and react to shots.  ORION DINO HORDE however, does the exact opposite: it give a player tons of guns and vehicles and makes all of them very bland. it gives billion game modes out of which 1 or 2 are worth playing and rest are dinosaur carp. Enemies feel plastic, hitboxes are wonky and movement is hideous. all animations are f-grade be it enemy, friendly or vehicle. The entire sound design is hideous: the loudest weapon in game are dual pistols, which deafen out tank gun and dual gatlings 100 to 1. weapons are laughably underpowered and imbalanced, only this enemies do is rush you like kamikaze planes.  Most of the flaws in the game are obvious to anyone who stops to sit for 5 seconds on 'what should good gameplay include', but Spiral is content on pumping out 'more is better' without a single thought on quality of the game.
4905	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4906	0	a	I regret spending 74 cents on this game that is developed by amateurs. Don't be fooled by their game trailers. Why do you think this game costs 74 cents?
4907	0	a	It's broken. Maybe a good laugh with your friends, but not really worth picking up, even for a dollar.
4908	0	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a fun game even solo I enjoyed the gameplay and the wave after wave of dinosaurs heading toward me with killer intent BUT then it started crashing. After about 2 hours or so after playing I took a break and started up my steam account and launched the game only too have it freeze on me every 5 or so minutes. One of my friend's computer started doing the same thing later on. My computer can run most games on their highest settings but even turning down the graphic to a lower setting did not help. The developers need too fix these bugs if so they'll have a enjoyable multiplayer game on there hands
4909	0	a	it doesn't seem to be running properly. i'm not sure if that's because of my system or an internet related problem, but its too frustrating to hold my attention.
4910	0	a	Barely playable.
4911	0	a	this game is very annoying everytime i try to play theres a computer type person who circles me the entire time i try to play. very annoying!!!
4912	0	a	a junk game, a dumbed down version of halo with much less
4913	0	a	This game is the embodiment of an awkward child you don't want to sit next to at lunch.
4914	0	a	Just, not finished game...
4915	0	a	pretty bad, glad I spent $1 on it.  The problems are the map is too big for walking and too small for the slow vehicles. Combat is boring, AIs are boring, graphics are too simplistic.
4916	0	a	This game is unplayable. I streamed this @  www.twitch.tv/sirspoony  and frapsed it for first impressions youtube.   I was unable to create a solo game.  I was unable to join any online games because they were all locked.  I was unable to play with friends and viewers because none of us could team up for games.  Games would just not launch.  This game is not even worth the $0.99 because it did not work for me or the many people trying it out in my stream as well. So guessing it's either broken or so unstable server-wise that it makes it unplayable.  On a side note. They trolled gamers everwhere and won. They actually fooled the many idiots into thinking this is a recommendable game? Sorry for your obvious loss of some humanity based on trickery.
4917	0	a	I hate this game cuz every time I die I lose all my money that I've saved for weapons and have to start over again :(
4918	0	a	This game is awfully buggy and quite crappy. I guess one could like it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way but honestly it isn't worth it. Good for one fun night with friends but after that you'll never go back
4919	0	a	This game is so broken it hurts.The dinosaurs glitch around,the animation is garbage,the game runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on my high-end PC on the lowest setting,and the fps keeps dropping and increasing every five seconds.Really don't buy it.Buy ORION instead.It's better in every way
4920	0	a	I expected a lot after watching the trailer for this game, but they still havenÂ´t fixed a LOT of bugs, they shouldÂ´ve started development of this game from the bottom. There is missing full controller support and itÂ´s just not as good as I thought it would be.  4,5/10

4922	0	a	It has potential but its not fully realized the game's menus are absolutely horriffic and the chat menu is annoying as hell in game. It seems like a cool idea shooting dinosaurs but needs more polish. ALOT more polish.
4923	0	a	Don't trust their newest propaganda people! This game still sucks! 1/10 Don't buy this. Please.
4924	0	a	Very very bad game...
4925	0	a	Not only has this game changed its name 3 TIMES. But its hasnt changed anything in the game itself, infact with the new 'and improved'''''' Prelude update, NOTHING is different from what have i found. I paid 15 dollors for this. Now its less then one..... Lie honestly. i dont have many hours in this game because it honestly sucks, like seriously. It looks like it was made on the unity engine, The gameplay is terrible, and the new 'horde Bots' that theyve added are reeally just random characters FULLY decked out with all the pay to win gear, plus, they dont even get attacked barely, It would be as if the dinos dont see them and come straight torwards the player. The screenshots are nothing like the game itself, it shows itself as a fun and enjoyable game to play with friends. WHen in reality it goes as follows ' Hey dude you get Orion?' ' No it looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' ' so what play it with me, il even buy it for you' I buy it for a bud, we play and after 20 minutes we give up, because its just that bad of a game. Multiplayers a drag, the guns are basic. The guns look all futuristic and that they shoot lazers..... No.... Its just bullets. No lazers or any of the sorts. The stuff that you buy in game affect the game in absolutely no way possible, There just ' Hey look at me i look cool i spent 5 bucks in game, Wait no one plays this game.' ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE IN PURCHASE ITEMS, AND THE LOWEST PRICED ITEM IS MORE THEN THE ACTUAL GAME ITSELF. IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING. RIDICULOUS. Dont buy the damn game, after this review I uninstalling as i just spent 10 minutes in the game. NOTHING IS CHANGED. just the name, for the third time. The meta score is right, it sucks. Even the loading images are the exact same. the class pictures are the exact same. the dinos are the exact same. the maps are the same. The AI is still the same. It is still the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ass game it was a few months back when i regret paying like 15 or whatever bucks for a game. Stay away from this. Seriously, unless your absolutely bored and u have less then 2 GB of storage to mess with, along with a mouse that if you can click 16 shots in less then 1 milli then your absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed in online PVP matches, run by the little kids who think there cool Because they host a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ listen server off there parents internet. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, im out
4926	0	a	Wait times are too long to get into the fun. You join a game, have to watch other people play for 5+ minutes before any fun starts.
4927	0	a	What sort of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing computer do you need to run this game, i mean i got 12 FPS ON THE MENU. You know you have screwed up somewhere if your menu runs at 12 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing frames. 2/12 thanks alot Valve. Oh and say i have a bad computer bad it says i have over the recommended
4928	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4929	0	a	This is the biggest piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i've played since sonic 06! It lags constantly even though i have a computer with system requirements AND i even uninstalled all my games to make sure that it would run and it even managed to crash my computer multiple times!
4930	0	a	I purchased a four pack for around $3. After installing it and playing for a little short of an hour, I can report that it has poor graphics, subpar gameplay, and is more than a little repititious. Spend your time elsewhere. To those I start to send copies out to, I owe you apologies.
4931	0	a	To simply put....Stay far away from this game if you have really, really poor server connectivity or a bad gaming rig or don't have a gaming CPU to begin with first off 7,000+ are playing this game and that's because they have GREAT server connectivty these dev's want you to create your own lobby and sit on your butt for about 2 hours or so until it's filled up but that will never happened do to a laggy, or buggy interface during finding online matches   I really want to love this game but the fact that it doesn't have it's own 'sever check program' and what that means is that the game if it has online mode should've checked the player's online/internet connections to see if his or her rig is up to playing and or connecting to a game or even play it for that matter the fact that it may cause spazzing during loading time and has the main menu glitched into the loading screen causing THAT to spazz out....what that really means basically is that the game 'can not connect to host'   If you don't have the patience to wait hours and hours on end for people to join your sever then don't play this game, delete it and play something else with better server connectivity and a very next to nill buggy interface.  Lastly two things:  1. Don't trust Metacritic because that review was from a different game honestly the game by checking out the screen shots feels like a 8/10 for some but for me? a 7/10   2.Don't trust the reviews by the gamers for this game what they failed to mention is that this game will be great to those who have a really, really good gaming rig with best online and internet connections and really, really bad to those who don't have a great gaming rig
4932	0	a	the game seems like its an amazing concept. but thats it. after 5 minutes in game i fell through the world 4 times, failed to buy guns, was thrown into a server with no explanation on the controls and was eaten by a dino twice. after which i figured out how to use my mic by going into options and was explained to by another newb how to buy guns. the next time i respawned i couldnt move or use in game chat. i havnt seen a game this buggy since i played CS 1.6 with a ping of 800 on dial up. the developers are just trying to boom support for their kickstarter which i hope they fail because they dont desserve to be in business with a game this buggy. i fear to even consider what it was 'before' they 'fixed it'   0 stars
4933	0	a	its HARD to say if i recommend it or not, its not a total waste of 0.99 cents  its fun in the begining, but the gameplay its buggy, the Dinos MAIN PURPOSE is just to rush you....RUSH you until you kill it... i would rather suggest to save the $$ for a better game like killing floor or something better than this :D ~~~~~~~UPDATE~~~~~~ I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT ALL  The gameplay isnt smooth always buggy/shaky/etc the Bots are weak and terrible in solo play i say the bugs RUINS THE GAMEPLAY
4934	0	a	Controls are bad, visuals are bad, options menu does not save changes.
4935	0	a	Eh this game gets boring after 30 minutes when bullet sponging, repetitive layouts, and terrible connections plague your experience.   &gt;inb4 gr8 b8 m8
4936	0	a	Started off â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, became good after some love and craft, now it's gone to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ once again. The weather effects alone ruined everything.
4937	0	a	The systems at play here just did not grab my attention. I thought it might be interesting to hunt dinosaurs in these large and open arenas, but I continually felt pestered by the smaller enemies, and the large enemies could be quite spongy. However, at this point, the online servers may not be as populated as they once were. More players and teamwork might make the title more enjoyable.
4938	0	a	One of the worst games I have ever played. No instructions on how to get started or what you're supposed to do.
4939	0	a	Very buggy, alot of glitches, fun for 10 mins... 
4940	0	a	not a very good shooter. Good if you have no money and a subpar computer .
4941	0	a	This game is god awful. right from the start you know its bad, because the game doen't even have a tutorial! so the first 10 minutes you are running not knowing what your doing, and have no idea how to get any weapons so you can actuall do anything. The textures are terrible, they are so low resoulution, that they look like games from the n64! the only good thing about the graphics are your player model, and even that is only decent at best. The voice acting is decent, but not up to par with todays standards, heck even the legend of zelda from the phillips cdi was better. The only good thing about this game is menu, ant that's because it has artwork, that is kinda cool to look at. And the net code for this game is terrible, not worse then brink's but that's not saying much. All in all i would give this game a 3/10. It has got to be one of the worst game i've ever played, I urge you not to buy it, even if it is only a dollar, it is that bad.
4942	0	a	the graphics are bad alot of lags the ingame skins cost actual money to purchase and this game is just boring it has no plot and no consept except playing with friends and if you dont have at least 3 more friends that play this game this game is just boring
4943	0	a	If you want to play a good dino game, dont try this. Very low budget game, but this isnt a problem. The models are low resolution, servers are laggy, and much more.
4944	0	a	Even though it has a gamemode where you can play as a dino but its not that fun deinosuchus hardly works for me i cant kill anyone I hate that my fav dino raptor only has one attack never choose raptor if your playing with pro players I dont even try to play as compy ptera the only dinos that are good spino,trex,triceratops,stegasaurus i didnt even remeber the rest of the dinos if there are more even for the price its at i still dont like it
4945	0	a	I do not recommend this game considering it was gifted to me by a friend to play early, now they want more money again. Something wrong there. Not worth it as far as im concerned.
4946	0	a	Although it is much better then Dino Beatdown, it is a poor excuse for a game still.
4947	0	a	Horrible game with horrible graphics... Also there are a lot of bugs for example sometimes its not showing that the gun firing effect while I m firing... Also graphic optimization is horrible as well and there is not goal on playing any map. This game do not deserve to play. Do not buy it and do not make some useless pc programmers rich...
4948	0	a	This is Bad
4949	0	a	The concept is nice but the controls are crap. Sometimes you're able to move normally, sometimes you can't strafe for some reason, and sometimes you just can't move at all. It wasn't worth the dollar I spent on it.
4950	0	a	Frame are complete â™¥â™¥â™¥, and it's not because of my PC. Worst optimized game of all time, uninstalled
4951	0	a	needs better optimization
4952	0	a	i was tricked by all the good reviews into downloading orion,its nothing new and not worth ur time,terrible bad grahics,bad font,game screen looks dated and biggest downer was tht as i started playing i thought' what the heck?' im running faster than dinos and its almost like a arcade shooter or a shooting range hitting carboard like dionos,so u can hate me for putting it like this...but u dont want to do this - go play on ur mobile!
4953	0	a	I dont like this game and I dont recommend it to anyone,you will have to pay it for 6 days,you just shoot in this game it has no point,so if you like first person shooter games without a story this is for you,but if you dont you shouldnt play it.It should be free to play,because its to stupid to pay for it.
4954	0	a	Heyyo,  I bought it because the devs continuously build onto the game and that's cool and all... but it's still sadly broken when it comes to the AI... lots of the AI can be easily defeated by just strafing in a circle and it'll never catch you... so with easy to defeat AI? I can't recommend this game. There's better Swarm games on PC like Hard Reset.
4955	0	a	Altough its cheap its not bad, but its not too good, lets go to plus and minus  +Its cheap +Dinosaur +Good graphic +Good control  -It doesnt have any player online -Its single mode suck -Bad AI  Maybe you should buy the new Orion game, its on Kickstarter
4956	0	a	4/10 it's not worth the $15
4957	0	a	never let me go into a game i just looked at people and things run by
4958	0	a	This game has good gameplay, but the idea of having to WAIT in order to respond, is simply ANNOYING; I'd rather be the dinosaurs and hunt the soldiers, instead!  But no; the GAME DOESN'T LET YOU CHOOSE TO BE ONE! Not in Survival mode, at least. This game is a decent deal for 3 bucks, because it currenty acts like cheap overrated shovelware. So, for effort, the designs and music are great, but waiting for SEVERAL MINUTES makes the only fun of waiting, being a 'troll' by making cheesy puns and jokes. If the game doesn't allow you to do that, then I'd be having much more fun, by playing Xbox 360 'kinect' games; as long as the controls work okay, and the gameplay is ACTUALLY FUN!  My advice? You can probably find better USED games for less, from certain 'bargain' stores; heck, I even found a copy of Freedom Force, (which still has the code, on the back of the CD case) for only 1 dollar! Heck, if I can't find a patch to make it work on Windows 8, I'd probably have to buy it on Steam, so it WILL MORE LIKELY WORK!
4959	0	a	This game honestly isn't that good, I am glad I got it on sale when it was a dollar. All the game is, is to reactivate reactors over and over while killing dinosours. There are vehicles to get to the reactors faster, but honestly I left the game minutes after I realized it lags when I shoot. I would rate this game 2/10
4960	0	a	WTF IS THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! DONT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!
4961	0	a	Wow even for 50 cents I feel robbed. Takes a lot for me to make a comment and being a Steam user for many years this is my first review. DON'T BUY it!!!!!!
4962	0	a	Why did I actually pay money for this piece of crap?
4963	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do not buy it it sucks vagazle for money

4976	0	a	I read some reviews of this game and heard it was really bad, so of course I bought a 4-pack to play it with some friends and laugh at the badness of it. I wish I didn't waste â‚¬ 2.24 on it, it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horrendous, don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game, it's not worth it even with the 51% discount right now.

So this is not putting me in a happy mood. i'm glad I can buy it for friends now, but change your price back to twenty. Or are you just that cheap, like the Thai Hooker down the street! - Crimson Bolt.
4986	0	a	This game for me was too laggy. Can't join or play. Even if I could, the gameplay wasn't as fun as one may think. Sorry, but this game honestly isn't worth it.
4987	0	a	the music is really laggy aswell as gameplay
4988	0	a	Horrid.  You are much better off with Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day.   1/10
4989	0	a	Controller support is there but cant invert Y axis. So that's useless to me. Most servers are locked. I got STUCK on a building in first 3 mins of game play. Graphics look like original xbox.

4992	0	a	Well you watch new vids, you see the price and look for reviews. You can imagine this game would be nice to play. Even for just few mins of fun... but no.  Fighting dinosaurs is funny one time. 5 sci-fi soldiers per map against waves of A.I controled dinos. Between waves , you have to purchase gear, each kill give you cash you can spend in your base (starting point). But devs didnt though i would be nice to bring the 2 damm buildings needed to buy weapons and upgrades close each other... Indeed when you have 50 secs after each waves, you loose nearly 20 secs to reach thoses two buildings... annoying.  Some weapons are nice, but others are just useless, in general weapons doesn't have this 'feeling' of power you can have in most shooters.   Vehicles are dispached on the map, the interresting thing is the ability of support class (3 classes at the end) to repair vehicles. The unlimited amount of vehicles wich is quite annoying in games today was replaced here by the need to spare them. Good idea ! The problem is that vehicles are horrible to handle. One guy told me 'this is halo's driving style'. Here this is worst ! You will scream against dinos who will knock back your vehicle especially the mech wich is a scam. Vehicles weapons overheat. The Hud overheat indicator is not appropirate and will stuck you many times during battles.  For foot fighting; you will hate this game when a big dino will chase you and, in an act of courage, you will take him down by yourself and die like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because one minor dino blocked you on the way of your retreat. Because you can't go trough them. In this game, movements are not realistics like third person view where your torso is stuck as if you had a rake in the ... hum... you got the idea.  But he most annoying: crashes. For many years i never had a game such impossible to stop ! After 100 mins of playing the game crashed. It it was just impossible to stop the executable ! Amazing... especially when you succeed by closing your session, again you launch the game and... nothing. The game launched apparently steam recognize it but... nothing. No executable, no icon, nothing.  When you enter the game you see a banner where devs are planning to launch a kickstarter for a new game with AGAIN sci-fi soldiers vs dinos BUT this time in an open world. Hey Devs ! If you wanted some cash for your kickstarter you got 1 buck but you won't get anything else from me !  Note they dared to add some kind of item shop in the game (with their scandalous promoting vids !) . I didn't really browse it but francly they've boasted a bit too much of their game to think people will buy more than this title.  If you wan't to slaughter dinos (and humans) go on primal carnage wich much more interresting.
4993	0	a	ok i know i dont have a mega super Â£10000 pc but i can generally run most games with about 20fps on mid graphics, but this this game. i dont know where to start. i dont know what the gameplay is like because it runs too badly for me to play. i put it on lowest graphics and i get about 4fps if im lucky. when i tried to play it on mid graphics it froze and what i could tell by the screen where horrid graphics. luckly my friend paid for it not me.

4996	0	a	Honestly, after a second ''remake'' and content update...it is still as buggy, cheap and boring as before. Seriously dissapointing and a waste of money.  I highly respect the devs for their devotion and the love they put in the game...but it is not enough.
4997	0	a	Not that fun and there are barrely any in game sounds
4998	0	a	Haha, it's even funny. It's REALLY bad! I don't think i have words to describe it.  Good thing it was only $1.
4999	0	a	Purchased this game long ago and asked for a refund as it was THAT bad.   There are so many bad things to say about it:  1) Gameplay feels weightless and unsatisfying  2) Multiplayer is lifeless and unabsorbing  3) It feels pointless, unrewarding and repetitive 4) There is no demo, which means people waste their money buying the full version, which is dreadful

5001	0	a	In short, this game is Killing Floor with dinosaurs, but subpar. You survive waves of  zombies  dinos, earn money for killing them and buy progressively bigger and nastier guns with them. Sounds pretty straightforward, and it is. The problems with this game are that it's unbalanced, looks worse than Unreal Tournament 2004 (but still runs horribly) and feels very amateurish for a comercially sold game.  For starters, there's only one class out of the 3 you are offered that is actually worth anything, and that is the Assault class (the guy with the jetpack). The other ones have a cloaking mode and a healing gun, but they aren't worth giving up the ability to NOT DIE when you are picked up by a pterodactyl, stop yourself from being mobbed or casually fly around the triceratops that you are pumping full of lead.  There are a bunch of purchaseable guns on offer when you finish a wave, but most of them are either too weak or have horrible accuracy/recoil, so expect to use the same guns on every match. Or you could drive around in a warthog-ish buggy and have some guy man the turret (or man it yourself) to become almost invincible to the dinosaurs.  There are some things that Dino Horde does right, though. It mixes it up by having you defend generators, fight boss dinosaurs, and move around to different bases, which breaks up the monotony quite a bit, and it is rather satisfying once you get a hold of one of those badass turrets, admittedly.  I feel a bit bad for bashing an indie game, and honestly, if you're the forgiving sort, you may get a good amount of fun out of this game, but there are better games you can play about surviving waves of enemies. There are better games about blowing dinosaurs up. There are none to my knowledge about surviving waves of dinosaurs, though, so if you have a fixation for surviving a horde of prehistoric reptiles (perhaps it's the only way you can get it up, i'm not judging you :-D) then pick it up in a sale or something.
5002	0	a	Played this game for not even 20 minutes, I got into a game at everything at medium and I get constant stutters, my team mates teleport everywhere and I had no f_uck1ng idea where any dinosaurs were cause I crashed a car into a f_uck1ng wall and died.  This game is honest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I would've played with friends, but they refunded it, before it became f2p
5003	0	a	BACK WHEN THE GAME WAS CALLED ORION HORDE i liked this game, its was defo worth the money,team work was the key.was fun with friends and these people who say its crap they have not played enough to warrent calling it crap.a must buy for 99p/ $0.99 i retract this statment ^^ its utter garbage ...chagend the game so much its not even the same game and as for the stealling content thing well GG orion GG  DONT BUY THIS GAME NOT EVEN FOR 1P /$0.01  DONT SUPPORT THIS GAME IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM  DONT LISTEN TOO ME I'M ONLY A PANDAWW I RAN OUT OF BAMBOO THIS MORNING AND I'M HUNGRY  lol   WORST VIDEO GAME EVERRRRR!!!!

5006	0	a	What can I say? I only bought this for my friends and myself as a joke and paid 0,50â‚¬ when it was on sale.. and that was way too much.   Let's list some 'features': No actual gameplay (except for running and shooting), UI is from the early 2000's and is horrible to use, artstyle (if you can speak of art in the same sentence) is mostly just mimiced from big sci-fi titles, the soundscape is just plain wrong...  Oh, and did I mention that the game is full of bugs? Ah, sorry no, it isn't full of bugs IT IS a fricking bug. The bright side is that the bugs are mostly hilarious (try driving a car head on to a dino).   That doesn't make the game entertaining or anything though. Let's just say it aloud: It's rubbish. And what I've heard, the devs (if you dare call them game developers) have been selling the game under different titles for ages. So basically, they're frauds and should not be allowed to publish anything in the first place.   I hope someone reads this. If I manage to save a single euro, dollar, yen or whatever from being spent on sh*t like this, I can die in peace.
5007	0	a	I want to like this game, so bad. but inbetween a terrible player base and constantly losing connection ive yet to play a full game from start to finish. the 7 hours i played is not alot relatively speaking, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, youd think youd at least play 1 game all the way through. Other players leave you to die, steal your vehicle leaving you stranded and take your equipment after you die. Not to mention the constant series of kicks ive gotton after simply going down once after i join 4 or 5 waves in.  If by chance these things dont frustrate you and you manage to hurdle past these issues, the connectivity is so wonky youll disconnect in the midst of a fire fight.  This game has a great premise and wonderful execution, iand i desperatley want to like it, but god damn is it hard. maybe my experience is unique to me alone but thats my review
5008	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.. It doesn't ever want to work whenever i start it up. It loads for a second then stops working when i try to play solo. It also doesn't let me join any online games. 0/10 no joke.... i paid money for a game that should be F2P since it doesn't work

5029	0	a	Not worth 20$. When I play Orion:Dino Horde, I think I'm playing Halo but I'm slaughtering hulking dinosaurs instead of convenants. Overall, the graphics aren't too bad, but the AI for the dinosaurs are a bit messy.
5030	0	a	While I would recommend the game if you could get it for around two dollars like I did, I couldn't recommend a full purchase. The game runs horribly on even outstanding systems. The idea is at least interesting. I give the game that it has one of the more unique ideas out there, but its charm dimms a little after extended play. The gameplay is fun throughout with good upgrades, and challenging enemies, but it also containes some annoying bugs. If you do get it, get it on sale. Be prepared for extreme temperatures too.

5034	0	a	This game is really not that well developed. The graphics are very good but the game is not optimized well at all. I only get about 50-60 fps on max settings with a gtx 760. I can run more demanding games past 100 fps. Also not to mention th animations for the dino's are very cheap looking and in all I really wouldn't reccomend this game. The servers are not hosted by the game developers which means someone will be hosting the game through their internet so if they lag the whole game does and almost every game I joined everybodys ping was through the roof.
5035	0	a	there is a reason this masterpiece is only a dollar.
5036	0	a	This game sucks. You're probably here because 'Hey it's a dinosaur shooting game! Let's try it', trust me I felt the same way too but when I started playing, it's not how it is in trailers and videos. It's really boring, weapons are really dull and the environment is bland. The dinosaurs sometime looks like they're floating and chasing after you. You know, i've tried the other dinosaur games like Dino D-Day and Primal Carnage and have both. They are much more worth than this! You're only gonna buy it if it's free or under a dollar, other than that don't get this.
5037	0	a	LAME, uninstalled this turd soon after playing it for a bit.
5038	0	a	ok i know i dont have a mega super Â£10000 pc but i can generally run most games with about 20fps on mid graphics, but this this game. i dont know where to start. i dont know what the gameplay is like because it runs too badly for me to play. i put it on lowest graphics and i get about 4fps if im lucky. when i tried to play it on mid graphics it froze and what i could tell by the screen where horrid graphics. luckly my friend paid for it not me.

5041	0	a	The game itself has/had good promise. When I first saw it I thought 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs? Count me in!' But the game turned out to be decent fun, but with glaring issues. It is very poorly optimized. It was impossible to aim right to hit anything, and yet things still died. IDFK. The devs made promises (like fixing the technical issues, which is why I even played for more than 4 hours) which they either decided not to or never intended to keep, quickly turning this game (which has gone through 3 not very major iterations) into abandonware shortly after the prelude 'content' update. (It was really just a few logos, like train simulator 15/16/17/etc.) and then moving on to orion. Of course, I didnt realize any of this before putting down my cash for both games. (I'm a sucker for $0.49 deals). The second game is also crap, though i won't go into that here. Long story short, don't give these guys your money. Even for a $1.  TL;DR STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND ITS DEVS.

5043	0	a	the optimization is awefull
5044	0	a	I have no idea, a long long time ago this had a free weekend and i played it and it was actually kinda fun. i bought they game now cause its dirt cheap so why not and it is awful. Performance is extremely bad and poor optimization. games that look better even on lowest setting i can run them on higher settings anyways. this game looks awful and even on lowest settings im getting all sorts of frame drops and stutters. Theres not many servers, and rarely any fun servers with fun people. I don't see big dinos as much as i nearly used to back on that free weekend. the guns are nearly unusable, having no recoil and it feels like im shooting a pea shooter, yet dinos die extremely easy, and even on the hardest difficulty, i found it really easy. the vehicles feel stiff and also nearly unusable. not a good game, not even worth 99 cents

5052	0	a	This game has a potentially fun concept, but confusing graphics, awkward maps, stuttering dinos, and a host of other issues leave much to be desired. Perhaps future updates will change this review, but as of now, I can think of way better ways to spend time shooting stuff.

Its good for a laugh in the first 5 minutes but its really really not that good. within my first game i was knocked under the map and couldn't do anything about it. It is only 1 dollar and thats what its worth 1 dollar because its not a good game and frankly not worth playing.

5059	0	a	If you major in psychology than Spiral Game Studios is perfect subject for Dunning-Kruger effect study. So it might be worth your time - it's fun to watch, to read forums and to laugh at devs. Self-confidence boosted by vocal minority. Isn't that cute?  The game itself is not worth mentioning. It's your typical 'rip-off-everything' made by complete amateurs. Yeap, you may play it and even enjoy it... if you have absolutely no taste, your IQ is lower than 50, you are 6yo and it's the only game you have at the same time. And even in that case you'll be bored in a half an hour. So buy yourself some iOS game instead.

5061	0	a	The developer of this game stole assets from the CoD series!
5062	0	a	Fun for a laugh but considerably less polished than co-op shooters like Payday and L4D.
5063	0	a	Well, the system requirments are way off. I have a AMD Phenom 2 970 Quard @ 2.2GHZ 4 GB DDR3 and an ATI HD 4250 with 256 MB. When I checked the specs on this, my system should have been able to play this. All settings to low ... still lags very badley.
5064	0	a	Once upon a time I gave this game some praise and said it was janky but fun! Unfortunately, then all the content dried up, a microtransaction shop was added (along with the maps cut in the last pre-Horde patch), and the game effectively turned into a just-fixed-enough-to-be-dull game instead of a hilarious drinking game.  If you buy this, only buy this with friends who know what they're getting into, and who will certainly play with you. Also have fun waiting for a sale, because the devs have sat out the past two major Steam sales for... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ knows why.
5065	0	a	The developer keeps re-releasing the same game under different names, and they steal assets from other games and then try to paint themselves as the victims. Plus, the developer goes around on Internet forums threatening to sue people for talking about those two facts. Complete scum.
5066	0	a	The metascore is real. Don't believe what they say about fixing the game.
5067	0	a	Do not spend money on this game.  This game seems interesting in premise, and as it may be fun at first, if you spend a few hours with this game you realize that it isn't open world like it says it is. It is also grotesquely repetitive and there isn't enough in this game to warrant a buy. I bought this game when it was ORION Dino Beatdown and was excited for an update, and it came in the form of hats and microtransactions. I am disappointed with the quality of this game and the potential that was lost with the greedy transition into a microtransaction game.

5077	0	a	Forgive me lord for I have sinned  Seriously though, this game is incredibly bland and comes off as very ametureish. The UI looks terrible, the game still has lots of bugs, the environments are crazy bland (And WAY too big IMO,) the music is generic as hell, enemies are as dumb as they come and the gunplay just isn't that great. Sure, the game is usually $1 when it's on sale, and I've definitely gotten some great games for just $1 but here, it's not worth it. If you want a horde-mode style game that badly, just get Killing Floor. If you want a competitive shooter, get Counter Strike. If you really want to play a dinosaur shooter, I highly recommend the much more enjoyable Primal Carnage. Orion just isn't worth your time or money.
5078	0	a	Completely unfinished and broken. DO NOT BUY.
5079	0	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5080	0	a	it does not work on my screen so i cant play it
5081	0	a	This is the most worst. The gameplay isn't as fun as other dinosaur games I've played. Who the hell manages to make being a freaking dinosaur not fun?! Movement is glitchy and slow, leaving you open to be gunned down by the human players EASILY, even as the tankiest of dinos. The sounds are horrible - either loud and screeching to punish headphone users, or bland and forgettable. Never, EVER press the roar button if you wear headphones. YOU WILL REGRET EVERYTHING.  When the game makes even walking around the map a tricky chore, LET ALONE COMBAT, you know something's horribly wrong.   Play Primal Carange instead if you want some fun dino vs human action. PC isn't perfect by any means, but it gets you what you want: violent, chaotic combat mixed with some stealthy hunting in between. Also silly cheesy dialogue, if that's your thing. And while the t-rex is loud in that game, at least it doesn't attempt to rupture your eardrum like Orion does - and roaring as the T-rex does something useful! In PC, roars trigger different abilities for the dinosaurs. Neat. Also you can make the T-Rex headbang to music and that counts for a lot in my book. 
5082	0	a	basically a poor mans evolve
5083	0	a	Aside from the dev being super shady, this game is just as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as it's price suggests.

5085	0	a	No. Not a horrible game, *ahem* REVALATIONS 2012 *ahem* but still not good. It's trying to be Borderlands, but it's failing. Meh graphics, meh gunplay, meh fun. Good way to describe it: Meh. I'd give it maybe a 2/10 or a 3/10.
5086	0	a	THIS GAME...... no, this THING is awful  The Ai is completely broken, just jetpack to the nearest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rock and they will sit there thinking 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! I wish I evolved to jump instead of choosing to inhabit a world full of deadly cliffs, eternal rain and trees that look like they exist, but don't'  At least the devs and dinos have a few things in common, like brains the size of wall nuts and trying to sell anything so they can buy a slab of dry meat.
5087	0	a	Terrible game. You know it's kind of red flag-ish when it's one dollar, so you should stop there, but if you're like me and get this game, you'll see what I mean. Introduced immediately with really shoddy-looking menus, and overall terrible interface, you see microtransactions everywhere so you can level up too. Then, once finally joining a decent game that doesn't kick you out after the first minute, you just see really, really, really ugly gameplay that's like a bad version of Killing Floor, but even worse. It's an open map with waves of dinosaurs that progressively get harder after waves where you get better too, but the dinosaurs just have a weird way of fighting that's so awkward and clunky it isn't fun. I could rant on for hours about how lacking this game is, but I think this summarizes it. Verdict: Awful game and should be never played by anyone.

5094	0	a	The Metascore is misleading? This game got a user score of 3.9, yeah, misleading; sure;)
5095	0	a	This game is so much fun for a couple of hours. When you play it with friends. Then it loses it's luster. It's got a nice premise, but it is also repetitive. As I'm writing this, I suppose they're adding more content. That should do the game a world of good. The graphics are nice, but the controls need some work. I have an Xbox 360 controller that didn't seem to work with this game. It was still alot of fun, but I can't imagine playing this alone.
5096	0	a	After spending half an hour going through lobbies and never entering a single game, I uninstalled.
5097	0	a	This game is basically Call of Duty Ghosts: Extinction mode or Black Ops: Zombies mode - but no way near as good in terms of quality; and with Dinosaurs.  Only buy if cheap.
5098	0	a	Running from giant dinosaur. Dinosaur gets stuck on a small rock step. Free kill easy wins gg no re topkeklol. 10/10 would not recommend.
5099	0	a	99 Cents huh? why not.... thats what i thought. ok this game might be good but my problem is that the game just doesnt work, i can have this on the lowest GFX and get 20 fps i can have this on the highset GFX and get 20 fps...do you know why? i dont. i can run games like bioshock and blackops 2 just fine bioshock at 60 on max gfx and blackops 2 at 40-50 fps med GFX. so why cant i run this game? i just want to know because this (to me) doesnt look better than blackops 2 or bioshock. and for that reason a solid NO will be in order. (its the steam summer sale go get a good game like system shock 2... i wish i had)
5100	0	a	i payed for this useless thing and now its free its not even a real game
5101	0	a	I'm quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn't even sure if it was a different game. Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.   Would like to see some sort of 'finality' (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else). The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.

5111	0	a	...Wow, that was pretty bad.  This is what took place In the ten minutes I could handle playing.  I was placed in the tropics with no back story. After a couple of minutes to prepare, a horde of Luddite Velociraptors started â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing up the generator 100 meters from camp (I think it's a camp). Once you kill them, another swarm of dinos appear with the same vendetta. That's it...if that sounds like a good time, give it a try. It's free for a week.

5129	0	a	Less fun than drowning.
5130	0	a	Ewww...  While this Game may look like fun on first sight it has some serious flaws.  It runs on Unreal Engine 3 utilising Direct3D9 as it's API and is just on default not utilising Hardware Great which only gets strengthened by 3rdparty developers(T-REK 'Industries?') not having heard of Texture Porting and proper VRAM allocation , speaking of the game not even trying to really using those juicy amounts of Virtual Ram your Dedicated GPU has. yea those 4/8 GB lying idle while your frames Keep dipping is how a game is ment to be played.  Second Concern . As above already the game is already not doing too well regarding performance right out of the bat , want to hear a bigger joke. the choice of closed source PhysX as Physics Engine by a 3rdParty Company which already struggles with making peoples hardware work in their game.  Mediocre choice of Graphic options : Oh boy . yea as you launch it you'll find yourself in the Menu with . uhm pardon . A few Options to change. Such as Textures , 'FX Quality'.. the usual.  what it doesn't give you is anything you'd want .: Sound Quality? , cap your FPS at anything else than your monitors refresh rate , half of it or uncapped. set custom Qualitys for Anything included in any setting. Bloodsplatsize, WeatherFX threshold , decal quality , disable Weather FX , lightning , shadowmapsize and so on.   I think as far as this goes we're done with how well the game is ment to be played. pun intended.  Gameplaytime bois.  -Static weaponmodels. -Stiff Animations. -Imported Gametextures are lowresolution and high on performanceloss. -The Charactersounds seem to be recorded in a bathtub with the cheapest ebay mic and directly put into SV and rendered into 192kb/s. -Ai (to be fair even making a semi adequate one is really hard) is outright stupid , gets stuck in defaulted maps which i would ignore if not for the fact that they're made in a fixed loadout and not fully RNG and has weird hitboxes. -Maps are buggy , you can jump seemingly out of bounds , get stuck in random spots , reach spots where you're invisible to the ai , Flat Design , poor detail , and is one large map rendered on launch which explains the poor fps on some machines( Conquest). -Characters and lines are plain and boring , while fun at first you'll get bored of it after a few hours. and maybe annoyed by it after a while longer.  I do not recommend the purchase , it might be fun for an evening or two but it just fails to offer replayablity. in addition to that it runs like Crysis on a post Millenium PC. ( Having no PhysX hardware support that is.)

5135	0	a	this is a horrible game
5136	0	a	ORION: Prelude is a game about people fighting dinosuars in multiple game modes with weapon upgrades and player buffs as well as having the ability to play as a Dinosaur from Raptors to the giant Spinosuarus. On the surface, it seems really fun and a LOT like Primal Carnage, but this game is VERY buggy, which probably explains why it's regularly 99 cents. (I got it for 40 cents on sale.) There are very bad camera glitches as a dinosuar that make playing correctly impossible with the only solutions being either dying or re-joining the game. It's also isn't very balanced with players on the dinosuar side being able to pick boss dinosuars like the T-rex and Spinosuarus from the get-go, which are dinosuars that are VERY hard to kill with starter weapons. The textures aren't that great, the controls, especially for the Dinosuars, are very bad, the animations will kill you on the inside, and it gets very boring after a short ammount of time. This game may be cheaper, but I'd save for Primal Carnage or The Isle if you want to play a Dinosuar survival game. This game DOES give you lots of easy awards, though. So, there's that.

Its actually really fun but the reason why I made this review a bad one, is that the community of this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing garbage. I have died in the past because I got crushed by my own CAR! So you know what this tard does, he doesn't revive me, he grabs my car and drives away and leaves me. Mind you, this is not the only time this had happened. There have been many times where I sometimes got crushed by my own vehicles. Now I understand if you are against a T-Rex at point blank range and you can't revive me, but sometimes, there are like 4 people attacking the same damn dinosaur and while I'm dying at the back, they will ignore you and leave you to die and lose all your gear. Another problem is the vehicles. Let's say for example I go do the objective, and once I finish it, I get a helicopter or a jeep as a reward, but then some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ charges in while I'm killing dinosaurs, preparing to get into my car and this guy just takes it and drives away and leaves me a with a T-Rex while I'm heavily wounded.  So here is my overview of the review. The gameplay is awesome and really fun and the graphics are pretty good for a one euro game but the community is absolutely terrible, they will leave you even when they are in no harm at all, people who done nothing for the team will charge and steal all your vehicles.  5/10
5143	0	a	A long time ago, my mother made me go outside all the time. I did not want to, as I believed that I could do something better with my life, such as play quality games. And, I had heard the odds of cancer forming within my poor little body if I obeyed her wishes. I did not want to get cancer. During the times I refused to go outside because of these two factors, I looked far and wide for quality gameplay. Low and behold, Steam was found. I downloaded Steam. An eager chap I was, wishing to play all the fun and popular games. I avoided cancer at all costs. I did not smoke, I did not partake in any nefarious activities, and most importantly, I did not go outside. It appears my efforts were wasted anyways, as this game gave me cancer.
5144	0	a	I haven't bought this game and I can write a review? That is pretty dumb.
5145	0	a	Rewrite time! Although this game is, most definately, fixed from its Dino Horde days, the game is quite poorly optimised. I bought the four pack, and gave one copy away so I could play it with a friend. He managed to play it. I was getting 15 FPS on the title screen, and I was worried about the gameplay, so I went and set the graphical settings as low as they get. Me and my friend create and join a game. 8-10 FPS. Although I am not playing on a gaming PC, this could run Farming Simulator 15 (Not in my library I have it on disc) at a stable 40 FPS on medium graphics, Arkham asylum at 50 FPS on medium, PS2 at 20 FPS on low, and PVZ Garden warfare (Yes, I use origin as well as steam, hate if you will) at 30 on medium.   EXPLAIN YOUR OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS PLEASE!  My friend, who does have a custom built gaming PC that can run PS2 on ultra high at 200 FPS, said that the game was easily broken (A ton of glitching dinosaurs) and the vehicles were too OP.   I'm sure it can be fun... but it does not work well. 2/10.

5148	0	a	I bought this game when it was $9.99. I regret that decision.    3.6/10  
5149	0	a	other than it being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it's still pretty bad. models are janky as and it's badly optimized
5150	0	a	Want my money back since now it's free and I paid like $4 for this game.
5151	0	a	Even free it's not worth it.
5152	0	a	Total waste of money, i could feed a whole african village with that 1$. The game runs like complete **** and looks like a bad version of halo and borderlands together.
5153	0	a	Complete and utter trash. The guns are unbalnced, exploits every where, hackers,and servers with exp boost.
5154	0	a	At first, i thought the game looked cool, you know, dinosaurs, guns, eplosions, Michael Bae, etc When i first started the game was on high graphics so i wasnt too fussed, turned it to low and i still got 20 fps when i can run dino d-day (much better dino game) at 60 fps on ultra!  i bought this game for my friends and believe me..........don't get this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5155	0	a	Personally, I hate it. I mean really not worth even 99 cents. The graphics are mediocre at best and the level objectives are compleatly confusing.not to mention that i don't even think you can play as a dinosaur in a game that revolves around them. It's like the developers said, 'Hey, you know what would be cool? If we had 'Call of Duty' and 'Jurassic Park' and put em' together!' Honestly, it looks like the game was made on a toaster. ---&gt;DO NOT BUY&lt;---
5156	0	a	One of the worst games iv ever played in my life.
5157	0	a	this game is horrible ,dont buy it your wasting your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ money!
5158	0	a	Pile of crap
5159	0	a	It's terrible :/
5160	0	a	Unstable game, Crashes none stop and its not my PC.  Grphics engine has major issues.   It has great potential but it keeps crashing and its unplayable.    
5161	0	a	It's terrible.
5162	0	a	boring boring boring, just it
5163	0	a	i have this game now its charging me to play it
5164	0	a	ORION: Prelude  Oh dear this game ... I do not reccoment this game ! This game is so bad optimized that it will run 40 fps if you have an nvidea geforce gtx 980. But there is even more ! The animations are wierd. Your opjective in the game is hard to know because you do not really now what you have to defend...  1 cool thing: There are HALO cars in this game !  Overall Rating: 2/10
5165	0	a	piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ crashes on start up never mind fixed it still a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5166	0	a	piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5167	0	a	Can't even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play it.
5168	0	a	This game is mad budget and really boring. Go play a game with a real horde mode like ME3 MP.
5169	0	a	Not that Good.
5170	0	a	No, I do not recommend this game.  I played a few minutes of it and already knew it was just another crappy shooter game, if you enjoy shooter games, then yeah give it a go, I enjoy shooter games but not awfuly made ones.  0/10
5171	0	a	To sum up my experience: it's a crappy left 4 dead with dinosaurs with blur that'd make you think your eyesight is going bad. 'but it's only 1 dollar kappa' CHILDREN IN AFRICA COULD'VE EATEN YOUR DOLLAR! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
5172	0	a	Good concept... but the game needs a major optimization overhaul. I don't mind sub-par graphics.... but this game has been around for a few years and boasts about the constant updates and improvements made during this time. That being the case, there is no reason why I should get ok-ish to somewhat bad FPS on this game with minimal video settings, when other games like Skyrim and Call of Duty run smoothly on MAX settings.... If you're into not-so-great visuals coupled with not-so-great FPS, then this game is for you if you're willing to throw away a dollar... As for me, I'm going back to my 'real' games that at least function well enough that problems are hardly observed....
5173	0	a	While the gameplay itself could be very entertaining, something is terribly off with this game. While I am aware my laptop isnt a powerhouse, that is no reason for the game to have such low fps. We have come to the conclusion of terrible optimization. Sadly, 2/10 for me, but I really wish it would work.
5174	0	a	Bought this one when it was on sale. Provided a bit of entertainment but then found the game a bit pointless. Maybe I'm missing something and maybe some updates have made it a bit better, but probably better off spending your money elsewhere.
5175	0	a	Fun idea, looked fun, was fun for one round. After figuring out how to play the fun really drops off.
5176	0	a	For 99 cents this isn't a bad game at all. Certainly it is much better than it used to be, and what it used to be was quite literally a broken piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. but now its become a somewhat fun game for about five minutes, then I got bored and confused and gave up. So, there's that.
5177	0	a	Don't.
5178	0	a	I BOUGHT 4 PACK FOR 2 GAP!!! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU GET SIMILAR OFFER!!! I was not going to buy this game... Ever really. It first came to me when I saw WTF is... W/e this was named back then(considering it has changed name in my own inventory by now as well who can blame me for forgetting) Devs claim game now is better than it was. I don't really have a line of my own to compare it to. However I can compare it to my impression from what I saw years ago on WTF is... .  IT'S F|_|CKIN SAME!  Yup, it looks same. Anything with a wheel controls like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I saw nobody even try to use vehicles. Now guns.... Guns don't know what recoil is. I do... It took me a while to understand that they don't.   Ok, so no recoil, shity weapons,shity driving...  Shity... Dinos... Yes dinos ... I wont go in to AI ,or lack of it because there is some, I think it is borrowed from zombie/alien shooter. Dinos look terrible even for years ago they look terrible. Maybe my texture settings are not on high maybe res isn't that good (who knows? Oh right I and 3 of my friends cozz I bought 4 pack), but dinos and not only dinos, all visuals look like CRAP-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ BUNCH OF OF IT SMEARED OVER EVERYTHING... Game looks grey even when it is not grey... If that was meant to be well then... Why do I say though that dinos look like crap? Well reason is simple: I played Dino Crisis on PS1 long ago. Those looked better. Heck I replayed it on epsxe couple years ago it still looked good. 15-20 years later (aprox.) this comes out and it looks worse. Something is wrong there.  Now I did say 2 things here First that I bought 4 pack of this so one game cost me 0.5 gap... About 0.8 suds each. Currently it is priced at 0.79gbp per 1 and 1.99 per 4 At this price you might as well buy it because: it is fun TEAM shooter where you and your team of friends will have fun. Co-op mode is the only viable mode here(do note however there are plenty of good coop games out there but this one is OK for a weekend or two)   HOWEVER that said  Second thing I said was that alien or zombie shooter has similar AI... As in it always goes towards you... IT IS HORDE SHOOTER SAME AS THIS. With many big significantly important things to keep in mind: Singleplayer, Story, Survival, Turret modes, upgrades, drop upgrades, perm upgrades, progression system shall I even continue?(no) so I'd suggest if you aim for single player or lone wolf experience... Spend 10.99 on zombie or alien shooter and play that...  Or hell better yet...  http://store.steampowered.com/app/630/  it is free And due to this I do not recommend this game
5179	0	a	Totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing booring game, spent 5 mins in spawn while wawe completed... I donÂ´t recommend this game.
5180	0	a	haha lol 'it is unreal tournament combines with jurassic park' some people are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.... and 'halo and tribes in one' ? this game is fram from those titles, and the game sucks aso much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5181	0	a	are you serious? i payed for this game and now its free...
5182	0	a	i tought i just bought saints row 4 but apparently i got orion prelude  2x=4 x=4,53 ILLUMINATIE?
5183	0	a	Well... it's not bad... but... it's not good as well
5184	0	a	Even for 40p it's utter crap. Unoptimized, boring and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics. That's all I have to say.
5185	0	a	not really dinosaurs
5186	0	a	Sucks, runs horibly with terrible graphics and glitches. It looks good on the trailer but not in real life. Maybe its just my computer idk.
5187	0	a	I couldn't play the game due to the terrible looking 'ice' obstructing my vision. I also couldn't stand the players foot steps hurting my ears, you could hear someone walking from 4 miles away as if they were right beside you.
5188	0	a	The game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ly optimized and the graphics are complete garbage. Even for under a dollar (what I got it for) it isn't worth it.
5189	0	a	i bought it and then it got deleted so i hate the game 
5190	0	a	My friend said its a good game. We're not friends anymore...
5191	0	a	Cheap and boring shooter about dinosaurs.
5192	0	a	You know what this game reminds me of? Left 4 dead. But then replace Zombies with Dinosaurs. Then make the controls built SPECIFICALLY around a controller. Then make half your targets airborne. Then make them impossible to hit. Then replace the other half with chargers and tanks. Then â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it sideways, call it Orion Prelude, and release it half â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on Steam with compelling looking art that does NOT look like the game in ANY way, then make it $0.99! 3/10!
5193	0	a	this game would be better if it werent just a plain wave survival game. theres no storyline ive found and it makes it boring fast
5194	0	a	This game is a mindless, boring shooter. You are just shooting on Dinosaurs, wchich don't even pose a threat to you. Maybe the bosses are more fun, but i quit after half an hour because the rest of the game is just boring. It's not even worth 10 cents. It's just a waste of time.
5195	0	a	Well, Its almost FREE, But sad to say Its just a time of waste if you feel like killing dinos all day with no story Progress, No well drawn people, And dont forget the Gameplay. Overall-1/10
5196	0	a	dino are too hard to kill buggy menu server button wont refresh repeats itself 2/10 would not bang
5197	0	a	It's a mediocre dinosaur shooter. The gameplay is not very compeling and the graphics are sub par.
5198	0	a	I dont... I dont even know wtf is going on anymore.
5199	0	a	this made my balls itch !  never again ....
5200	0	a	Saw the devs begging people to give the game another try, reinstalled. Game crashes constantly on startup  0/10 Free is to expensive for this game, they'd have to pay to play it, and even then it would have to be a lot
5201	0	a	Dino Horde pfft...... *whispers is not goood because i hvent played it* 
5202	0	a	i dont know how this has any good reviews save the change
5203	0	a	The fist few hours are cool but, when you get into it, it's boring.
5204	0	a	Im removing this from my account, check steam support to do that. No refund was possible, besides therea a reason its a dollar game. Don't buy this.  Also awful company, they steal other peoples work.
5205	0	a	Its Free WTF and i and have my money back :/ this steam  
5206	0	a	So if you kinda have a old computer do not get this. If you have a realy old computer definetly dont get this. I dont know if you have a brand new computer maby get this  but its probely not worth the mony
5207	0	a	The worst FPS game I have ever played.
5208	0	a	Very fun trailer. All negative critic comes from famous game observers and positive comments from some random guys, I just glad i didn't see what it was before, because after 3 YEARS OF SUPPORTING it's just terrible.

5244	0	a	This is just....
5245	0	a	The game is still crap even after all the updates its not user friendly and has texture loading and connection problems it doesent give you hints when playing. I TELL ANYONE WHO DOESENT HAVE THIS GAME {DO NOT BUY IT} i will give my copy away in a trade menu for 30 cents for anyone looking to buy.  This game should be bought by absolutly no-one. The amount of time making level's in this game should be the amount of time a player playes it for.  When you push sooooo many people away buy making a game that cost money that should be free you push away player's because of NON POPULATED server's this game is multiplayer but there is no one online to play with congrates because this game sucks.
5246	0	a	Had to buy ths game and then they make it free to play what a rip off this game is loads of fun but the dev have a long history of changing this games name to avoid the fact that they steal assets from other games.... but is a fun game once you get past the scumbagry of the devs 10/10 would get ripped off again
5247	0	a	Game has great potential but it's spoiled by the mass amounts of lag and uncomfortable experience.
5248	0	a	stephan hawking runs better than this game.
5249	0	a	Its cool if you have so much lag and cant tell whats going on and just laught with your friends but when the lag is gone...
5250	0	a	So I started playing and looked at the wall because I was checking my surround. a dinosower slid up the wall doing the walking animation then began to slide sideways on the skybox while sliding it did not have a animation so it flew like a angel on sunday 
5251	0	a	Silly gameplay occasionally glitchy with floaty controls,wouldnt recommend
5252	0	a	Wasted money on this bug ridden game 1/10 would not buy bugged games again
5253	0	a	Ordinary, recycled, and just plain confusing as there is no tutorial. Wasted a $1.09 I could have spent on a chocolate bar that would have been much more satisfying than this game.

5261	0	a	I tried it for 20 minutes and I want my 20 minutes back.  I wanted to give it a chance to see if it felt like a good shooter. It doesn't feel like a good anything. Even if it was a real piece of human excrement, it wouldn't feel like a good piece of human excrement. The weapons have ridiculous recoil, but sound more like stapleguns. I could forgive the late 90's graphics if the game had a good feel to it, but they couldn't even come close to the combat feel of something like Goldeneye.  On sale for 74 cents, eh? Free would be too expensive.
5262	0	a	this a very gud game  They have me at gun point here plz dont buy this peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥     
5263	0	a	Despite the developer's numerous attempts, Orion is still an unwhelming game at the end of the day.
5264	0	a	This game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing piece of poop pooo i mean the creators can just shove this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game up their poop shoot and jerk off each others asian size weewee's and just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this and guess what.......â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ U MOTHER â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ERS this game can suck all the dongs in the world because it's a horny â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!!!!!! s............l..................u...........t.........and it may be the jews fault white power im rotting in hell.

5266	0	a	I love a FEEL GOOD story, especially one where there is an underdog involved. I always root for the underdog. In this case the story of an underdog has nothing to do with a storyline that you follow in the game, but has ONLY to do with the developer(s) of ORION: Prelude. It is sad. Very Sad. Not because of what they went through as you would expect, but because their story about making a better game over time is ' more fictional' than the game itself. They may have worked hard but it is still TERRIBLE. Just because some people are willing to dig through the trash to find a half eaten donut does not mean it is good does it? How about a little day old meat? mmmmm.... that is what you get with this game at best... day old meat found in the back of a butcher shop on the ground next to the dumpster. If you like that, you will like this too!  MY COMPLAINT: They suckered me in to buying this game thinking that I was helping someone overcome a financial debt of time and love that they put into the shooter gaming society. As it turns out, all they did is waste my time and money. The only achievement they have truly accomplished is in getting a million plus people to buy something a million times for a buck... when it's not worth a penny! To me, that is the same thing as robbing people. They are problably laughing their butts off all the way to the bank while innocent people are paying them for trash. They are essentially bums on a street corner asking for a dollar. That's fine... I can accept that. But don't tell me that they have succeeded at doing anything except stealing innocent teens (and adults) money.  Bottom line: They say they fixed it, but it does not compare to anything else you will have in your library because nothing else LIKE THIS would have ever been released. It's that bad!
5267	0	a	frame rate are too low..
5268	0	a	Step 1 make a game thats good and fun. Step 2 make money off of it. Step 3 make the game free to play.  These steps describe this game.
5269	0	a	this game is needs improving they should make the graffics better and make the game openworld survivel.
5270	0	a	I bought 4 keys... how is this game free?
5271	0	a	I didn't think they would make a game off my favorite novel Gay T-Rex Law Firm Executive Boner but they did and man that just gets me so flaccid like on a scale from 1 to wet noodle id be angel hair spaghetti.  But for real this game is an anal shipment of crap and I hope no one suffers the same fate as i did.  3 out of a George Forerunner.
5272	0	a	This is horribly optomized dont trust the requirents this game is literally a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Tbh tho, 4/20 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5273	0	a	As someone once said 'If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything'. 10/10 IGN 'Didn't like the dinos'
5274	0	a	i have more then 1 reason why this is not a good game (bad game)  1: i playeed this 8 hours then a long time not played and then when i want to play it (today) it doe not start so i look up forums aint standing me problem so i deleted and installed again and it said missing file but it stopt the download when it said missing file -_-  2: you need a good grapihc card and or good PC
5275	0	a	dont buy this game evn if its for 1 dollar this game lags everytime. THE WORST GAME OF ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5276	0	a	Sucks. Game it self is fun but it is very hard to find a match that is not full, does not lag, or boots you. Fix that issue and game will be great.
5277	0	a	In this game you can play as a dinosaur who has to protect eggs and eat spacemen, or a spaceman who has to steal the eggs and shoot dinosaurs. I don't think much planning went into making this game, in fact I think this is just two different games, from teams who had zero communications with each other, shoved together and released for 75 cents. This is a game that Ed Wood would release if he made video games about dinosaurs. This is a game that Strong Bad would think of after drinking too much Mountain Dew.
5278	0	a	Buy this game for someone you do not like!
5279	0	a	terrible isay terrible game terrible i say who lieks dino's people that like dino's are IDIOTIC dino's suc k my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5280	0	a	This game had a fun idea but failed completely in realizing it, its poorly optimised (runs de same amount of horible on whatever setting), the enemies are juist plain boring and the 'special abilities' of your class are just plain pointless.
5281	0	a	As far as shooters go, zombies and people are the only thing I like killing!  It's fun for a while, but when you've tried all of the modes, it gets pretty boring.
5282	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbtXwbkZU9w   all poeple who like this game are like this guy
5283	0	a	Don't even bother buying this game...
5284	0	a	Meh, the game is O.K. i guess. If it kinda appeals to you, buy it. It's only 0.99$. But I wouldn't recommend it. I would rather spend 0.99 on a TF2 ticket. Right now it's just holding up space in my library. Kinda fun with friends.
5285	0	a	Crap game.
5286	0	a	MUST HAVE: fast pc in order to play right! very slow game, bad graphics. crashes when you least expect it! extreme lag, if you fix these thing would be a great game! (like tf2 but with dinosaurs)
5287	0	a	this game is not worth it
5288	0	a	This game is actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. but thats just my opinion. as soon as i started it up 1 my game lagged so bag on the title screen. 2 the game was fine in the actual game? idk why. 3 flying raptors? huh 4 dinos walking sideways. basicly flipped on there side walking on a invisible wall. 5 Lag 6 me and my friend where playing and there was a dino walking across the sky box... 7 sliding dinos with no walk animation. It might be worth it to some people but PLEASE do not waste your money.. because i can guarantee you will want a refunt in under a hour..
5289	0	a	This game is terrible. On release it felt like an Unreal Tournament 3 mod but a very incomplete one, and now it is full of content, still feels like an unpolished UT3 mod. I'd give it 3/10. Not worth it. It has potential but needs a lot more work.
5290	0	a	this game sucks
5291	0	a	I played this game for 1.2 hours total. I feel so dirty, There isn't a shower that can wash away my regrets for accepting this game on my steam list.
5292	0	a	If you have an AVERAGE pc DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Very unoptimized to the point where it's not even worth the $1. But I guess if you have a pc that is Above Average, then get this game if you must. But why would you get this game instead of playing WAAY BETTER Free To Play Games?
5293	0	a	strated to get really ticked off bought the game it worked the first time i tried playing it and now it doesnt even load when i try to play it def waste of$1
5294	0	a	50% terrible 25% hard 25% nothing 0% need to buy this game
5295	0	a	why does the dev suddenly want money for this game? i know its low priced, but to me its not worth it. uninstalling now.
5296	0	a	I paid for this game and it got for free. How dare you people do this kind of thing?
5297	0	a	10/10 Do not buy this pile of cluster â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, stinking sand eating, frogsniffing, tryhard, anal breeding prolapse.  
5298	0	a	Bought the 4-pack to play with my friends, but this game is nearly unplayable and isn't worth the $0.3725 per copy I paid. It's also funny that the devs are accused of stealing assests and right in the trailer for the game it shows quotes saying that it is a combination of other properties as a positive XD
5299	0	a	Ok, so ive had this game when it was first released as Orion: Dino Beatdown. The game then was not good. The game now is alright but still in no way good. It has been through multiple scandals and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t involving theft of other ips work and assests. Skins from Primal Carnage, taking the original despender from Natural Selection 2 and then â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing the devs of NS2 over etc. Theres just been a lot of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t with this company which renamed itself and this game. It isnt good, yes its a dollar but tbh its better off using that dollar to go buy a Mc Chicken from Mcdonalds or something.  The servers are laggy and the game isnt optimized great. Oh and there are microtransactions in the game as well so theres that and if i recall there is a helmet that is basically Boba Fett from starwars....Oh and the new activision DMCA which is legit on Activisions part. The game once upon a time had promise but now its just not even worth the Dollar. I think when i originally got the game it was more than a dollar as well so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to that.  TL:DR dont waste money on a bad game or a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ company even if its just a dollar.
5300	0	a	This is easily one of the worst games i have ever played. The game looks and plays like trash and the developers are disingenuous pigs. DO NOT GIVE THESE MEN MONEY.
5301	0	a	no wonder this game is 1 dollar dont even bother with this game its really bad
5302	0	a	fun cool game. but my computer wont run it so i have to give it a thumbs down
5303	0	a	just pure garbage. for little kids and not even. this is just stupid.  Dont bother commenting if youre butthurt. I will delete your comment and block you. This is my review my opinion deal with it.
5304	0	a	Ridiculously bad. I mean, I downloaded this thinking that it might at least be funny, but it's really very terrible. Not even in a so-bad-it's-good way, if you've ever played any other FPS at all, it'll take you one wave in survival to decide that this was a terrible decision.
5305	0	a	It looks good but when you play it it's really not, graphics on guns and dinos are nice but everything else looks terrible. Honestly this game is not worth the $.99 it costs
5306	0	a	It's still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5307	0	a	What a coinkydink, this game is similar to what comes outta my pie-hole when my diarrhea starts acting up! This game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and with what has been going on with their stolen models, I'd recommend my bowel movement products over this.
5308	0	a	There is a reason this game is $1  Firstly, for a multiplayer game there are rougly 20 servers at any given time, oh and about 18 of those are above 200 ping.  Secondly, the graphics are awful, they would have been acceptable about ten years ago. The game mode balance is hoorendous, some modes being ridiculously hard for the dino's, some the other way round. The gameplay is slow, clunky and badly designed. There is nothing good about this game, go and play ARK survival evolved as it is a much superior game.
5309	0	a	I highly recommend that you do not buy this game, because it's just a complete re-release of the previous game. The dinosaur AI is so bad, I'm sure that I could do better and the bugs oh don't get me started on them. This game is riddled with small and irritating glitches. I understand that sometimes it's very fun to play crappy games especially with a friend, but this is just too boring, broken and downright â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to play. The game has one of the most clunky and buggy menus I have ever seen in a video game and I've played kinect games which usually have shocking menus. ORION: Prelude does it's best to make sure that you do not know what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you are doing, and if you somehow work out what to do it kills all of the fun with bugs and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AI. I had to think hard to find a good thing about this game, and all I can say is the graphics aren't terrible. But to even play on these settings you need a really good pc, because I swear the developers did not do anything to try to optimise this mess of a game. From playing the game, I have concluded that this game is just a load of small bits of other games glued together with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (the warthog and ghost from Halo, the wave defense mode from Killing Floor and the gun shop and base defense from Empires). I swear the game feels like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mod or a terrible indie game cobbled together really quickly. All in all this game is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, do not buy it even though it's cheap you could spend that 80 pence on another game or something.
5310	0	a	Do it only as a joke to annoy whomever recieved it. Do not buy this for yourself as a great game to play.
5311	0	a	It worked extremely slowly on my old computer and no servers were up. Keep in mind, this was some time ago. I do not understand why I must re-buy this game to play it now.
5312	0	a	This is not worth the 50 cents i paid for it.
5313	0	a	the game sucks laggy crappy no story lame outdated graphics cant hear sound effects cheap weapons over powered dinsaurs dlc overprice you will die :)  i would not play this game with strangers or friends
5314	0	a	I paid 0.79 and i feel cheated.... After i bought this my parents are questioning my ability to make decisions. Just wait for steam sales maybe its will be worth it when its cheaper. 
5315	0	a	This is just my less-than-a-hour look at this and I must say it is no where ready for being released. It seems that this was rushed to be released without anywhere near a finished product. With no guidance or help, I started a game and became completely lost as to what I was to do next. After wondering around for a bit I stumbled on what seemed to be the right combo to get things going. Next thing I knew, after about 3 or 4 waves of creatures, I ended up in a LARGE wave with at least two T-Rex (boss) level creatures. And lots of other sized creatures. The game is confusing and slipshod... At least all of this is just my opinion after playing less than an hour. I think if they gave this more time then maybe it would be worth playing...
5316	0	a	First problem is... This developer makes you pay for the game, but then makes you pay mictrotransactions if you want to have any of the customization options with your carachter. Are you serious? A bit greed don't you think... pay for the game, and then pay more for base line options.  As for the game itself, It's fun enough for about a half hour... but then you realize there is no campaign, no story mode, no depth.... its just 'Survive X number of waves'.... over and over. Meh, I can live with that... but then you realize there isn't much depth to the gameplay either. The classes don't feel different enough from each other... and the weapons lack any distinction either.   Then there are the REALLY irritating issues like.... when you die, you have to wait 45 seconds to respawn.... and when you do, you are nowhere near your party, or the gear that you dropped when you died. Good luck making it back to the group before the wave is finished. On top of that, you lose your upgrades.... sigh,
5317	0	a	I want my $0.99 back

5321	0	a	Bought it on 2012 by the name Orion: Dino Horde and is a 4man pack too ! Played it once and left in my Library till today.  December 2015 Review.   How far Orion it has improve since this game sit untouched many years after my first gameplay. I would never imagine myself to touch this game again. It leave me a very really bad impression after my first gameplay but today Orion has make a difference in comparison to heyday.  I came back after I found out the reversal of the review been gaven, it goes from Negative to to Positive.One gotta see to believe. What can I say after a try out then letting this piece of game sit unattenended?!  Well... first of all, Do not expect any fancy or detailed graphic on this games,soundtrackwise is pretty decent and good to go with; to this you will find yourself TODAY Orion:Prelude is kind of Pretty-Cheesilly-Wonky-Onehella of Fun shooting game !! Seriously this game is FUN ! You will get alot of gun,ride a jeep,steer a tank,handle a Goliath and fly a heli-hover-plane-thingy. Not to mention there is lot of skin and hat to be applied from.  This game get really cheap when on steam sales. Buy 1 for yourself maybe a 4 man pack too as well. Sit back,enjoy the laughter and shooting frenzy with your friends. This game does earn a worth to be in your library. Give it a try today. It was insanely cheesy fun.  Well I feel like I'm the Marine in The Avatar and fighting that Blue Monkey and Toruk Maktor ! We are tryin to take over their planet after all !!!
5322	0	a	You say the game is fixed? let me tell you, I have not been able to play the game without any lag! and I have a Intel Core i7 NEW! this game also seems largely boring, all my friends regreted the buy so did I, 4/10 (Broken Laggy Mess with some funny moments) this is a personal opinion if you liked it, then im very happy for you but for me its very broken.
5323	0	a	To be honest this game offers nothing new. You're better off playing halo, or team fortress.
5324	0	a	A buggy mess of a halo ripoff that dosen't understand what it wants to be
5325	0	a	This garbage is worse than garbage.
5326	0	a	This is my first review ever. It's unfortunate it has to be a negative one. I installed this game when it was still 15$... Played it.... enjoyed it... 1 year later or so i reinstall it (today) and it wont run. Very upsetting seeing as how it is 79 cents now.. Dont feel like i am getting my moneys worth.  
5327	0	a	It....really is just poorly made. But it is what it is: a humans vs dinosaurs game, and it honestly is nothing else. Don't buy this expecting a solid experience: it's buggy, clunky, audibly empty, and not very pleasing to look at. It's a pre-early-access title, meaning it had the same principle of early access before early access was a thing on Steam. Don't buy it unless it's on sale for like, 99 cents, which often times happens with this game.  Fun fact: this game had a different title when I first bought it years ago, which really says something about its development.
5328	0	a	I seriously think the people who like this game have never played another coop shooter or something because the 'coop' is the only thing that could ever be considered fun about this garbage and no I don't think it's fun... Sure, I'd like to shoot dinos but this game is a joke.  Dislike: 1. Crap framerate yet the dinos are fast as balls half the time so theres nothing fun about shooting a speeding incomplete animation.   2. Buggy... don't get stuck  3. Guns aren't even fun to shoot. The pistal doesn't even have a shooting animation it just stiffly sits there making gun sounds.   4. I get that it's a buck and that's 'soooo cheap' but I feel like I wasted my money. If I buy games like Killing Floor on Steam for 2 bucks that are immediately great games then a buck for this broken, ugly, laggy, crap is way too much.   5. It seriously just sucks  Likes:  1. Jet pack was actually fun.    If shooting dinos with friends sounds fun to you it also did to me and I think this game is crap. If you want a truely good coop FPS with giant things to kill get the Serious Sam games. This game doesn't deserve your money.     
5329	0	a	Congratulations. This is the only game that I have ever seen to be the worst game of 2012, AND the worst game of 2015. They should get an award. 
5330	0	a	I have a crappy computer but this is very very slow.
5331	0	a	This game is a trainwreck
5332	0	a	Is it worth $.99? Sure. Is it worth your time? No
5333	0	a	I really wanted to play this game unfrotinately i get disconnected every time i try to join a server even when i get into one instant disconnect. i was looking foward to playing this but i made a mistake buying it.
5334	0	a	Was a really fun game untill they wigged with everything...
5335	0	a	Its as bad as the title suggests.
5336	0	a	ABsolute piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Would not recommend to my friends. This game is so glitchy and the gameplay is just absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's literally just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fest of awkward dinosaurs running towards you and you shooting them with you no recoil when hipfired gun. This is possibly one of THE WORST games of 2013/2014. Completely fix the glitches before you release the game. If there are a few glitches, I wouldn't mind. But there is one literally around every corner. Don't release a game that is still broken and is in progress. Even if it is on Earl Access or not. So yea. Enough of my rant. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. Fix your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Spend your money on something better. Like, Natural Selection 2. Or Maybe even a classic like Star Wars Battlefront 2. But seriously. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. 0/10 would not play again. Waste of money. Peace.
5337	0	a	would never recomend (no teamwork)
5338	0	a	Won't run very well on my mediocre computer. Put the visuals down as low as possible and it didn't help much. The game seems fun but I can't play it.
5339	0	a	really good but lagg to much idk why but its a really cool game to get on and play XD
5340	0	a	Cancer
5341	0	a	You really get what you pay for with this game.  The idea of shooting dinosaurs with future guns is a cool idea, I mean, its just plain bad-â™¥â™¥â™¥! But this game really falls short of expectations,   Graphically, its very nice. And on top of that, it not too hard on the computer. The framerate is smooth. Textures are quite appealing to the eye.   Combat is overly repeditve. About 10 minutes of play, i got bored fairly bored.   Its hard to get into the game's lore. Like seriously, with a few minutes of play, you have no idea as to whats going on. Here are some of my un-answered questions; Where are we? Earth? Some other planet with Dinosaurs? Who are we? Are we human? Are we an alien race? Why are there dinosaurs here? If we have futuristic weapons, and we are fighting dinosaurs, what time are we in? Like seriously, there is nooooooo story what so ever. You have no idea whats going on.  Athsteically, it REALLY needs some work. The its seems that the sounds in the game are SUPER repetitive. For the HUGE amount of weapons there are in the game, they all sound the same! The cars in it literally sound like the have 1 or 2 gears. after you start driving for a good minute, the vehical sounds cut and loop. Its HORRIBLE. There are No sounds for the game what so ever. I mean, there are no birds chirping, no wind blowing, no waves, no NOTHING. You can only here the sound of your own foot steps. That mixed with the GIANT maps that are completly EMPTY, the game feels more empty than fallout 3!   The animations for the dinosaurs, are just terrible. They move sooooooooooooooo fast, but the look like they arent moving at ALL.   The econemy of the game is horribly broken. You either always have TOO much money, or have no money at all. This works horrbilly witht the difficulty. On easy, the cash flow is so mondain. Killing one thing gives you â™¥â™¥â™¥-loads of money, so it makes it even easier because you have great guns. Then on medium or even hard, you never have money at all because you get little money, too many enemys, and you can never afford guns.   So far, its not the best game ive played. Ive heard that it used to be much, MUCH WORSE. But seriously, this is BETTER?  I strongly reqimend NOT to buy this game
5342	0	a	Not even worth $0.49
5343	0	a	This is an all around disappointing game. I spent $0.99 on it, and still got extremely depressed after playing it. ORION: Prelude is an FPS dinosour survival game, that focuses on simply shooting dinos before they eat you.   When I first entered the game, after playing five minutes, I knew it wasn't anything great- but at least at that point it was still worth spending one dollar to see what the game was like. Yet after each minute passed successively, it just got worse and worse. I realized that the graphics were pretty terrible, and that if you wanted to really obtain good gear, you would have to play for at least 30 hours, which I just wasn't willing to put into a crappy game that was not fun at all after 10 minutes.   Since then I've played a little more, only to realize that very few poeple play it, making it hard to find specific lobby of your choice.   ORION: Prelude is NOT at all worth the $0.99 it charges. It is disappointing and just plain stupid.
5344	0	a	Unless you enjoy playing endless rounds of killing dinosaurs...then I guess this game is here for a reason...but if not, as usual, then don't even bother to look into this game, even when its on sale for 99% off, becuase trust me...its still not even worth it...like seriously, I am still doubting myself of purchuring this game...I want my $0.99 back fow
5345	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT COSTS 0.99 $ BETTER BUY JETPACK JOYRIDE OR ANGRY BIRDS OR WHATEVER JUST DONT SUPPORT THE CRAPY WORK OF THE DEVELOPERS
5346	0	a	A good Idea with the Carnivores-meets-CoD concept (anybody old enough to rememeber WizardWorks' hunting games?); but it's just too buggy and unstable. It kept CTD'ing and the interface is also a little irritating. I deleted it litterally minutes after I DL'd it. Even though it is only US $.99 I'm glad I caught it on free weekend. Even 99 cents would feel like a sickening,terrible waste on such an unstable (and if you ask me, obsolescent looking) waste of 8 gb of storage.
5347	0	a	AWFUL it's total crap, maybe in 1995 would had seemed interesting now is outdated awful crap.
5348	0	a	It's pretty bad, unfinished and full of microtransactions (not pay to win, only cosmetic). Overall....it's free and I still didn't my money's worth.

5355	0	a	THank God its only 0.99$.....  do i have to say more??? The game has no direction....Just dont waste a single penny on this game....Graphics is not good enough...dinosaurs looks like its made of clays and crayons....Gameplay is aweful

5359	0	a	The game is a mediocre shooter, but the devs are the main reason I'm giving this game a negative review. I do not want to support developers that partake in asset theft. You can google the developer for more information, there is so much shady going on there.
5360	0	a	Fun for about 10 mins
5361	0	a	bad graphics, terrible audio and sounds wich give you a headache, badly optimized, massive frame drops, bad animations, bad models, etc, i dont recommend this game at all, the only good thing about this game is the ragdoll physics on the dinosaurs, nuff said
5362	0	a	Very laggy and slow. IDK if it's my computer or not.
5363	0	a	its not very good its on par with or slightly better than browser based games
5364	0	a	I saw the metascore of 36 but the game was on sale for a $1.50, so I figured I'd take a chance. Well, I gambled and lost. Let's just say that giving it a metascore of 36 is being extremely generous. It's an incredibly stupid and poorly-made game; I can't wait to un-install it.
5365	0	a	Just.. don't support them

5371	0	a	This game is only really worth it to play with friends. Even then its way too glitchy for my taste coupled with poor gameplay. I only put the number of hours I did because me and a friend turned the difficulty high up and laughed at the newer players getting slaughtered by an ocean of meat and teeth.  Would it be worth trying out? Maybe. But I would not recommend it unless you want to play a game with cartoon stupid enemy ai, cartoon bobble-head accessories seen on players, and a musical number that repeats itself so much that I have to listen to heavy metal to get it out of my head.  Oh yes and the Rex himself likes to throw giant boulders at you with his mouth
5372	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad
5373	0	a	The idea sounded cool, so I tried it. I really can't get into it. The voices were annoying and I feel like the graphics on some things (rocks, grass, trees) are on an overkill level and I had to manually turn the graphics settings down. The is a solo mode but it's not a story mode, it's just a play with bots mode which I found disappointing because being new to the game I had no idea what I was doing. The gameplay is choppy at best. Sound quality is horrible for a FPS. My surround sound is pointless for this game because it doesn't seem to use it. Also, I kept getting dropped from servers. I would love to see this game redone (again) with the Unreal engine.
5374	0	a	This game is not worth whatever it is put on sale for ever. Just not a fun shooter. If you want dinosaurs get primal carnage or dino d-day, anythingnother than this. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.

5385	0	a	Unlike the trailer said, the steam reviews are right. The only thing nice in this game are the art assets, pretty much everything else is garbage. You truly get the quality you're paying for.
5386	0	a	My friend got the four pack of this, we played for a few minutes, quit, never played again
5387	0	a	Firstly, all respect to the developers.  This is a game that started out bad. Like, really bad. One of those bad games you remember, yeah, you know the ones.  It's only that this time around the developers said 'Hey, we made the game, let's like, fix it and stuff.' Then they did. Then they added billions of loads worth of content. So much so they renamed the game about 2 (or 3) times based on how much they updated.  There are tons of maps, modes, weapons, and just variety in general that should make this game a jurassic clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of nonsensical fun. Why 'should' ? Because beyond all of what they have added, all of what they have continued to put into the game, I canno't for the life of me enjoy it.  Why? Well it's probably gonna seem stupid, but I personally think it makes a big difference.  Every single weapon is simply not enjoyable to use and makes the game feel boring and bleak.  Everything feels like a pop gun with the volume put to 2. I swear to god that sometimes the guns make literally no noise at all. They designed these huge awesome looking assortments of weapons, but they all feel so static and weak it's a joke, and aside from that there is very little feeling of actual impact when shooting anything.  This is seriously a big problem that hinders the entire game unenjoyable, or at least for me. I mean come on, this is supposed to be a giant battle for survival against huge, glorious dinosaurs, but there is nothing-- NOTHING about doing anything in this game that's at all fun to do.  This should be so easy to fix, and I hope to christ they make an update to the game that completly reworks weapon animations, sounds, and effects, because as of now it's loads more satisfying to fling rubber bands at a picture of Jeff Goldblum.  Also the occasional heavy lag and frame drops don't exactly help out.   Is the game worth a doller? Well to you and some others it might be, but there is nothing here that can bring me back unless they just update the guns to make them feel like actual, powerful guns.
5388	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad

But thats not all, if i put it down to 720p on low settings i get a beloved 2fps more! Dunno if its my 860m gfx card thats the fault or something else on my pc, or is it just the game itself :/ Because of those problems, i didnt test the game fairly good :P Defineitly (or hau dafuq is it spelled) recommened dis game if u wanna get a pair of glasses, but ur eyes are perfect and ur mom says u dont need dem!
5400	0	a	Things I didnt like about the game:  Played for the trading cards, which are dirt poor in value. No anime No anime â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ No anime butts No anime   -Gibus Sniper
5401	0	a	The graphics are nice (thanks to Unreal Engine) and it's fun for a while, but the game is very buggy, the maps are too big, you have to travel way too far to buy upgrades and weapons, and it get's very repetitive pretty quickly. The only way I'd actually recommend it is if it's cheap, especially since it has lots of in-app purchases and seems like it should be a free to play game. I don't regret buying it since I got it cheap but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're really into dinosaurs.
5402	0	a	this game sucks it lags way to much
5403	0	a	Not worth at any price. Steam service is horrid anyway.
5404	0	a	yeah, bought a full game several years ago and now i have a f2p moneygrab game instead that doesn't even show up in my libary anymore! i call this a huge scam and a facekick for everyone who ever spent their money on that game!!! i demand a compensation other than some ingame crap i can't even access for this -.-'
5405	0	a	This was a very quick review, because there doesn't seem to be a lot to the content. This game feels like an arena-styled, Jurassic Park meets Quake. You encounter waves of Dinosaurs, which get progressively more difficult. Killing these waves and surviving earns you points, which can then be spent to purchase new weapons and upgrades. Large Dinosaurs appear which you can fight and then assist in the capture of as side objectives for additional points. The game has a solo option where you have computer controlled NPC's assisting you as a team, or a multiplayer version where you can battle in a group. The graphics are slightly below average for games coming out today, the map board isn't very large and the game is very repetitive. Unless this is your cuppa java, I don't know if you would like it. I prefer better graphics, some kind of storyline, and less repetitiveness, but this game is more about Dinosaur Body Count. I wouldn't recommend it.
5406	0	a	There's a magic potion you can buy, that makes you forget you ever played ORION: Predule it's called bleach
5407	0	a	Making this free2play is a problem
5408	0	a	Oh god... at first I thought I was going to be able to write some hilarious review about how it was the best Dinosaur Survival Simulator of all time... but it's not.   To be quite blunt with you all, this is the worst game I have played in my entire life. And I have played a lot of games. This game takes the cake for being the most worthless piece of garbage that I have ever had the misfortune of wasting time on. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL TO FIGHT DINOSAURS - I REALLY DID! But once I started playing, I realized that it just was not going to work.  I was able to make it through the first wave of a survival match, and after shooting down 8 velociraptors, I realized that this was not the game for me; or rather, this was not the game for anyone. Anyone who tells you this game is decent is a child with absolutely no experience with any other games, because I'm pretty sure this deserves the title of not only Worst Game of the Year, but Worst Game of the Decade. The only thing I was impressed by was how bad it was...  Graphics: 0/10 Gameplay: 0/10 Sound: 0/10 Fun: 0/10 Premise: 10/10  0/10 Would not reccommend to a friend.
5409	0	a	YOU KNOW A GAME'S BAD WHEN THEY TRY STEALING CONTENT FROM CALL OF DUTY
5410	0	a	Not worth a dollar. These people have ripped off other companies assets and are going to get a Dino Beat Down soon enough.
5411	0	a	So this game was earlier known as ORION: Dino Beatdown and ORION: Dino Horde, but it's not mentioned anywhere in store page and haven't exactly found any other reason for that than making it harder to find bad reviews. Thankfully I only spend under euro, but I already knew that I disliked Dino Horde and as game wasn't expensive I just bought it before realising this.   To summarize: even though it has every desireable PC options included thanks to Unreal 3, it's pretty unoptimized and looks hideous. I can't count how many times dino spawned right in front of me even when I haven't played that long, guns look, sound and feel really powerless toys, menus and hud feel like mess, filled one game with bot player and they are simply brainless and coop doesn't even seem to matter as long as you simply shoot even more brainless dinos.   Only thing making it worthwhile is price at this point, but I still wouldn't buy it. They should've just let this thing die ages ago instead of trying to rename it every week.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Eli tÃ¤tÃ¤ peliÃ¤ on aiemmin myyty nimillÃ¤ ORION: Dino Beatdown ja ORION: Dino Horde, mutta sitÃ¤pÃ¤ ei mainitakaan kauppasivulla enkÃ¤ ole ainakaan itse lÃ¶ytÃ¤nyt tÃ¤lle mitÃ¤Ã¤n parempaa syytÃ¤ kuin tehdÃ¤ huonojen arvostelujen lÃ¶ytÃ¤misestÃ¤ vaikeampaa.

5412	0	a	not even worth 99p its the worst game that i have  
5413	0	a	I think this is one of the worst piece of sh*t games i have ever payed for i want my .79 cents back. The graphics are horrible, the game is a laggy piece of trash. 0/10 War Z is better-IGN
5414	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde (DH) is an updated version of Dino Beatdown (DB) despite what many users claim.  Originally copies of DB were retitled as DH after an update, claiming that they are different games is similar to claiming that TF2 became a new game after they added item updates.  Onto the review.  Dinosaurs + Sci-Fi soldiers + Coop + Giant maps should equal unmitigated fun, yet DH doesn't seem to rise above tediousness, for the longest time you could connect to servers despite opening ports, stable connections or close proximity.  I will say that I have not played this game recently, and maybe the game has changed for the better but given my past experience I am not compelled to try it again any time soon.  Check other reviews who have played the game lately.

5416	0	a	its worth 1$ thats about it.. crappy sounds... crappy play.. crappy gfx and crappy controls.. but for 1$ its okay.
5417	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played. Even at 99 cents, it is a waste of your money and time. In fact, I wish I could pay 99 cents to remove it from my Steam account.  Edit: I have since asked Steam Support to remove it from my account. Goodbye forever, Orion.
5418	0	a	I can't run it in offline mode steam!!!!
5419	0	a	Not even worth the download on a free week. They somehow cloned Halo with dinosaurs but yet still managed to make it suck somehow.  It's almost not even possible to do and yet somehow Spiral managed to screw up the marriage of Halo and Dinosaurs even worse than the way 800 North screwed up Nazi's and Dinosaurs.(Dino-D-Day)  So now begs the question......will Dinosaurs ever kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ in video games ever again?
5420	0	a	I promoted this developer and their games for quite a while, including buying several copies for friends. In light of their years of employee abuse and stolen assets, coupled with their playing the victim card each time, I can no longer recommend this company or their games. Considering how much information is available, and not knowing what sources you personally trust, I recommend googling 'ORION stolen assets' or 'ORION employee abuse' and deciding for yourself which side you believe.
5421	0	a	The developer is a scumbag
5422	0	a	The Land Before Time Game is not that great without the original voice actors
5423	0	a	Do like Dinosaurs, Jet Packs, Mechs, Tanks, and all sorts of other cool accessories? You do? Well guess what? Orion has all of that! But Is it any fun? No, It's not fun at all. The idea of blasting down Dinosaurs with you're pals is a great idea, It really is. However, It's prestented poorly with this game.    GAMEPLAY
5424	0	a	it's cheap and it feels cheaper
5425	0	a	usedto be great when it had a diff title now the ai is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the graphics are complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. and i paid 15 euros for this game while this is a 0,00$ version like i would be ashamed if i asked money for such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. gg dev team ope u hadfun with ur trolls please return this to the previous title STILL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5426	0	a	Today's Review: Orion: Prelude (Formally Orion: Dino Horde)  Let me tell you a story about a bunch of 'developers' that thought that would be a great idea to launch an indie game, poorly optimized (i'll say not even tried), multiplayer game with dinosaurs and guns (FPS) and how they fail at the point they had to drop permanently the price from 9.99 to 0.99 due the fact that no one will ever buy this crap or accept it for free, because they game sucks in every posible way, and i've played the slaughtering grounds, ride to hell retribution, RAMBO and other crappy games and this one it's the worst one, but hell, they reach steam without even passing trought greenlight so, there.  I'm not even gonna put a score to this crap, stay away from it!
5427	0	a	It's pretty bad
5428	0	a	American Servers only. So pretty much sucks for the whole world unless you can deal with 300+ ping
5429	0	a	I bought this game when it used to be called Orion Dino Beat Down, it is hands down the worst purchase I've made on steam. If only steam had their new refund policy back when I bought this game I wouldn't have this horrible piece of trash sitting in my library today =(
5430	0	a	dont buy that game, just dont. bugs like hell, flat storyline and gameplay. just dont buy it!!!
5431	0	a	the joke sale of the day -10% on 89 cents of total 'value' they say once they did a CONSTANT 90% off on the game.. in hopes it will get people to actually play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5432	0	a	What you would expect from a cheap game. Buggy but simple fun. I would only recommend this game if you and a couple of friends just wanted something to goof around on and not take seriously.
5433	0	a	Don't waste your money on this one, the devs went over to another title... again.  We will probably see more re-releases of this game in the future.    
5434	0	a	Don't waste your money on this one, the devs went over to another title... again.  We will probably see more re-releases of this game in the future.    
5435	0	a	Empty servers. Boting gameplay. This game must be Free to play, cause i dont want to pay for... this...
5436	0	a	This is probably the worst fps i have ever played
5437	0	a	This game is bad and I mean BAD. The dinosaurs are either know where you are they act stupid. It seems that they attack with the force because when raptors hit the arms don't move. The dinosaurs are just plain out OP.
5438	0	a	this game is very laggy
5439	0	a	Like skyrim but without a development team.
5440	0	a	This may be the literal worst thing on steam. I think it's definitely a contender at the very least.
5441	0	a	Everytime I shoot my, gun is delayed, but it did cost me just one buck. I wish I had never played (this crap), but I can't be bothered to give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (because it did cost only one buck. Still not worth it)  Just in case you wondered, this was an 'alternate rhyme scheme'. (ABAB)
5442	0	a	Ok, i know i haven't even played this game for 30 minutes, even 10 minutes. But here me out anyone looking at this review; the SECOND i got on, i thought this game was GREAT, but it turns out that the loading/menu screens were sexy looking.. When i got into a game and tried to connect; BAM, i lost connection. I tried 12 unsucessful times to get into a game and FINALLY got into one on my 13th try. The second i get into it, what does it say? 'Lost connection to host/failed to maintain connection' so i go back and i try again :P  When i DO finally manage to get into a game, the graphics were poor, the controls were CLEARLY meant for an Xbox 360 controller, NOT a console, and i could barely move around or anything due to that fact. And when i saw the Dinos i nearly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a brick -_-  They were awkward looking things, albeit their obvious attempted graphical enhancements.. so no, i won't recommend this game even though it was 1$  This game HAD good potential back when it came out awhile ago, now, however; it doesn't which is sad to say.  but HEY! who am i to tell people what to do/not to do? Go on and buy the game, try it out for yourself! But this is just my recommendation to NOT play the game. :) enjoy -_-
5443	0	a	I do like that this game is in the regard that it is updated often and it displays that the developers care for the game and want to promote the game as they update it. Though, I was still disappointed with the game even with the being updated so often. The game play is like many shooters but with sub par controls and broken game play. With the teamwork being the most important in the game but even with skilled human players, they dinosaurs have the advantage most of the time. Maybe in the future this game will be satisfying.
5444	0	a	Noooope.  Do not buy, horribly optimized, EXTREMELY bad gunplay that makes nerf guns feel like weapons of mass destruction. Animations are laughable and it's massively boring. I saw the reviews here and thought it might've changed - it hasn't. It's still as appalling as when I first saw it on a TotalHalibut/Biscuit video, and it feels exactly the same as it looked - and it was shoddy.  Even for 99p, which was how much it was on sale... no, don't get it. It's depressingly bland, boring and has such a bad feel to it, and it'll make you ashamed to see it on your steam library.  
5445	0	a	if you review this game saying '39 cents lmao' you definitely should consider suicide because nobody above the age of twelve finds the meme funny
5446	0	a	I killed a few mindless dinos while some Australian man yelled at me. Also, the gunshot sounds didn't sync with the animation. Would not play again.
5447	0	a	One of the only games on steam that is not even worth a single dollar.
5448	0	a	I'm glad i tried before i buyed, the game is only $1 on special and i wont even pay that. It may say single player but there is no real single player story. It's just you in a multiplayer map. I lasted for around 10-15 mins before i got too bored to play.
5449	0	a	  I'd rather get stabbed with a Jagdkommando tridagger than recieve this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as a gift.
5450	0	a	I thought this game was going to be good because who doesnt want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥??? Well no not at all this game is really boring and I wouldnt waste another second on it. This review is trash but I don't feel like listing everything wrong with this game because it would take me an hour
5451	0	a	Now that it is free for a week you should definitely try it out. Afterwards, you can safely claim you have played the worst game ever created in the history of mankind. Jesus F**king Christ, this is absolutely garbage. Giving this game a 1/10 should be considered too much praise.
5452	0	a	I paid for the game and its now free. watta â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ move.
5453	0	a	This game just downright sucks. For someone who likes to play dinosaur games this one isn't even trying just another survive the wave game nothing special. Just buy primal carnage extincion you get more worth outta your moneys then this game. But why do i hate this game? It's not even something only just a game with ''skins'' ''classes'' and ''different'' dinosaurs same colours, Graphics aren't even being updated. This ''game'' just needs to be stopped.
5454	0	a	makes you buy 5 dollars in funds to get a dollar game wtf?
5455	0	a	THIS GAME OMFG!!! THIS GAME FORCED ME TO MOVE MY HAND ON MY MOUSE AND CLICK BUY! IT COST ME Â£0.79 WHICH IS NOW GONE FROM MY ACCOUNT AND THAT IS Â£0.79 I WILL NEVER RECOVER! THERE IS A CHEESEY VOICE TELLING ME '2 DINOSAOWERS RIMEIN SNIKGDHM' HONESTLY... COULD THEY NOT AFFORD MORGAN FREEMAN TO VOICE OVER THIS. AND FINALLY, WHERE THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IS HARAMBE??!!! WOULD NOT RECCOMEND TO A GORILLA FRIEND.  I R8 -8/8 WHILST I FINGR MY PROST8.                              JUST A PRANK HAD Â£0.79 SPARE..........    STILL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5456	0	a	ummm... uuhhh... why this game become F2P? ._.
5457	0	a	Don't believe what the others say. It is not a good game. I promise you. It is okay, but seriously, pick up Killing Floor instead.
5458	0	a	Good game, but the problem can hurt each time you starting ERROR.  Personally: I really like, I am very pleased with it.
5459	0	a	only had a few quick games but so far nothing to shout about, gaming seems boring and dull. The only apspect that impressed me was the size of the dinosaurs..some are MASSIVE. one to avoid for me personally.
5460	0	a	its good but a lil bit not ... you know the graphics and the movement try it your self and you will see
5461	0	a	Maby a yes if you didnt steal.
5462	0	a	I only have ~40 minutes logged on this game - make of that what you will, but rest assured that I don't want to log any more time on it. Good premise, could have been fun, but the priorities are ALL wrong - a very pretty frag-fest with no atmosphere and nothing to hold the game together except scoring points. Dinosaurs don't behave convincingly, the maps are tiny, and despite having 4 Gb of ram and 1 Gb dedicated Vram the game doesn't run all that smoothly even with nerfed graphics settings. I picked this game up for 79p in a sale - I suppose it was vaguely worth that, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone at all. It's a poorly implemented set of bad decisions with no polish - they've left the fecking xbox botton markers in the menus FFS!
5463	0	a	This game has some serious performance problems, to a laughable extent. Dinosaurs will float across the place and your gun can't really even move when you shoot it. Might be fun if you like buying games that are funny because they are bad.
5464	0	a	I can't play the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game without barfing everywhere.
5465	0	a	buyed this game to play with my friends in other country, but it is not possible to connect to oversea servers. and my freinds cant also not connect when i open a sever in europe. okay, it was just 1â‚¬âŒ‚ ....but a wasted â‚¬.
5466	0	a	This game is completely reprehensible filth. Even the low price tag cannot justify this 'game'. I bought two copies, one for me and my friend. We played for a while and had many technical difficulties. Let it be noted that we do not have poor computers or low specs. He was experiencing lag for a lack of a compatability pack that wasn't installed with the core download. It gave no notice that it would cause issues and no method of installing it after.   The gameplay was abhorent. I've played Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, and it was significantly more complete than this. I literally could not find an aspect of gameplay that was complete or satisfying. The dinosaurs AI is dumber than a stump, and their animations are just repeatedly walking into you while your screen has a violent red seizure. The graphical fidelity is not present. These visuals aren't bad necessarrily, there just isn't any style or charm. They're similar to the Call Of Duty graphics. Bland. There was no impact from the gunfire and shooting guns seemed to be problematic. A core element of the game was not even functional. The vehicles are awful. It's similar to driving a ghost from Halo without any physics. The sounds were generic, similar to stock sounds you can find online or on YouTube. The music wasn't even something I acknowledged was present. It's bland. The game modes are just sitting there and fighting bland generic raptors. There is no exploration, there is nothing interesting. You stand there, shoot raptors and then die. The servers are dead empty for a reason.   DO NOT BUY  This is the WORST game I have ever paid for on Steam. Thank god for refunds.
5467	0	a	Game contains stolen assets and is run by greedy devs, not worth giving them any money.
5468	0	a	Devs should've stopped 3 years ago. They were right, this game was terrible. Not worth $0.50.
5469	0	a	Pings were so high!

5478	0	a	Bought it for 39 cents. Tried out refund policy. Got 39 cents back. No fireworks i didnt like it much :/ But what to expect from such cheap game + when i saw microtransactions it lost all of its chances.
5479	0	a	If this game was a cheeseburger it would be a rotten cheeseburger.
5480	0	a	GIVE ME MY FREINDS MONEY BACK!! He sucks at the game.
5481	0	a	Horribly Optimized Game That Looks Like It Was Made In 2003
5482	0	a	Whenever I talk about this beautifully crafted game I get emotional. It's just so wonderful and everything I've ever wanted in a video game. Huge alligators. Unrealistic dinosaurs. The amazing almost pixel like graphics. Wowza! This game is fantastic.
5483	0	a	This is a semi-good review.   it has great replayability but the core game needs some 'fixing up'   first of all if you look at the system requirements, you will notice that as soon as you start this game you will not be getting good FPS with the kind of computer it 'recommends'.  if they optimize this then I will give a better review.
5484	0	a	ORION: Dino Prelude Beatdown Horde is quite possibly the worst game I've ever played. And anyone who willingly spends money in this virus of a games microtransaction store needs to be sent to a Mental Institute and evaluated. Even though its priced less than a dollar, don't buy it, its a trap, what seems like a dumb joke becomes an immediate regret. Run, while you still can, and avoid this game at ALL costs.
5485	0	a	most lagiest game ever for any indians  ping is always reaching for the skyin INDIACANNOT PLAY LOCAL CO OP if any of you buyers live INDIA pls stay away from this game as far as possible
5486	0	a	this game isn't fun at all 3/10
5487	0	a	You know, I somewhat enjoyed this game. Cant really beat this kind of game for .99. I could rally a bunch of friends together and just go shoot dinosaurs. They didnt even have to have good computers. Just adequate ones and were on our way. I recently got my gf a gaming PC, and was going to get her this game.  I apparently had been living under a rock for the past year, as I had no idea the sequel was coming out back in December. I was excited. A better version of the .99 game that I had been playing with friends and loved ones. I decided I wanted to try and buy this game for her so that she could join in on the action. That is when I saw it. That is when I saw 'Mixed' for the recent reviews of this game, when it had generally been good. I had to check out what was up. I had to see what would make so many people badly review this game. Was there a game breaking patch? Nope. Worse.  After reading a myriad of reviews for the game from the recent fall, it became clear that this developer was not as wholesome as they would like to appear to the public. I dug into the recent debacle over the Activision DMCA, and what I saw was mortifying to say the least. A man, the owner of Trek Ind., playing victim and engaging social media wildly, starting far more fires than he could put out. To completely rip off guns from other games, and then blame the artist is shameless. Once is bad luck and I could see that being on the artist. But more than once and I no longer see coincidence. I see involvement. Either it was his idea, or they brought it too him and he gave the go ahead. Whats worse is that the artist likely cant even come forward with their side of the story as this a**hat has threatened to sue everyone for 'slandering' his good name with 'wild accusations'. Probably has some legal team ready to sue the moment he steps forward as they likely made him sign papers that would make him the fall guy in the very likely instance of this happening.  One things for certain: Trek Industries sure has earned a LOT of sheep. Reading through all of the posts defending this is aweful. Yes, Activision handled this poorly. But that DOES NOT excuse the owner of Trek Industies, or his handling of this matter. And then there is all of the other sketchy stuff this man has done... For instance: Funding your own indiegogo campaign to the goal just to get money from suckers. Sad. I dont know whats worse, the practice of this, or the suckers that fell for it.  So with all that said, I wish it wasnt too late to get a refund for this game. I will definitely not be buying the new Orion. And David, if you are reading this, please.... Please.... try to sue me for slander. It would make my day. You dont have a very good case becuase when you do stuff over the internet it is never forgotten
5488	0	a	unless this game has been updated its a huge garbage factory
5489	0	a	its the same game it was befor hense the 59 pence, if u have a very bad pc, and u can not get good fps on most of them games out there, this is for you. but for 59p (GBP) u can not complain, be sure to see this on andriod lol their last market
5490	0	a	my teamate was a complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idiot, pretty sure he was playing from the childrens hospital for being such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idiot WHO WOULD NOT REVIVE ME.
5491	0	a	tHIS GAME ISNT EVEN WORTH 1 DOLLAR!
5492	0	a	This is trash look at all the reviews no one can handle more than 10 hours of this crap on average i mean like really what did i expect from a $1 game all my friends said oh so good played 1 match they were saying how crap it was and cheaply made want a good game with dinosaurs get ARK survival evolved or something better atleast please don't fund the devs stupidity.
5493	0	a	If you really need to look at negative reviews for a 99 cent game you probably shouldnt be playing videogames.
5494	0	a	dis the worst gam eva
5495	0	a	It's like Ark but without everything that makes Ark a 10/10
5496	0	a	Jurassic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up by the devs what were you thinking you cheeky micebummers, ill have you know i once visited an eskimo reservation and they thought i was a god, to bad this game doesn't do the same amirte could've been the new civ 5 2/10 had some good times but never really did find out what happened to jacob degenerate 2 it was my favorite movie because when they fell out of the closet and samantha saw lucy with the gun i think i backwards exploded into the review section of blockbuster
5497	0	a	srly dont waste yout time on this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5498	0	a	After booting my potato machine, I decided to buy my friends this amazing looking game. No doubt, killing dinosaurs will be a blast. After waiting for 20 mins downloading the game we hopped in with high hopes. I will tell you right now, that the trailer is deceiving. The game runs at a solid (revolutionary) 20 frames per second. The game has a wonderful soundtrack if we could hear it without stuttering. What this game needs is to get out of the Dinosaur age technology and get optimized! (Also needs cheezus crust)   'This blows' - hanxshan 1/29

5503	0	a	Graphics poor. Really bad game. Barely any good gameservers aswell...    Don't kill dinos please for the sake of me   
5504	0	a	Not what i expected... But gj to the devs anyway
5505	0	a	My friend bought this for me. Thank God I didn't waste any money, because this is literally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Constant lag, horrible graphics and gameplay, and more combined to make a literal pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that came from the developer's â™¥â™¥â™¥. Oh wait, there was more than ONE developer? Jesus Christ, they must've gone and got the most autistic people they could find on the street, because this game sure seems like it.
5506	0	a	I cannot think of a more horrifying experience. I'd rather have militant terrorists penetrate my eye sockets than play this again. My neighbors all moved out of my neighborhood and the value of my house is degrading because of how severely awful this game is. An â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is more exciting than this game. This game is probably used in small African societies to scare small children into walking 40 miles to get a bucket of well water. It is easier to untangle 10 miles of braided steel cable than it is to enjoy this game. I would easily never recommend this to anyone. I do not understand why this game ever was accepted through steam green light, but it seems to me that whoever accepted it has a major mental deficiency. This game is so terrible that I don't even know if it is legal to make something on this level of scum. If I wrote anymore on this review, then I would be giving the game unnecessary attention that it clearly does not deserve.
5507	0	a	LIteraly good
5508	0	a	needs update and help graphics drains to much cpu and speed sucks need more charecters
5509	0	a	Would you like give away 99 cents to steam, thats basically what you are doing when you buy this game.
5510	0	a	this game gave me both testicular and breast cancer.
5511	0	a	I would rather eat a dollar bill than use one to purchase this game. The name of the game may change but the development time might as well been put elsewhere, and even for a dollar there are better games out there that will allow you to keep your friends and your dignity. My love for dinosaurs is officially as dead as they are.  Overall 9/10 some of the art is 'kay.  EDIT: The two friends I played this with are now lovers and refuse to speak to me.
5512	0	a	This game is honestly crap, the graphics suck, and so does the performance.
5513	0	a	Couldn't play properly don't have the pc best pc but should run well however it is so Laggy I can't tell what is going on going to try and get a refund not what I expected

5515	0	a	3/10 is just boring
5516	0	a	I rather buy a big mac.
5517	0	a	I found that this games graphics were lacking and the humans were underpowered and the dinos extremely overpowered also the weepons were very unbalanced
5518	0	a	This belongs in an arcade
5519	0	a	Absolutely horrible, don't buy this game at any cost... there is a reason it's price has been cut so much, they couldn't pay me to play this garbage. I could forgive a lot of things in it, the bugs, horrible graphics, and boring gameplay if it was a early access to a degree, but this is a FULL RELEASE. Avoid at all costs.
5520	0	a	Im not sure what to say.   I got it for 1 dollar yet I still feel a little ripped off  you can still try it I guess  Maybe I played too little because I couldn't find anyone who would play
5521	0	a	Horrible, horrible game.
5522	0	a	It seems good in the trailer, and it got a lot of good review but IT MOTHER â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SUCKS PINEAPPLE! Not even worth those 0,49 Euro. You will regret this!!!

5529	0	a	I want a refund, il take it in a ramen noodle pack or a can of coke
5530	0	a	Do not buy this utter piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5531	0	a	This game was Very Laggy okn my computer and it is a quallity one. Even with it at its lowest quality i still had some problems with it.
5532	0	a	It is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ F2P P2W game, except you pay money upfront. The gameplay is okay, but the lowest graphics settings can still be laggy on weaker machines. 2/10
5533	0	a	I bought this game two years ago and never played now I hear these mo'fo's are stealling from other devs yall some skeeving dirty little theifs! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME dont support trash.
5534	0	a	LOL so bad, avoid like the plague. I managed about 5mins in a game before I got so bored with not knowing what to do. Also the dino's don't even look good.
5535	0	a	wtf y u uninstal bish
5536	0	a	if you enjoy dinos this game is for you
5537	0	a	Dont support thieves. Unfortunately I did and I truelly regret it now...
5538	0	a	Paid money for this. liked the game.  check the price a few months later. Its free.  10/10 would pay 1$ again
5539	0	a	Pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Boring from the head start. Didn't even finish one single game.
5540	0	a	HUH this says single player. I booted it once and only saw multiplayer. I can't play multiplayer games. Whats the deal?
5541	0	a	Horrible
5542	0	a	had fun shooting each other until we found that the software is very glitchy and has issues in most of the multiplayer modes. Fun for the right price.
5543	0	a	well this game should be free it cost 72 cents? really? make it free plz
5544	0	a	very laggy even i use the recommended system
5545	0	a	I would not reccomend this game becasue the community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I say this from only needing to play 1 hour of the game. It is basically just a race to get the cheapest vehical and run over the enemy team with it before they do it to you. This game had a great idea however and was fun for the one time it that people didn't just run over the enemy team. If the games community was better I would reccomend this game however.

5580	0	a	Hello, today I am here to write a review for the game - Orion: Prelude. Let me start by saying this game is absolutely terd awful, and I don't think anyone should have ever even tried it let alone it get to over 1 million copies sold. I have played this game for some time with my friends and after being avid fans of killing floor this seemed like a complete rip off. But with aspects from other games like borderlands and it's second wind. I think this game is poop and everyone should know im only writing this review for a steam badge. Thank you.

5585	0	a	UPDATE ON MY YEARLY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME REVIEW   Shock in the gaming community as the developers of ORION once again caught Stealing assets from other games
5586	0	a	I've played this game, and it's alright, but nothing special. It's missing a lot of polish. I was hoping to play the newer one, but after learning that the company ripped off assets from other games and then LIED about it (seriously, just say your models were inspired by theirs. That's at least partially believable), I have no desire to support this company any longer, and I wouldn't recommend buying anything from them.
5587	0	a	I purchased this and was gifted ORION project and at first thought Activisions DMCA takedown was unfair, since then I understand that the asset theft is fairly clear and this is the shadiest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a game developer I've seen, the game has been renamed multiple times to avoid negative reviews on steam (Previously ORION: Dino Beatdown and ORION: Dino Horde) as well as a complete rename of the developer and publisher in an attempt to avoid other DMCA takedowns, do not buy any ORION game, it really isn't worth supporting

5597	0	a	I don't even own this game lmao
5598	0	a	The game's a shoddy Halo clone with goofy dinosaurs. Didn't have fun with it when it was new, but your mileage may vary.  However, the developers of this game are shady hacks. They've done multiple re-releases of this game in the past, in order to bury the earlier iteration's extremely poor reviews. They dropped the price to a hilariously low 99 cents [or less during a sale] so they can take advantage of people thinking, 'This game's super cheap, I won't lose anything if I buy it'. They've stolen assets from other developers on several occasions, such as an armory model from the game Natural Selection 2.  As further proof of this second point, another identical halo/dino game by them simply titled 'Orion' was recently removed by Steam as of the writing of this. They ripped a *fictional* sci fi gun model [a very different scenario than if they stole a modern-day, real gun] out of one of Activision's newer CoD games and shamelessly used it as their own. I don't normally side with Activision, but I really wish more big companies could strong-arm these scumbags out of the industry.  Having paid the original price for this game when it originally released as Orion: Dino Beatdown, which was 20 bucks, and of course long before the days of steam refunds, my regret for buying this piece of garbage will never cease haunting me.  Don't buy this. Don't support these devs with this game or any other game they make. Let it all die.

It does not have a quick match!  In all only mulitplayer games, there servers are poor, there's no configures like Passward Only, or Not Full Games. Hunting down a game is stupidly hard, heres a game! NOPE! it's full.  The actual game play: If you are a starter player, then you will be kicked out of games.... a lot  Heres an example.  SNIPER! SNIPER SPOTTED! GRAB THAT SNIPER! LOOK OUT! SNIPER!  'You have been kicked from Server'  what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥?...   The game play part plays like Call of duty/Halo mixed.  And they only got 2 game modes Team elimation. Horde.  Which are boring because Team Eliminate only is 10 players, and you will die alot because of the leveling system is out of wack. and Horde, it just a tower defence but with Dinosaurs, and you'll be kicked out all the time.  -1/10

5614	0	a	Worst game ever. You stand around and defend a tiny base from hoards of mobs running in. No time to enjoy anything. Once you've done it once, nothing is different the next time. Throw it away and never play it again. Best dolla eva! This game is always on sale for 90% off $10, making it $1.   The only thing anyone likes about this game is that it was a dollar. Thats as bad as saying that it made you happy to give a dollar to everyone at the mall one day. Actually, that does sound like fun! But maybe a better analogy is that its like paying to go into DisneyLand, but instead of riding the fun rides... you start handing out a dollar to everyone. No one says no to your dollar, but no one really appreciates your dollar either, except the young children... who think your dollar is the best thing ever.  You know another anology? This game being a dollar on Steam, where you can get actual good games that are also on sale for $5, is like standing in line for half an hour to get a snow cone, then realizing your snow cone tastes bad and spilling it on the ground. The End.  Other things that last longer than this game, that are also a dollar? 2 snickers bars. a movie at the dollar theatre. a large drink at McDonalds. a can of spray paint. 4 cokes out of a 12 pack. a pack of mini flashlights. a box of paper clips. a rock that someone glued eyes on. your dignity.

PLus there is a cash shop! I dont recall the last time I saw a game I had to buy then have a cash shop to contend with.

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

This game has been released multiple times in order to wipe out all of the massively negative reviews in the past.

Don't support â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ business practices.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q77rg/psa_the_developers_behind_the_orion_project_have/

5673	0	a	Why do people keep supporting this developer. This is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. The developer is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ person. And they should not be able to sell a game ever again. Oh wait. But if anything negative happens towards them, they will just rename the game and/or their developing studio name and the casual audience will not even notice. This developer is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing scummy it isn't even funny anymore. It never really was. And the game isn't even good. Like Fez is a good game but this game is absolute garbage. Just buy Killing Floor.
5674	0	a	This just does not work, is not complete, may be labelled a tech demo or concept draft. Certainly it's not a game. May be jolly in 2014.
5675	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/  TL;DR: The developers have been stealing copyrighted content to put in there games, however, this is not the sole reason I am giving this game a negative review, the developers have also been trying to victimize themselves by trying to make a big social media backlash for the DMCAs, and threatens to 'take legal action' against anyone that 'spreads false information' about their situation...
5676	0	a	I bought this game as 'Orion: DIno Horde'. Now, the dev has re-released it under yet a new name, and before I got it the game was Orion:Dino Beatdown. The good: A wave based survival game you can play with friends co-op. The bad: Most of the vehicles seem lifted from Halo, the dev keeps pulling and re-uploading the game to make negative reviews vanish, and now for their latest game they wholesale lifted assets from other developers and got caught, and are throwing a fit. Avoid this game to now reward them for their behavior, avoid the dev. I regre that I cannot refund it at this time due to getting too many hours into it.

5700	0	a	What can I say... I couldn't pass on a game for 99 cents with screen shots like that!!! But alas, it was only false and high hopes. Personally, I really preffer to try to avoid knocking someones hard work (as I assume someone did at one point put some sort of effort into this at some point) and I wish I could think of something positive about this game but I just can't. Really, it is that bad, and the only thing that this game has working for it is the price on sale. Oh... that's it!!! That something positive I was looking for!!! You should buy it for the price! Just because you have 99 cents laying around that should be in some starving developers pocket! Or you could wait til its regular price and help that starving developer with their alimony payments too!  But seriously, I feel like I've waisted too much of my time (and life) on this game as it is. Which is where I'm coming from when I say that you'll have to trust me on this and donate that 99 cents to help all the neglected and abused dinosaurs of the world. For just the price of a cup of coffee, you too can help save a helpless dinosaur.  Oh, I just though of another positive... Hats! Yes, the game has hats! And best of all you can wear them... Virtually! Yes! In the game! ... Okay yes, hats are not that exciting but it might be you like things on your head! So lets summerize this...  You should buy this game if you:  -Are a Philanthropist for:  -Dinosaurs  -Game Developers or  -Are balding or is bald   -Likes things on you're head  -Likes virtual things on your virtual head more  -Don't need 99 cents or   -Missed the sale and  -Don't need $14.99

5714	0	a	I stopped playing and lost all interest after being forum perm banned because the devs think the steam forum is not a place to say things about a product in which and where it's hosted to directly download, Banned from the forum for Complaining about the disconnection issue at the end of the round  Disconnected from Host How annoying  Several threads   Really a Permanent ban from the forum well die in a fire. No wonder this game's not so popular.  If this game ever picks up the pace i would say they changed kiddie developers why did i bother with the 50cents in the first place all the signs were there to tell people this is not a good game.   I sincerely hope the person who banned me gets some form of cancer and dies because.
5715	0	a	ORION: Prelude  This game is fun enough, fairly basic but fun to spend some time shooting up dinos and whatnot. But the reason I don't recommend this game is due to the company actions and the CEO David Prassel.  The Trek Industries and the CEO David Prassel have lied and mislead customers multiple times, two instances being them trying to 'rename' the game in order to get a new MetaCritic score and get people to essentially pay twice for the same game, and the most recent being Trek Industries initiating a slander campaign against Activision. Previously, David Pressal has also treated employees with disrespect, firing them once they completed their work and before they were paid.  DO NOT SUPPORT THIS KIND OF DEVELOPER

5718	0	a	I believe beep is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. This game completely changed my life. I was going through some rough times and the 30 minutes I spent on Beep changed my life. This is the best game ever it stopped me from drinking the full 10 ounces of bleach in order to kill myself. The complex and emotional story had me in awe. The bonk engine made this game look like it was real life. The vibrant colors and effects makes this game look on par with games like Battlefield One. If you do not already have this game buy it RIGHT NOW.
5719	0	a	Okayish game, horrible devs. Changing the name of their game, TWICE, to avoid bad metacritic scores. Stealing assets. Playing the victim after Activision calls them out on it and slaps them with a DMCA notice. Pretending to take the high ground by saying 'I won't retaliate against Activision' and then writing walls of text doing exactly that. Laying employees off after taking their work. Threatening to sue the 'kids' of reddit for all they're worth. Throwing a temper tantrum and saying 'OMG I WAS HACKED BY ANONYMOUS.' 'Flexible funding' on indiegogo and then funding the required $500 themselves. Deleting negative comments and anyone who disagrees with them the slightest. How anyone could continue to support him is beyond me. I'm returning these products immediately and I encourage everyone to do the same.
5720	0	a	I used to like this game, but with so much things going on with the company and CEO pretending to be victims of Activision's actions, while Activision have the truth, now I can not feel anything about this game but hate, this is disgusting. The game was fun, but now I can't just give my time to this disgusting Company.  Do not buy it, don't give your money to this **messed** up company.
5721	0	a	In light of the recent scandal.  The first rule of playing the victim is trying to make people sympathetic, being a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ doesn't help.

5723	0	a	As the game stands, it's not half bad for a $1 game, a lot better than most $1 games on the google play store. However this is not the google play store. In fact, i've seen better games on google play that are free. I honestly would recomend this is you're really bored and have $1 to blow on a semi-ok game. However the dev team, or whatever portion of them that wheren't fired so they wouldn't have to be paid for their work, have blatently stolen assets from other games. Honestly i hope the development team tries to drag out any possible future lawsuit between them and Activision so they go bankrupt from the legal fees and loose the hypotetical case

The first version didn't have several optimization issues but still had and lot of bugs. Dino games aren't very good too. I can't recommend this game, absolutely. Is too bad, just play a F2P game or do something else, don't waste your time with this.  Uninstalled and will never be installed again. OVERALL: This game is too bad. 2.5/10

5744	0	a	'Polished turd' is the best description i can come up with for this game. after playing it for a while, and doing some research, i honestly can't think of anything else. considering how long this game has been in the works, it looks like about three people spent their free weekends on it. it's overall quality is on par with PS1, but with slightly better graphics. if this was a free game on a site like New Grounds, i'd be impressed. after four or five years of 'professional' development, it's just sad.   The 93% discount plus the extended free trial smacks of desperation. or perhaps something more insidious? as though they are hoping you will get hooked, and become one of the rationalizing legion of followers feebley attempting to defend their poor choice.    not to mention all the controversy. but you'll have to look into that yourself.  P.S. I got a one week forum ban for 'If you can't say something nice...'

5773	0	a	My thread was deleted because I hurt the Steam Community's feelings but here's my review saying that the Steam Community voting this as a discount from 75 cents to 49 cents makes it the dumbest community on the internet:  The Steam Community voting this as a discount from 75 cents to 49 cents makes it the dumbest community on the internet. And I don't care what you have to say. Your opinion, unless it agrees with mine, is invalid based on the fact that you voted for a game to be 26 cents less. A game no one plays.

5797	0	a	It's not worth it
5798	0	a	It's on sale for .49 cents. That should tell you all you need to know without someone explaining it to you.
5799	0	a	Installed the game. Launched the Game. Walked out of base. Looked around and said nope.
5800	0	a	My computer couldn't handle this one sorry it seems cool tho
5801	0	a	i dont need to be rude but, i just didnt like the game, i prefer zombies then dinos.

5807	0	a	Its really fun. Recommended
5808	0	a	Ive have spent so much time on this game (as seen above) that its truly sad that im writing a bad review for it.  I understand it is a one dollar game but many free games like flash games and warframe top this game. The hard work and time ive put into this game could have been spent with family so the moral of this review is dont play this game for hours apon hours when it is a bad game, ive suffered so you dont have too......91039/12....would play again.....maybe......not.....definitely not....
5809	0	a	I payed $1 for this game then it became free
5810	0	a	Some games are quite simple, yet very enjoyable.That happens beacuse they surpass our expectations, proving to be more than just a simple game.In ORION:Dino Horde`s case, it`s the exact opposite: the games promisses too much and ridiculously fails at delivering it.Old looking graphics(not on purpose) , dumb A.I. and constant lagging and crashing problems make you wish someone more competent had developed this.No, the metacritic score is not so misleading as they say.
5811	0	a	This game gives the feeling that it was assembled out of models bought off of stock bmodel website. Gameplay is meh. UI is meh.   1/5
5812	0	a	...
5813	0	a	This game needs alot of work, feels clunky and unfinished. Would not recommend this to anyone.
5814	0	a	Played it once, uninstalled, no regrets.
5815	0	a	Its so freaking laggy i don't recommend it. I barely could move
5816	0	a	It feels like its missing a reason to play/continue playing other than to see how broken it feels.
5817	0	a	this game suckss i want my money backk
5818	0	a	When the T-Rex roars your ears will bleed, no matter your sound settings.  12/10
5819	0	a	It had dinosaurs. It was ok, just not great. Could use some more varying of weapons.
5820	0	a	other poeple may like this but i hate waiting half an hour just for about 3 minutes of little fun :/ 3/10
5821	0	a	If you're crappy and you know it, syntax error *glitch glitch*, If you're crappy and you know it, syntax error *bug bug*, If you're crappy and you know it, The Steam front will surely show it, If you're crappy and you know it, syntax error *pfft pfft*.
5822	0	a	This game should not have the single player tag. Game is not intuitive. I see a lot of weapons sitting there, but there is no key to pick them up. I will investigate the forums if I ever decide to try this game again.  There was a response to a question about playing solo in the forums:  'The short answer is: Yes.  You'll not be able to level up and unlock equipment, you won't get achievements, the game is much more fun to play with other people and more difficult to play alone.'
5823	0	a	Gameplay is nice. But they could make some imporvements.
5824	0	a	fun, but could be alot better
5825	0	a	Don't play this.
5826	0	a	Game might be fun but all I get are errors when trying to connect to a game...too early to say it's a waste...but don't really know how much more time to wait to play a game.
5827	0	a	Can't say I really enjoyed my time with it.
5828	0	a	i want my 49 cents back
5829	0	a	While there is nothing actually wrong with this game, there is just no reason why I would want to play it over left 4 dead, killing floor, or TF2's MVM. It's OK but if you're in the mood for horde killing there are better games out there.
5830	0	a	THIS GAME ISNT WORTH THE SECONDS OF YOUR LIFE TO DOWNLOAD IT.
5831	0	a	Keeps freezing tried everything but nothing works
5832	0	a	I played this game on a free weekend and still thought it was a waste of time. The game was just terribly set out, I have to run for 15 minutes to get to some random checkpoint and I wasn't sure why, the guns all feel similar, the dinosaurs don't even feel particularily fun to fight. You can get the game for less than 50p right now, and I'd say it still isn't worth it.
5833	0	a	More bugs than Goat Simulator
5834	0	a	I thought 'What the hell its 50 cents I can probably get an hour of fun out of it.' Boy was I wrong. I think that I'd get more enjoyment out of a 50 cent piece of bubble gum from the grocery store. It's that staggeringly bad. I decided to do a little research and found out that this game changes its name whenever reviews get bad.. Also, the only reason that it is as highly voted as it is is due to the fact that the developers spam the steam reviews with bots. Man this is just a pathetic excuse for a game. I don't even know where to start; so I won't... just trust me, you don't want this piece of sh*t anywhere near your computer. Go buy a piece of freaking bubble gum.
5835	0	a	You should not buy this game, your caracter is hard to controle, dinos are everywhere and moving too fast. This is not fun.
5836	0	a	Game is buggy, crashed and DCes during games. One crash caused me to lose my progress. Would not recomend.
5837	0	a	o you ever feel like slamming your face into the wall, whether due to frustration or any other reason? This is the game for you. Everyone should play this game. If not just to appreciate every other game you've ever played pretty much. Maybe you just spent a period of time witnessing idiocy to the extreme and feel like slamming your face into the desk. Perhaps you just came from the cesspools of the internet. Just play this game. Results may vary.
5838	0	a	the AI is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in this game
5839	0	a	Last time i played game i just entered in had no idea where to get weapons no guide at all it was rly messy no tutorials graphic sucked those pictures they show on fb community group are far from this game and will never be good.  All at all it not $0.something with no reason....
5840	0	a	The game is broken. 2 out of 3 times I tried opening this game it put me in a black screen, in which I could not alt+tab out of it. When I did get it to work it was impossible to join a friend's game lobby, since either it could not be found, or when I could find it and joined the lobby it put me in a blank screen. Not even worth $.50.
5841	0	a	If you have 50 cents, buy this game. If you don't give this game a good review the devs will re-release and change the name.
5842	0	a	If you have a few hours to waste and $1 to spare, its ok. If it wasn't so cheap I'd say its a waste of time, sell some cards and buy this is you absolutely have to, otherwise don't bother.
5843	0	a	Worst shooting I've ever tried out in gaming.
5844	0	a	It's fun for a bit but missing some content.
5845	0	a	worst game ever lol
5846	0	a	Good and fun game, after a while it gets boring though.
5847	0	a	This is one of the only Steam games i own that i wouldnt reccommend buying. When I first bought it, I was super excited, but whem i lunched the game, I found that the graphics were terrible (and slow), and that the overall idea of the game was kinda stupid too. Some people might enjoy it, but it certainly wasn't for me.
5848	0	a	It's so glitchy and unoptimized. I wouldn't bother purchasing it.
5849	0	a	zero skill involved in the game. Guns have zero recoil which shooting a bore. Fun concept but bad execution
5850	0	a	Whats the objective? what are the controls? lets find out *mashes all the buttons one by one*
5851	0	a	you get what you pay for. The game is about as confusing to play as if I were making the game myself. That being said, it does have potential. BUT, if the developers do not clean the game up it's going to just be Call of Duty with dinosaurs. with just as many 'spinoffs' if the rumors are correct.
5852	0	a	The game is on the verge of being likable which is what makes it worse.
5853	0	a	Wow this game is bad..... 
5854	0	a	Claims to have full controller support, does NOT SUPPORT XBOX ONE CONTROLLER. This type of game NEEDS controller support. Please remove your head from â™¥â™¥â™¥.    0/10 (unplayable without claimed controller support)
5855	0	a	by far the worst halo simulator ive ever seen. i mean my god! it violated me. it lured me inside with the promise of eye candy, why, just why!  (only took a few minutes to realise it was just awful)
5856	0	a	Cool concept could be better
5857	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN FOR 99 CENTS IT IS BAD IT WILL MAKE YOU HAVE FAT CHODE
5858	0	a	A terrible shooter that not even dinosaurs could save.
5859	0	a	Only play this if you have a good computer. Please look at minumim requirements for your computer and if you can run it. It was so laggy for me.
5860	0	a	Worst game ever. Like, NOTHING in this game works, except for the singleplayer. But that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ain't balanced AT ALL. 'Look at me! I've got a jetpack to fly places you can't hit me!' Assault-class all the way - eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Orion.
5861	0	a	I can't recommend this game, even though I got it for less than a dollar. True, I feel that I got my money's worth of enjoyment, but this game overdelivers on concept and far underdelivers on gameplay.
5862	0	a	I really wanted to love this game but the mouse delay was way to intense. Lag city â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lag lag city â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.... 4/10
5863	0	a	this game's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5864	0	a	Got the game from a friend tries to join lobby 3 times ends up playing with russians 10/10    not
5865	0	a	DONT BUY THIS DESPERATE PIECE OF CRAP  Notice how no actuall CRITICS leave messages in the trailer, that's because they got random users to say unbelievable crap about this decieving â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bucket of a game,  I know it's '99c' It doesnt mean you have to buy this game Just go buy a piece of paper, draw a dinosaur on it and you will have more fun doing so then you would playing this garbage
5866	0	a	I didn't get this game. Nice graphics though.
5867	0	a	Not good. Just not good. Don't buy it.
5868	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5869	0	a	Buggy, decent graphics, and repetitive gameplay lacking variety and weapons. The maps are dull and playing as a dinosaur isn't nearly as fun as it seems it would and probably should be. Also the controls for controlling a dinosaur are unclear, unstated, and a lot of the times do not even work. Not worth playing - it is a waste of time and not nearly as good as it should and could be.
5870	0	a	Still doesn't work. Waste of money. Steam should remove.
5871	0	a	Don't buy this is game is a troll
5872	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ITS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YA â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 3/3467890 POP A MOLLY UNLEASH SUPER-SAIYAN
5873	0	a	A nice concept, but fails on execution. So-so graphics, unbalanced gameplay, nothing to help you learn the game, empty servers and super repetitive music. Feels more like an alpha or beta rather than a finished game.
5874	0	a	This game is buggy, there are bugs such as doors remaining closed the whole game. The melee weapons are also useless as they are outmatched by the heavy weapons, such as the minigun. This game also has terrible graphics and the game has random lag spikes (the lag might just be my computer).
5875	0	a	Cheap game, so can't complain. It does feel like it was developed by some people who got bored midway and still decided to release it.
5876	0	a	It was fun before the 'Prelude' title came about. Now the game feels like a generic P2W / F2P title.
5877	0	a	Dinosaurs? More like DinoSORES! Hah! This game is terrible. Just awful. If you play this game, you're scum. If you made this game, you're scum.
5878	0	a	Shoot Dinosaurs as they skate towards you.
5879	0	a	I wish i could sell games on the steam market...
5880	0	a	Seems like if turok and halo had a baby (the first or second halo of course, because the graphics, i think that i could even run it on my celeron). The blood is bad as s**t, but... it was 0.99â‚¬ and is the type of game you'll give for your girlfriend play when she on her period, she'll love it!
5881	0	a	I gave the game an honest shot, I really did. I just could not bring myself to liking it, it felt far too generic and shoddy. I can imagine the game being good fun for a couple of buddies on LAN but that's as far as I would go. Accounting everything from graphics, game mechanics and accessibility i'd give the game a 5/10.
5882	0	a	Also just 3 â‚¬ in the summer sale were too much for this game....
5883	0	a	I AM CHOKING ON THE QUALITY OF THIS GAME JK
5884	0	a	4/10 gets boring quickly i dont know how maybe the atmosphere of it. only get it if its on sale
5885	0	a	I tried this when it was free to play. It is just an awful game.
5886	0	a	This game blows. Trust me.
5887	0	a	well I got the game to try out and let me say I DO NOT LIKE IT. The grafics are slow and multiplayer is bad. Its not worth the mony, I rather recommend tf2 or dota 2 than this. But the game can get beter with updates and help so what im saying is put some work into it and I'll recommend it but not now.
5888	0	a	terrible, not even worth 1.99 or whatever it is
5889	0	a	Stupid and only fun for a short period of time.
5890	0	a	to play this game you need 2 things beer and lots of it and frineds that are willing to buy this game
5891	0	a	This game is pretty boring and has bad graphics, If it hadnt have been free to test, I wouldnt have played it... Im glad i didnt buy it.
5892	0	a	I bought this game for one euro.  Still felt robbed of my money.
5893	0	a	Let me just say there is a good reason that they only show off community reviews on the store page: every slightly educated video gamer knows this is a functionally bad game. The metacritic score is correct and should not be tampered, and no this isn't a different game than the Orion before it. While this game has many features, none of them work together in the slightest. It seems as though this is just a marketing scam for a garbage game that tries to attract every single 10-year-old shooter player. I played during a free weekend, and I can confidently say that I will never look at this title again. I wouldn't pay 5 cents for it.
5894	0	a	Graphics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The gameplay is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The sound makes me want to cry. The recoil on some of the weapons are trash. Even if it's only one dollar, I would rather have the 4 gumballs that could buy me.
5895	0	a	For some reason this game gets put on sale multiple times. If you're looking for a hilariously bad game to play with your friends, this is for you.
5896	0	a	Only good part of this game is buying a vehicle and racing your friends. The dinosaurs are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5897	0	a	I got this game for free and I only played for 15 minutes. What a waste. The graphics are awful, the animations are terrible, and the combat is a Halo ripoff. It's a really bad Halo ripoff with ugly dinosaurs. Avoid this game.  0/10
5898	0	a	I've only been able to play 2 games. Almost every time I try to join a game it crashes.
5899	0	a	I saw this game on sale for a buck and thought 'Why not?' I had fun with it, but that fun gets outshone by several problems with the game which I am surprised are still there for a game that was released over 2 years ago.  First off, the game. It's a game where you are set against hordes of dinosaurs, ranging from quick raptors that try to hunt in in groups, to triceratops that will charge at you, to T-Rexs which will just gobble you up. You have a variety of weapons to choose from: pistols, rifles, shotguns, explosives, and even a bow and sword. You can also hop in vehicles, such as trucks, tanks, and VTOLs. With three classes (a flying type, a medic type, and a cloaking type) you have ample options to wreck those dinos. Of course, there is the PvP modes as well, where you can play as the dinosaurs as well.  Before I start getting into the problems I had with it, let me say this: I did have fun. You can have a lot of fun with the game when it is working. My favorite loadout is jetpack, grenade launcher, and shotgun, with a little extra armor for good measure. I can tear through hordes of dinos while flying around like a fairy. It is also entertaining to have a jeep plow through the enemy while your buddy is shooting from the turret on the back. So yes, I had fun with the game.  However, I really can't recommend this game because of some glaring issues with it. 1. Connection issues. Connecting to server is iffy at best. Some times it will connect you to a game, and then instantly disconnect you. This happens quite a bit. Other times, you'll be midmatch, then be disconnected even though there was no indication of a bad connection. Sometimes lag will be horrendous. Players teleporting around your screen, and bullets seeming to vanish a foot in front of you. About 30% of my time had no issues. The other 70%, I was having trouble connecting, or getting dropped from a server. I've had several really good runs ruined by a random disconnect. It is extremely frustrating.  2. No tutorial. None whatsoever. It took me over an hour before I realized I had grenades(press g to throw). Also, you would think space would control the jetpack, but it's set to ctrl for some reason. You can melee, but again, you don't know that unless you hit it on accident, ask someone, or run accross it in the keybindings. It was even longer before I figured out how the augments system works(just an fyi, you can have an infinite number of augments equipped. You buy them by double-clicking. You can also buy an augment more than once for some reason. It doesn't boost you though, it just takes your credits). Altogether, there may be some fun stuff I am missing, but I don't know what those are because it isn't made obvious.  3. The graphics are all over the place. The dinosaurs look really good. The enviroments look all right. The player models just look horrible. Even when playing on high settings, they look blocky, or the texture messes up really badly. As for the weapons, some of them look really cool, such as the burst-fire rifle(I don't remember what it's called). Other weapons look extremely uninspired. The shotgun I like to use looks like a tube with some lights and wires. Also, a number of icons look extremely low resolution. They should really be polished up. The vehicles are all over the place in terms of style. Most have s silvery shine and lights, some are dark and grey, and the hoverbike looks like it is from a different game entirely with its turqoise paint.  4. Balance. The balance is odd at times. For example, a knife is pretty powerful, but the sword is pretty weak. That's a really weird decision, especially since it costs more credits to get the sword than the knife. Also, the grenade launcher is probably too powerful. I love to use it, and I am saying it is too much. I just wreck dinos with it, until I'm overflowing with credits I can't use. At times, my teammates are running low on funds because they can't really compete with a GL. Another weird decision is the turrets. I have only seen someone use one once because they only last 60 seconds, even though you most likely will not be able to afford one until wave 8/10. I don't know why you would pay 20,000 credits for one (the same price as some of the most powerful weapons in came), and people I have played with can't justify buying them either. Another issue I had was with the augments, one case in particular. There are two augments that affect jumping, one which increases your jump height(by a lot) and one which gives you double jump(which is unaffected by the previous augment). The jump height upgrade is flatout better than the double jump. There is a very noticable difference in heights you can reach between the two.  5. The shooting. For the most part, the guns feel pretty weak. They don't do a whole lot of damage, they don't sound powerful, and they can be extremely innacurate. Especially when you buy some of the more expensive guns, they don't do much damage to justify their cost. Sometimes, guns are innacurate for the weirdest of reasons. For example, the turret on the back of the car. If you look to the left or right with it and fire, the bullets will hit several feet to the left or right of where you aimed. I felt something was off when driving around with it, then tested it while stationary. Even while sitting still, if you aren't looking straight forward or backwards, it won't hit where you aim. I really don't understand why that is.   6. Bugs. Some of the bugs I have run into: -not spawning in a match. You are supposed to spawn when a new wave starts, but I've had several times where this had not worked. -in the player customizations screen, my character would not be centered on the screen. About half the time, my character model would be off to the side under the menus where I coulndn't seem him. -as mentioned before, you can buy augments more than once. I accidently bought an augment twice while playing, losing valuable credits. -in the keybindings, you can set vehicle steering to be either controlled by A and D, or by mouse. This doesn't work, it will always be controlled by mouse. I never got it to work. -sometimes, when reviving a teammate, the meter will disappear. You are still reviving them, you just can't see it, so don't stop holding E.  7. Just weird little quirks: -the tank has a second, smaller turret on top, similar to what is in the car, but it is still controlled by the driver. They could really make the tank a two-seater and give control of the secondary turret to him. -dinosaur spawning. We lost several vehicles because dinosaurs spawned on top of us while driving by. That really ruined the mood. -the flying dinosaurs(called Rhams according to the wikia) can turn on a dime. They'll fly at a player from above to try and hit him, but will stop and turn really quick, making them difficult to dodge, as well as being difficult to predict and shoot. -there is an indicator on your HUD showing you how many magazines you have left. However, the games doesn't use a magazine system. Ammo is just taken from your ammo pool and dumped into your gun.  So while it is fun at times, a lot of stuff can and does go wrong. If you can get it on sale, great, you'll find some entertainment with it. I got it for a dollar. But I cannot recommend paying 15 dollars on it, as well as spending real money for cosmetic items in the in-game shop.
5900	0	a	I was told by a friend that this game isn't that good and I didn't believe him. Till I played it on my own and it isn't that good at all. The gameplay just doesn't seem right, the first thing the enemies do is jusr charge at you no matter what. Even though they're dinosaurs. It doesn't seem to have a good plot to except to protect certain stuff and kill dinosaurs. The graphics are fine, but it doesn't make up for how I think of the game. I don't recommend this game. 5/10
5901	0	a	What a horrible and junk game
5902	0	a	As hopeful as i was for this game, it did not turn out so well.  Playability is 1/10 because once you find the groove you can easily win any game mode.  Graphics is decent 5/10  UI is about 6/10 but vastly could do for some maintance with some buggy area's.  Lobby and Server waits/connect is 2/10 because it seemed like the first two times booting up it didn't let me join or respond to click imput.  Overall 3/10 because it doesn't suck you in and has you replaying over and over. If you really want to try it out, wait for free trial periods then if you want to buy, get it on sale because 15 bucks is way to much for a sub par Killing Floor type game.
5903	0	a	It is a meh game. At first it is fun, but then it just becomes wave after wave of the same thing and it becomes boring. There is really only one good-ish game mode. I am glad that someone else got it for me at a 93% off promotion because it is not worth $15. I just can't reccommend this game. 4/10
5904	0	a	Alright for shooting some dinosaurs in the face, though the difficulty ramps up a little too quickly for my tastes. The assets are decent enough, but they suffer quite a bit in motion due to an odd application of motion blur.
5905	0	a	Awful game. Just terrible...
5906	0	a	36/100 Metacritic is too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing generous.
5907	0	a	Did not like the game, difficult to control, though I'm not a huge fan of FPS versus hordes
5908	0	a	This game may look fun however it is not. My friends and I played it and it was very boring and the graphics were really bad. Please don't even spend one dollar on this game its not worth it.
5909	0	a	It's fun for... less than the time it took me to download the game. Glitchy and un-fun.
5910	0	a	this game is so horrifly terrible. Not worth a quarter
5911	0	a	Garbage not worth the $1.49 I payed for it.
5912	0	a	this game is crap to play by yourself...maybe it would be fun with other people...
5913	0	a	Not worth the $1.50 i paid for it. Although it presents a decent concept, it feels unfinished with LOW 2d graphics on small dinosaurs and a lack of both game mode variety and gun textures.
5914	0	a	Although it was a decent effort, this game's mechanic are not the best. The game feels rather clunky and has a large time gap in between survival rounds. In addition, there is a lack of game mode variety available in this game. Due to this, my attention deviated from this game in less than an hour. In conclusion, I would not reccomend buying this game even though I got it for $1.49.
5915	0	a	i played it a little bit didnt really like it. i think it needs some more work
5916	0	a	If you ever wondered how virtual garbage may look like.. Just buy this game and your desire for knowledge will be satisfied.
5917	0	a	I bought this game when it was $0.99 and I want every cent back. It's borderline unplayable. I don't understand why this game has any positive reviews. I'm pretty sure my review will be deleted shortly. If you can see this, don't buy this unholy mess of a game.
5918	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.DO NOT BUY,WASTE OF MONEY,NEVER BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME,IT SUCKS,TETRIS IS BETTER THAN THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T.
5919	0	a	Absolutely horrible, I first had to trek 1 kilometer JUST TO GET TO THE FIGHT, and then the generator you were supposed to defend was out in the middle of a field IN FRONT OF THE FORT, as opposed to in the fort, where any sensible architect would have put it, and then when the dinos finally did begin appearing out of nowhere, I simply ran into them until they died on a tiny gravcycle, even the 'boss' was killed by a few hits with the completely undamaged gravcycle.
5920	0	a	it looks like it could be a fun game but the dino controls are kinda really bad
5921	0	a	Halo styled play with dino's. Meh.
5922	0	a	Microtransactions and a pricetag, it's fun, but not my cup of tea.
5923	0	a	Thank god I only lost $1.30 on this game. It's cheesy in all the wrong ways, so much so that only a 5 year old boy with devolpmental issues wouldn't find the cliches grating. 0/10  Even on the lowest settings the game is prone to crashing and hiccuping frequently. Too much time to jacking to leaf textures and not enough time actually putting some thought into the game. I wouldn't recommend this to even stalin.
5924	0	a	Horrible load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I got it for free when they were giving it away. Not even worth the price of free, it's like a really broken and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ version of Halo 1 with dinosaurs.
5925	0	a	The Source Engine would have been a better choice, doesnt make sense, poor aiming ability, promised big dinosaurs and big guns, world design :(
5926	0	a	A bad Halo knockoff with dinosaurs. Would've been nice to play humans vs dinosaurs with more than four people. 4 suicide bomber pterodactyls /10
5927	0	a	I got this game for .99 cents.. Its worth that much to be honest. Don't buy this game unless its dirt cheap.
5928	0	a	crappy game, boring bad graphix
5929	0	a	It's not often that I am left speechless, but today dear reader, I must cut off my voice and gaze upon the glory that is ORION Dino Horde in humbled silence. Truly a masterpiece, perfect in every way, the Citizen Kane of video games. Words cannot describe the joy and pleasure that result from engaging in this program. I must confess that I climaxed not once, not twice, but three times during my first session. If you only buy one game this year, if you buy only one game this century, if you buy only one game ever, I implore you, purchase this glorious piece of art and feel the warm glow of true satisfaction.
5930	0	a	It's not so surprising that this game doesn't have a lot of players. At first, the prospect of fighting with friends against hordes of dinosaurs sounds very fun and exciting. Unfortunately, it gets old really fast. The first game you play will probably be the most fun you have with Orion: Dino Horde and then afterwards the novelty wears off.   The game has a variety of multiplayer modes but only 2 or 3 that are actively played. Every game rewards you with EXP to increase your level but you don't recieve anything when you increase in level. The content that you experience at level 0 will be the same at the level cap. The game mode that has the most potential for fun is Rampage. Rampage is a Human vs Dinosaur game mode in which players are allowed to play as the dinosaurs alongside AI controlled dinosaurs. It's just unfortunate that right from the get go, the dinosaur team can play as any dinosaur. Right from the beginning of the match, all dinosaur players can select the strongest dinosaurs available like the T-Rex. But all of that is moot because the human team has the overwhelming advantage. Humans can, with upgraded jumps and jetpacks, reach the highest mountain and rain down hell on the dinosaur players. Most of the playable dinosaurs are land based and don't have the ability to jump. The T-Rex has a ranged attack, but with limited distance and a small hitbox. There are a few flying dinosaurs, but they are all too weak to do any considerable damage.  The balance issues between human and dinosaur are a result of all the maps being open environments with high peaks. A close quarters indoor environment reminiscient of Jurassic Park would have made for exciting matches and would give more opportunities to using some of the smaller dinosaurs and still be effective.  On to the graphics. One word? Meh. The maps are nice enough. Though they suffer from plain textures and too much bloom. Most times you won't even notice the art because there's really nothing to draw your eye to it. Dinosaur models are okay. But player models are just terrible. The low poly and muddy textured player models look like they've been copied from the original Tribes game. The graphics are not a good show of what the Unreal 3 engine can do.  Considering I bought the game on a sale, I can't complain, but this is not a well made game. It runs on the gimmick of fighting dinosaurs but ends up being boring and just genuinely not fun. I wouldn't recommend it.
5931	0	a	I DON'T LIKE POLONIZE
5932	0	a	Don't believe the hype! This game is still as crappy as ever. Even free, I regret that I even wasted the hard drive space on it. I normally don't write such scathing reviews, especially about indie titles because I loves me some indie development, but honestly, nothing good to say about this title.   Models = crap level design = uninspired crap skins = crap dinosaurs = unplayable crap Sound desgin = stock crap  This title is best relegated to the dustbin of Steamdom.
5933	0	a	Cheap yes but lag ugh so much of it....If you want to play for 30mins than get bored than this is the game for you someone made this in a day just to steal your money dont buy unless you love games that you get stuck or people camp where you cant get them its like really if your going to make a game than do it right thank you:)
5934	0	a	Got game for 99% off... Should've waited for a better sale, was not worth -1/10
5935	0	a	Even for 1.50$ this game is a huge waste of money, plain and boring, dont buy
5936	0	a	The Metacritics were right!!
5937	0	a	One of the worst games on steam. Unplayable. If I could remove it from my game library permanently I would.
5938	0	a	When this game first came out in beta it was known as orion : dino beatdown...It was a complete and utter junkheap then...Hardly anything worked and the gameplay was crap.However with the most recent update 12/21/13 it has slowly started to redeem itself and is slowly starting to become a good game.   * Never mind its still a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5939	0	a	This game can be, 'fun' but it really isnt that great. The graphics arent what they were portrayed to be and most everything else is just terrible quailty, do not reccomend.
5940	0	a	why the f does it not run right f***** douches i s[ent 15$ on it
5941	0	a	Glitchy, unplayable, boring, not fun, broken, poor ai, bad sound effects, bad graphics, strange physics... there just isn't a positive thing to say about it. Avoid it.  The game has been 'updated' since I wrote this but you should know the full history of the game:  Release week: game literally unplayable. Literally, you could open the program and not actually play the game due to some networking issues. Dev's blamed it on steam.  Week later an update came out 'fixing' the problem but you could only get the game to work by messing with some things. IE: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing with the program.  So now you could kind of sort of play, right? Well, I was treated to one of the glitchiest games I've ever experienced, far worse than Dead Island. Things that happened included: hitting a pterodactyl corpse with a jeep and shooting STRAIGHT INTO THE SKY. The dodgy AI also got stuck inside buildings somehow, so that was entertaining. At one point I saved up money for 20 or so minutes to buy a flying thing, then immediately (like 50/70 feet above the ground) hit the skybox and either took damage or blew up (it's been a while). Also pretty sure I bought a walker, stepped off the pad (maybe 2/3 feet) and fell, taking damage or blowing up.  There's also this:   http://imgur.com/a/G2sts/noscript   This game was broken on release and the dude is super shady. The game was renamed to get around crappy metacritic scores and then the new game had the metacritic padded with fake accounts. After about two years is the game playable? Yeah, sure. It's just not very fun.  There's so much information on this game out there and if you're actually considering it, please go educate yourself on the history to it. Please.  Update as of Sept 13, 2014:  Alright, it's been a few years and I guess this has gotten a lot of updates (and two name changes? To avoid the poor critical reception me thinks) so I had to ask myself: is this game fun now?  Well, no, it isn't. It's been updated a lot, there are a lot of new features and the visuals are better. Hell, I would even go so far as to say this is an actual game now!  But when I join I still don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do (I kill dinosaurs, sure, but I don't understand the objectives at all -- probably because I haven't played enough). The AI is still dodgy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and can be outwitted simply by jetpacking on top of a building. Vehicles are still op in that going back and forth will just mow down an entire wave. Worst part? All of the new features have just further alienated me from the game. I don't know what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is worth geting and what isn't, which might not matter since everything just runs out of ammo very quickly anyway.  This game is still a pass. I'd recommend killing floor over it because the mechanics are similar but Killing Floor is actually good and fun. I will say Orion had and possibly still has a lot of potential, and maybe it's fun with friends when you know what the hell you're doing. But then, so are a lot of things.
5942	0	a	This game... is broken and laughable.. want a laugh? sprint and look down at your legs flailing around... it's only a buck so... if you've got money to spend... go ahead
5943	0	a	Game play was glitchy at best
5944	0	a	C'mon, you know you want it. A dollar. There are dinosaurs, guns, vehicles, melee, all you need. BUT, only buy it if you have a friend to play with you, because this game is coop based. Have fun.  EDIT .: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE
5945	0	a	I changed my mind about this game, the soldiers are perfect but the dinosaurs on the other hand get stuck on any bush it hits and it is impossible to kill any soldiers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
5946	0	a	I am just dissapointed with Overkill. This is game is just bad. I loved the days of Dino Horde, but prelude is virtual trash. You downgraded us! Orion: Dino Horde was worth $15! Prelude isn't even worth $1. Also, I had 2 copies of Orion: Dino Horde in my inventory, and when it updated us to Prelude, they dissapeared. A sad, sad dissapointment.
5947	0	a	THIS STUPID GAME DOSENT WORK I HAVE ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND IT DOSENT WORK
5948	0	a	The graphics are out dated, most of the servers don't work. Lack of support for new players make the game unbalanced. Don't waste your money
5949	0	a	This game is glitchy and buggy and the gameplay lacks any kind of fun You are only trying to find the small dinos in the grass (they are hard to find) to kill em and the you shoot the big uns  nah
5950	0	a	Very laggy, wasn't able to do anything. I had just the game open and it glitched and lagged so bad. I felt like I was on DSL again. The graphics are nice, but it isn't worth the lag. I give it a one out of 5 stars, graphics are nice. Only good thing about tha game to be honest.
5951	0	a	consolitis. The slew of positive reviews are developer shills.  Do not fall for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.
5952	0	a	The game get's really boring with just PVE, it's all people play. The is no PVP community. 4/10 Community runied it.
5953	0	a	The games fun. When it works. Buggy as hell.
5954	0	a	Game costs a dollar for a reason. Crashed as soon as I joined a server.
5955	0	a	Survival game versus dinosaurs? Nah,i dont really like this game Because the story and level gap is to determine the game ==
5956	0	a	If you got the 99c to spend on something you might play two or three times, go ahead and purchase. I wasn't really into it personally. There are very few servers to play on and they're very laggy. The fact that you have to pay 99c for a game that could easily go on the free to play list (considering there's an in game shop) just seems like a bad business tactic. Maybe I just joined the wrong servers, maybe my internet was bugging out, maybe it's just not my type of game but I wouldn't recommend this one when there's sales on much better games out there.
5957	0	a	prelude is a downgrade from dinohoard dont buy this game and it lags the mouse alot even with almost everything disabled or minimul
5958	0	a	For me it crashed when tried to start a match Lowered graphics still crashed, I have a Geforx 9800 + Games like the Witcher 2 &amp; Batman Arkham Asylum work for me - Witcher 2 on low Batman on max  So maybe it just dosen't work on older cards even if they are capable
5959	0	a	This game is so terrible that it's hysterical, worth the pennies they're selling it for on sale just to laugh at it for an hour :D
5960	0	a	its a bad game. i bought on sale 2 bucks and it still wasent worth it and even though its only a $1 now its still hard to justify. the gameplay is repititve and not very satisfying. i played maybe two hours before i got super bored and never touched again. graphics suck as well. the action is decent but it still gets old fast. 3/10
5961	0	a	Possibly worse than 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' 10/10 would play games worse than WarZ again
5962	0	a	played this with a few friends for about 50 minutes, and we all got a lot of frame drops, easy to learn and understand if you have played things like killing floor with a few good extras. but over all its just annoying getting damaged costantly especially by the flying dinos and you either can't hit them because your frames have dropped so much you have to stop playing for a second or that they are already too far away to hit. Didn't enjoy
5963	0	a	lol trust its not even worth the 0.79p. basicly a complete rip off of killing floor but sooo bad.
5964	0	a	it is a lot like a more kid friendly version of the game evolve
5965	0	a	Atleast uninstal works...
5966	0	a	Wouldn't play it if it was free. Nothing exciting, there's no challenge or skill. Either your class can beat your challenger(s) or not. It's actually pretty frusterating because so many mechanics, ballences, or hitboxes make no sense. Just run around and shoot. There are much more multiplayers for free. If you like the concept of dinos vs humans -&gt; Primal Carnage. Occasional server bugs, but worth paying for over this.
5967	0	a	.99 cents and it still isn't worth the money.
5968	0	a	Lemmie just fix up the store description...  'ORION: Prelude' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that blunlty blends together half-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ visuals and subpar combat. It puts you and your former friends together into boring, bland battles using some of the most generic weaponry and clunky vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore modest-sized worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.'   I know this game is a dollar but it wasn't originally and this game tried to put out major damage control to try to not look terrible.  'Don't believe the reviews' my â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5969	0	a	to maney error's no mather what you do it always crash for no reason....
5970	0	a	Frankly, I say don't waste your money. This game has dinosaurs and shooting thats it. It gets repetitive and boring fast. The only enjoyment you can get from this is laughing at how bad it is.
5971	0	a	Absolute rubbish do not buy it
5972	0	a	i boht it and 1 week later it vanished from my library.but its a great game.
5973	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ CAVITY OF TUMOR BREAD
5974	0	a	First game I join. Dinosaurs with pirate hats attack. I then uninstalled.
5975	0	a	I do not recamend this game because its more of a one play only game then its boring, graphics are a no, multiplayer is a no, not that fun for me, mostly because I have a very fast very open cp and its very slow.
5976	0	a	this is awful
5977	0	a	Its like you pay for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5978	0	a	For a start micro transactions......In a paid game? Badly optomisted, poor quailty and just really crap over all.  10/10 would NOT play again
5979	0	a	Great if you like Halo with dinosaurs and toilet skid-marks for graphics. -10/10
5980	0	a	So after a lengthy debate with friends about this game, we came up with a fairly accurate description for it. Yes, with a few friends it can be fun for a limited time, but so can having syphilis. Then after a while you realize how bad it really is and wish you hadn't paid the money to get this horrible disease, and even with the help of friends its unbearably painful.
5981	0	a	The poor implementation of concepts has bugged this game ever since it was first called Orion: Dino Beatdown. What originally started out as a flawed game has now become a mish-mash of ideas, that is in my opinion unplayable. Whilst the ingame character, dinosaur, and vehicle models are terrible, graphics are not always everything. Well then, why is this game so poorly optimised that it lags on high-end computers? What's worse is that this game borrows concepts from other video games, and doesn't quite manage to properly implement them. The vehicle steering system is like Halo: CE, but 100 times worse, the second chance system is like Borderlands 2 but with no real challenge. Honestly, the best thing I did with this game was uninstalling it. I want my internet back, I want my wasted time back, but am I going to get them back? Answer: NO! Seriously, save your money and buy a game like Primal Carnage or Dino D-Day instead. Both are good examples of a humans vs dinosaur game done right.  My Score: 15/100.
5982	0	a	Dont buy this gameit is a waste of money and time
5983	0	a	It used to be called Orion: Dino Horde, but they re released it as an update not a new game and also the game sucks. (although it may be better than CoD ghosts but that isnt difficult to be better than ghosts

5985	0	a	If i could give this game away and out of my Game list i would. Dont bother. its terrible in every way
5986	0	a	there is nobody playing the game and i cant play@!!! 
5987	0	a	WHY THROW ALL THE GOOD STUFF OF DINO HORDE AWAY :(, now listen i know what your thinking, this game looks good but listen NO, there are graphical bugs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ LOADS, hey its worth 1 dollar but i hope this stays permanately until they fix the bugs. Oh did i also mention the menu has xbox controller button prompts, that spice up the review a bit?
5988	0	a	complete utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do not download, hopefully as people give it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ reviews they wont change the name again. Rest In Pestrami
5989	0	a	Just a big waste of time and money.
5990	0	a	I don't know about you guys, but for me, this is a weird experience, when i'm in the menu screen, for some reason my graphics card goes up to 60-70 celcius, which is kind of weird, keep in mind i can play Skyrim for hours with it being stable on 60 or maybe 70, but in this game, as soon as i start i can hear the fan speed increasing dramaticly... In case you're wondering what graphics card i use, it's GTX 670.
5991	0	a	All the demos are at like, 1/4th the speed of the actual game. The game itself is so incredibly fast that unless you know precisely how it works from the get-go, you're going to be spending a long time just figuring it out.
5992	0	a	It crashed after 9 minutes.
5993	0	a	Its very laggy i would rate this game a 6/10 the graphics aren't that good and its should be free for the games performance. Tell me what you think in the description.
5994	0	a	Why da F*CK did i buy this game for 0.99,- ? i dont know. 
5995	0	a	the trailer makes it look gret but the graphics glitches and driving are terrible and theres not even single player missions or bot matches, i could get better free to play games. Im so disappointed i wasted my money.  3/10
5996	0	a	Boring game, got it as Steam gift back in the days, never liked it and surely don't like it now.
5997	0	a	The only thing that i truly interesting about this game is the mysterious uninstall button. I wonder what happens when i push it?
5998	0	a	Primal Carnage is ALOT better than this pile of ****.
5999	0	a	I can't really understand all the positive reviews. I got the game, it chose 1280x1024 by default when I have a 1920x1080 screen. The shooting feels slugish, and the game is just a repetetive horde-grind with little variation between hordes. The graphics are decent at best, great in the early 2000's. Music is mediocre and the character customization is poor.  The bullets must travel at 100 meters a second or something, because unless the dino is on top of you, you have to track the target to make up for bullet speed.  Oh, and it's nothing like Halo. Such a click-bait.
6000	0	a	Steam says that I've got 2 hours on this crap. I can't refund it.
6001	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! BUGGY beyond beleief. Fun once you get it working, and in game, but until they fix a bunch of the problems, dont buy. 3/10
6002	0	a	THIS GAME SUCK BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!! THANKS GOD IT'S ONLY ONE DOLLER
6003	0	a	I'm glad the 'Quit game' button works.  This game is the most poorly optimised game I have ever launched, you know it's bad when you have to set the graphical settings to minimal with a 4GB graphic card. Please save yourselves by NOT purchasing this. I'm glad my friend bought a pack for us, so I can write a review. Please, do not buy this game. Developers need to optimise this game and fix several bugs to make it worthwhile...
6004	0	a	Think of owning this game like adopting a troubled child. Sure it'll grow, and sure chances are it'll get better year after year, but at some point when it's revealed that the child is actually a derranged serial killer, you'll wonder if it was born that way or if there was anything you could've done to avoid to. The answer is no.
6005	0	a	Look, just because a game is inexpensive doesn't mean it is worth your time. I thought with positive reviews and the inexpensive price, running and gunning for dinos sounded like an okay time. And it was, for the first hour... maybe two. It isn't even that it is a bad game, it really just isn't a good one, at least not without other players. Maybe they're all on privte servers or something, but pulic ones seem to be pretty sparse and while Bots can fill in, they are incredible stupid and apparently can do nothing other than prance about shooting dinos. Sounds like the point of it, right? Well, they don't provide cover fire if you need to rescue your generator and don't ever seem to work on objectives other than killing dinos. In a word, useless.   I'm not going to complain about graphics because they aren't that bad, though maybe it was my video card or something but I had some wonky glitches from time to time. Game modes are shoot dinos, shoot more dinos, shoot dinos and each other, shoot more dinos, and did I mention shooting dinos? The variations on the theme are not overly interesting. You guard a generator vs waves of dinos. You guard it against waves of dinos and an enemy team while trying to take out theirs. You capture objectives while taking out waves of dinos. I reallky wasn't exaggerating when I said 'shoot more dinos'.  Are there cool things you can do? Certainly. Is it awful? No. Am I recommending it? No way. I just think there are other things that could, would and should be more fun. If you really want something inexpensive and midly amusing to play for a few hours until something else you're aching to play comes along -- Orion may be the game for you. Otherwise, play some backlog, spend that buck on cards and make badges, or find something else and spare yourself a bit of grief.  As with all reviews -- this is merely my opinion and your mileage may vary.
6006	0	a	Just...Don't.
6007	0	a	The spec's need to be re-written. My computer is much more powerful than the Recommended System specs And I lag on the main menu, As well as in game. Fix this.
6008	0	a	its not that good at all
6009	0	a	Bored. If I could give it away I would.
6010	0	a	This may be one of the worst games I've ever played. I made it through one match before the mad animations, terrible graphics, and the lack of sounds for certain weapons got to me.
6011	0	a	This game sucks so bad....
6012	0	a	Its not good, like at all. Everybody is praising it because it used to suck but it still sucks. It is very, very far from being a good game. The fact that it used to be worse than this scares me and makes me wonder how it got on the steam store at all. 2/10 - Shameful.
6013	0	a	A new twist to the Zombie survival genre. With tons of farming tools you can slaughter zombies for days! To catch these dinosaurs you have to have things that are called 'PokÃ©balls'. After you have a full party of 10 members you can start platforming on some HARD levels. I have yet to meet a game that has flying bears that fall from space to mars. I recommend this game to anyone who likes Dance Dance Revolution.
6014	0	a	15 minutes of crap this game is so bad everything is bad
6015	0	a	PROS:  It's fun It's only a dollar  CONS:  It's laggy on my nvidia geforce gtx 980 It's repetitive It's unbalanced It's buggy  With the double damage upgrade and the longshot sniper you do so much damage it's ridiculous. Not only that but you can only suceed as an assault class for the jetpack. The clipping for anything but a flat surface is dreadul and you'll find yourself getting stuck often. When you fall into the void you don't die, you only continue to fall into the void which will force you to disconnect from the server.  It'll give you maybe 4 or 5 hours of gameplay before you get bored, more if you play with friends.
6016	0	a	Major update. Developers claim to have done some work on it (which i don't say they haven't). Same ol' Dino: Horde... Still not polished. Lags with relatively low dino count. I have gone from stable 60fps to 20-15fps when about 100 dinos kick in (with minimum graphics and perfectly meeting min. system specs,  
6017	0	a	Nice to see that these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s make it to where you cant even play the game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the steam community for putting this on here.
6018	0	a	I purchased this game when it was released, I don't remember what it costed me then, and quite frankly I don't want to know. The fact that I paid money for this game haunts me every time I see it on the store page, at least the rocks have textures now. 
6019	0	a	This game is a very poor, POOR game. It runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on my PC which was 600 euros a year ago which handles BF3 on high at 60 but nevertheless, I can't understand why this game makes my GPU cry in horror, the textures are beyond â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. This game looks like an early PS2 game. It looks like GTA Vice City in terms of texture work, and to be honest Vice City is kind of beating Orion: Dino Horde or 'Orion:Prelude' to make people think its not the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  The game is utterly boring. Wave after wave after wafe after wave of uninspiring enemies that look like they came from a Jurrasic Park movie...that was made in 1950. Its only wave of murdering t-rex after t-rex. The guns are all about the same, I only used the Dual pistols to feel like Max Payne, which didn't really work. There is absolutely nothing good about this game, NOT EVEN THE NET CODE. Me and my friend were trying to play together, we are both in Dublin and I was getting a ping of about 200.  0/10 DO NOT BUY.
6020	0	a	The game is basically Halo and Jurrasic Park. It's a good game but it's really laggy.
6021	0	a	Game plays like a 90s multiplayer Turok + Left 4 Dead with jetpacks and medics. It's clunky, amateur, and very poor overall. There is an element of genius and fun in this game, but that potential is never reached due to the shoddy dev work. This game is one that should've been left in the bin. Some things are better not revisiting.  2.0/10 Terrible. Plays like a HS project, worse than most subpar mods.  Reviewer has played ORION: Prelude as his first outing in this series.
6022	0	a	Silly, not my choice
6023	0	a	This game is garbage, absolute and complete garbage. The matchmaking is crap, it cannot be played in full screen without crashing. Please do not waste your money on it. Here are 4 free game keys if you feel you want to try it, someone may get to it before you, but hey, possible free garbage game. The devs are not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, they gave me the free keys to give to my friends since the game is crap, but I do not hate my friends, so I am not going to give them crap. The devs say that they have fixed issues, they have not. They seem like decent, but completely incompetant people.  7MJ2P-EH42R-FZRW8 38Y8L-74QFY-A352D MFHAH-F0CN7-4N8XP 8BXK7-0VV7F-GQBX9

6025	0	a	I played this game when it first came out and it was really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.... I just played the new version of this game and I don't know what the difference is. Still pretty bad... But whatever. Just not for me.
6026	0	a	I couldn't believe how bad this was. Worst game I've played all year. As much as I like getting to test games I wouldn't otherwise buy... This wouldn't even be worth downloading for free.
6027	0	a	If I diden't know any better I would say it's still in alpha. It looks like crap,sounds like crap,and runs like crap. Sry just calling it as I see it
6028	0	a	Pve normal and PVP only dinos vs ppl . Bad game not worth
6029	0	a	Waste of bandwidth.
6030	0	a	most garbage outdated game
6031	0	a	1/10  this game may be cheap and it may have come a long way from where it started but still it has a long way to go. the game is unstable, buggy and the graphics quality on the highest settings is nowhere near what you see in the screenshots on the storepage. the character models and animations are just auful and the interface is strangly aranged.   now let's talk about the gameplay...   the consept of this game is good but they should have thought it out more. the game play get's very repetative very quickly.  the whole game is just:  spawn -&gt; activate generator -&gt; shoot dino's -&gt; shoot more dino's -&gt; buy new gun -&gt; shoot big dino -&gt; shoot more and more dino's until you die. then repeat on a (hardly)different map.  untill you get so borred that after a while you find the greatest feature in this entire game: The uninstall button.  so in concusion:  should this game be free?  yes  should this game be version 3.0?  definitly not, it is barely the level of a alpha prereleace.  if the developers update the game would you play it?  no, they have been at this for 3 years and it is still not better that a school project. it is unlikely that they will start to take this project seriously now.  is this review to harsh?  maybee, this is just how i experienced this game. maybee you will love it. but i don't, i took my time writing this so people think twice before buying this game. i know it is only 1$ but that single dollar could help little children in akrika get a proper education.. just think about that for a second before buying this so called 'game'.
6032	0	a	i got thet game free  :P 
6033	0	a	THIS IS THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! DO NOT INTALL THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! IT IS A WASTE OF DATA! 
6034	0	a	An improvement atleast
6035	0	a	Day 1: Im surviving Forever. Day 2: Seriously Im not going to let a dino eat m... *Din eats*
6036	0	a	This terrible game popped up in my library one day. I think a friend gifted it to me.  1. Play for trading cards 2. Sell trading cards 3. Uninstall 
6037	0	a	The game, though enjoyable, has its flaws. For one, it can't run AT ALL on any computer that isn't high-end. Therefore, I am unable to write a suitable review for it. If you have a high-end computer, good for you. If not (I'm assuming most of you don't...) don't waste your money. Orion: Prelude gets a 4/10.
6038	0	a	I tried to like it        but I really, really dont.
6039	0	a	I remember playing this a long time ago and thinking it sucked. It has potential, but it sucked. Now for 74 cents, it still sucks. The game feels too 'cardboard'. Guns lack oomph or any muzzle flash. Id prefer it if the dinos didnt actually walk, just glide around at least that would make it funny.
6040	0	a	worst game ever so many glitches it never works dont get this game.
6041	0	a	Turok with better graphics... need I say more?
6042	0	a	I bought it because it was onsale and they said they transformed the game into something amazing, they were wrong.  -half the time the gun animation doesn't even play  -the dinos still spin around and dont have very good ai  -the character holds the pistol like a assault rifle.
6043	0	a	the game lags like hell and i cant even play it the game iss to laggie and no one cant play it cuzz one small dino kills you
6044	0	a	I would rather eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ than play this game for 1 minute. (My playtime is idleing cards)
6045	0	a	Crashes on startup.
6046	0	a	I personly liked the gameplay from the beginning. My only problem with this is game and the reason why i am still not going to play it is, that it has only support for some common screen resolutions but my 1280x1024 is still not supported. And nothing is more infuriating that playing with the wrong resolution. Don't get me wrong. I like it that you have improved and fixed a lot of stuff. But the only thing i am asking for is to get the resolution problem fixed.
6047	0	a	Its not the worst and if your friends just need a break from something else go for it. However, even with the tiny price, there are far better games like it. I wouldn't recomend getting this soley because I haven't touched it since the last summer sale. I just don't like it. I would wait for the summer sale to spend your 2 bucks on, this isn't just worth it in my own opinion.
6048	0	a	Animations suck. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ motion blur on the dinosoars. Bad quality sound Crappy UI yeah I think that's all.
6049	0	a	It's fun the first few minutes, it's not a fun game to play and of course the game is $0.99 so I wouldn't compare it to other dinosaur-fps games like Turak or w/e. But It was fun, the bad part about is that the mouse sensitivity doesn't match with the menu options and in-game. And what that means is if my mouse sensitivity is fast in game, it'll be super slow while I'm in the options/menu screen and buy menu screen. Also once the bots discover the vehicles, that's all they'll use; All 3 will stay in the car and just drive around, sometime they'll stay still but most of the time they're just crusin' around. Which wasn't that helpful, but once again, this game is only partially fun if you play with friends. If you don't have a 'super computer,' or at least a decent computer, I don't recommend buying this game, because even on the lowest graphic settings, it'll still run really horribly. Also there's some parts in the game you get stuck in. This is all I've summed up from playing it for like 5-10 minutes, I would've played longer, but I had to disconnect because I got stuck twice, and couldn't get out without disconnecting and rejoining.
6050	0	a	These idiots need to update something because i cant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ play, it crashes too much
6051	0	a	So you are thinking of buying a Dinosaur FPS... for $1. What does that mean? What can you expect?  This game is heavily based on Unreal Tournaments invasion gameplay mode, you and a group of other people spawn and try to 'protect your base' from swarms of varying types of dinosaurs. Some are simple to spray and smear, others require larger amounts of bullets, etc etc.  Does it even stand out from mods you can download for unreal?  Personally... I enjoyed the little bit of it I played. While half of the features I was expecting to see didn't exsist or work, the game itself worked like you'd expect. Aim gun, pull trigger, watch dinosaur get mad/die, rinse and repeat. Some of the dinos had some entertaining bugs, but overall nothing too special.  What makes this game a bit interesting is the melee system they added in for PVP. It almost feels like PVK (Pirates Knights and Vikings) with about as much hit detection issues. It's laughable, and in some cases terrible. But strangely I enjoyed the experience (probably because I realized I got the whole mess for less than the cost of a humble bundle minimum).  Would I recommend this game? Not really no, as honestly your money should mean a bit more to you than to waste on a game that already exsists in another franchise. But if you are bored, have a buck, and wanted to waste a bit of time trying to play a game that doesn't really have that much to offer, I guess you couldn't go too wrong.
6052	0	a	After playing for half an hour I guess I know y this game is so cheap. Because it's cheap. Nothing attractive, u can get the best weapon in coop after the first wave.  No challenges and strange task settings. And btw, totally a terrible firing sense. DONT BUY THIS GAME.
6053	0	a	im not really into this game it lags like hell so i cant move/turn around witthout doin somat stupid and there is nothing there to kill when i join a multiplayer game so yeah... its crap for me (i wanna get a refund but i dont know how)
6054	0	a	flippin bad the same as the last one
6055	0	a	This is the most terrible game ever. Within 3 minutes of opening, I quit.
6056	0	a	It's still crap. It's a meh horde mode game, it isn't worth the $3.00 I spent on it. Thank you Valve for allowing refunds
6057	0	a	'GAME'S DON'T FAIL DEVELOPER'S DO' -project Orion: Prelude  Seriously? Games do fail because the developers fail, and now you just sound like pretentious â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. Just wanted to clear that up before I start my review. If this game was so good all of a sudden, believe me, you wouldn't be charging a 1$ for it, I got it for 75 cents because it was on sale. Anyway this game is exactly what I'd expect a 1$ game to be :  BUGGY HALF BAKED TEDIOUS (and not in a fun way like Doom 3, Resident Evil 4, or Dead Space)  The controls are godawful even with a controller, the graphics? HAH! IDK who worked on the trailers but they look better than the actual game. There isn't a good variety of dinosaurs to fight and the ones they have are the bland vanilla standard types (velociraptors, T-Rex, triceratops, and the flying ones). Gameplay is pretty bland and is very broken once you get the right abilities.  AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MICROTRANSACTIONS!  Because yes, SPOILER ALERT: there are microtransactions to change your character's look, despite the fact I got charged up front. And yes I am aware I got it for under a dollar but still, after I pay you, there shouldn't be any â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ microtransactions because I've already paid you.   Now for the million dollar question:  IS IT FUN?  Yes, for about ten minutes, because after that you've seen everything the game has to offer. The different classes are useless because their abilities really don't add anything.   I wasn't expecting much from a 1 dollar game, but after they make bold statements about how their game had this rag to riches story, I was expecting something decent and worth my time. Instead I get something that isn't worth more than 20 minutes at most.  
6058	0	a	Sucks.  generic fps with dinosaurs guns sound like airsoft sounds are gross vehicles are clunky or overpowered stores are meh its not satisfying  2/10
6059	0	a	I would not reccomend people to play this game as I think it leaks replayability.  To me it is just shooting AI dinosaurs till they die and get some points to buy some weapons. It looked more appealing that it actually was. Very repetitive and little variations on how to play the game.
6060	0	a	Dont buy this game. For $0.99 it's a rip-off.
6061	0	a	i dont care how many updates they had. this game isn't even worth 99 cents in my opinion
6062	0	a	NOT A JOKE REVIEW  One of the worst games I have ever played. The graphics are absolutly trash. THe dino AI is simulatenously OP and dumb. The weapons are all the same and the minimap might as well not be there.

6065	0	a	Don't. Buy. This. Game. Think of it as badrats 2.
6066	0	a	It is a very laggy game (needs Improment (Fast) ) 
6067	0	a	Eh... it's a dollar. Grab it, have a bit of fun with it.  Honestly though, I just didn't find it fun. It's still really unpolished and clunky.  The menus are just horrible. Both in looks and in feel. The customization menu is terrible. Like... it all works, it's just not an enjoyable experience.  It's hard to complain about it considering the price, but it's just annoying to look at.  
6068	0	a	Not too good, the game is utterly broken and the animations are cringe worthy. I would buy this for laughs but be wary, you will want your .99 back instantly as you join a game
6069	0	a	always crashes as soon as i open
6070	0	a	its ok but dont think of all those other reviews u see will trick u get it on sale its a ok game but tbh i dint like it i was expecting like zombies but dinosors but it just dosnt work right with me
6071	0	a	Probably one of the worst games I've ever played.
6072	0	a	Tried changing the resolution from 1280x960 or whatever crap it was on to my 5:4 1280x1024. NOPE. The setting doesn't exist. They have 16:9, 16:10, and 4:3. But not 5:4. When I applied my graphics settings, the game went black and my screen was constantly blinking. alt+tab didn't do anything and ctrl+alt+del would bring up Task Manager, but still wouldn't let me use it because my screen was blinking. Alt+F4 did nothing to it as well. Had to restart my computer.  TL;DR  -Stupid resolution settings -Game crashed my computer before I even started playing
6073	0	a	Ark: survival with lasers and without good.
6074	0	a	i want to refund this game.
6075	0	a	Now i know this game improved a lot but it still glitches and crashs,the home menu cursor is not sensitive enough and just dont play because it costs 75p try Halo instead
6076	0	a	boring useless and stupid game , i regret that i bought this crap!!!
6077	0	a	got boring real quick
6078	0	a	So much nope. Don't buy it. This game is a buggy, laggy, unpolished... heck, even uncompleted, mess.
6079	0	a	Probably the worst game I've ever played. But you can stab dinosaurs in the neck with a knife. 10/10 GOTY
6080	0	a	This game sucks my other left nut
6081	0	a	The graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is boring, and the mechanics are clunky. I bought this last year when they at least pretended it was worth something (base price of $9.99). The game now only costs $.99. This is not a quality game. Don't waste a penny on this
6082	0	a	Tried out one server, then hated it. Hard to get momentum in this game. Slow. Sloppy. -infinity/10
6083	0	a	At least the uninstall button is working 11/10
6084	0	a	Don't even bother trying it. It lags and you have no idea what's going on. Just a really bad game.
6085	0	a	'I got the game and it still had really bad Graphics and lag OMG.'
6086	0	a	probably the worst game i've ever played in my life
6087	0	a	not a game for me
6088	0	a	4/10
6089	0	a	Oh my god. Worst game experience ever.  1. The hardware requirements are ridiculously high. I can play many games on high settings. Here I have input lag in the menu and low FPS even on 720p .... 2. 'Connection to Host lost'. Joining a game (with decent internet connection) is like russian roulette. 3. Map design is confusing. Makes me miss battlefield or basically any other shooter. 4. Shotgun: 25-100 Damage. Fists: 4700 Damage. Why the hell should I buy weapons?
6090	0	a	Right,,,  So I got this game during the free weekend, and played it for a little bit, and was lucky enough to get a free key of it by the end of that weekend, I would load it up when I was bored, and would just play for a little bit. And now, after 6 hours of this game, I can safely say that it was terrible.  The game is a mess, even after all the updates. For starters, graphics customization does almost nothing to fix the frame rate, which went from pretty good to PowerPoint levels of slow by the end of a game. The AI is just awful, the Pterodactyls in particular being a major pain in the *** (imagine trying to hit something flying through the air with a PowerPoint frame rate). The game is just littered with technical issues, many of which render it unplayable. I can't think of a single time I quit that wasn't due to some technical issue.  However, I still liked parts of it. Its a good concept, just terrible delivery. The developers know this, and dropped the price down to just a dollar. Even then, it goes on sale all the time. So, to wrap up this crappy review for a crappy game, buy it if you want to, but don't expect much
6091	0	a	Was only able to connect to one server,  
6092	0	a	its a glitchy game
6093	0	a	Do not believe the lies, sucks a dead goats â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and the goat died of aids!
6094	0	a	This is a horrible game in every way and should never be touched by anyone. There is a reason it keeps going on sale for over 90% off and it isn't because it's a life changing experience everyone should go through, unless they're you're worst enemies.
6095	0	a	It is laggy and had a bad graphix on my pc but it has great dino-combat series , it doesn't have much weapons so kinda sad
6096	0	a	This is not ARK
6097	0	a	It's a broken game worst game ever it sucks
6098	0	a	They update the game allright...with micro transactions...
6099	0	a	It's just plain boring/not well designed. Fun for about an hour, but no real challenge or reason to come back.
6100	0	a	This game I thought had a lot of promise when i got it as a gift but when i played it it was horrible. it always lags lots of errors and i can never get into a server.Should you buy it?NO Only if the developers fix this will it be a good game in my eyes.
6101	0	a	game is my â™¥â™¥â™¥
6102	0	a	It's boring, too repetitive, dinos come in waves and that's pretty much it, because I don't even know what's the point of the game or what do I have to do because there's no tutorial or introduction. Thank god I only paid 0.59â‚¬ and can get back some of it from the cards. Not to mention it crashes if I try to play it on fullscreen for some reason.
6103	0	a	I can't play this game. Screen will turn black then crash to desktop upon opening the game.
6104	0	a	I can't see many problems with this, but it's simply just... Not fun. I tried to get into it but it got very boring very soon. It was also extremely confusing at first and took a lot of questions in chat to understand what I was doing. Thankfully it didn't cost too much. :)
6105	0	a	this game is still in need of work. i got the game for a dollar so its not a bad deal. just could be better than what it is now and what the game want's to be.
6106	0	a	Multiplayer game where one team fights as humans and the other team as dinosaurs. The human party has various weapons options and the different dinosaurs has abilities, whether is is flying, jumping, strong attacks or great defensive armor.  The game itself is actually well thought through and the game offers a lot of possibility, but the game is poorly optimized, the server lobby has flaws in connecting to games and several things ingame leaves you frustrated.  It's a game in progress, but they have to do much more work to compete with other games. Still, the game is very cheap and if you don't need insane graphics and flawless optimization, then it's a game for you.  Pros  * Originality * Team based fun * Diversity in characters (Dinosaurs - big, small, flying, crawling) (Human - Recon, Assault, Medic)  Cons  * Game needs optimizing * Glitches * Bad dinosaur models (bad handling leaves you with some of them not able to attack) * Bad landscaping (Getting stuck ingame) 
6107	0	a	This... Is one of the worst games I've ever played I would rather slowly die then play this horrible horrible 'game' again for your own sake please don't ever purchase this thing it feels like it should be illegal to make something this horrible
6108	0	a	This game is really bad. And not like Goat Simulator fun, funny bad. Just bad.
6109	0	a	I bought this game because of my love of dinosaurs, and it was only a buck, so I thought, 'Why not?'. I watched all the videos provided above, and they seemed really cool! Until I started the game. Unfortunately, I am not able to join any servers, no matter how hard I try. The closest I have gotten to real gameplay is being on the server list when the game is about to start, and then it just says I have lost connection to the host. I wish I could play this game for hours and hours and recommend it, but with these issues I just can't.
6110	0	a	Almost as high-quality as E.T for the Atari 2600.  do you like devs who boost reviews on their own games? this is a great start
6111	0	a	Why does this game even exist?
6112	0	a	Totally not recommended. Awful graphics and without any tutorial at all. So I just spawned somewhere, without knowing what to do or where to do so.
6113	0	a	Terrible game bad animations to much walking to slow for what it is trying to be...
6114	0	a	It's freexing to death. I don't know why it's popular.
6115	0	a	It is not playable! It has too many lags! I have tried out all the bugfixes but it does not work. So I removed this laggy game from my library. It could be funny, but it was frustrated...
6116	0	a	This game, just given away by our great fella Steam, has proven me that a game can be WORSE with a bit of effort. After 2 normal intro, such as the Unreal Engine and Spiral animations are, we're sent to a small menu with a great music *sarcasm* that will make you think about the Pirates of the Caribbean OST, but it has nothing to do with it *sarcasm again* What if we talk about the gameplay? Multiplayer shooter, with DINOSAURS! It might have been worth the 2,7 GBs of download. Let's look for any server to play... oh wait, right, with over 2600 players on, this marvellous game has only 26 SERVERS, which of those 3 are private, 15 are DLC servers, and 8 are either full or empty, so you can't play with anyone you might not know. Well, single-player might still be good right? NO campaign, NO one-person survival, and of course, the game will load up with NO complete game at all, since it'll keep looking for players. A disappointing experience, and a game I wouldn't recommend at all.
6117	0	a	i cant join or see any lobbies, i can only play solo, can soemone fix this bug please thanks
6118	0	a	keeps loosing connection to games even when i creat my own lol what a pice of garbage.i also have 50 mbps so not my internet problume.
6119	0	a	This Game is all about killing dinos why i give this game a dislike? well.. 1.this game doesnt make any sense for me ( really man shooting dinosaurs with guns?? this aint jurassic park) WTF is the point of this game? 2. Boring Boringgg sooo Boringggg 3.lots of bugs ( what will you do if you see invicible dino attacking your teammate ?)well 'Delete button' Work perfectly 4.nothing special,no cool feature(that's mean this game sucks alot!)  Well if you guys love dino survival  find a better one for example  http://store.steampowered.com/app/346110/  this one ATLEAST better in my oppinion  feel diffrent? tell me your oppinion i love to read other's  work the same way with my other reviews 
6120	0	a	I would advise people not to buy this game, even for 99p or 99 cents. When I bought this game is was called Dino Beatdown, it was glitchy on my pc and my friends pc's. The ingame menu and junk was total crap. Now it has a new title in hopes of getting more money from unsuspecting people on steam. That is wrong. Even now this game is glitchy still looks like a piece of sh*t
6121	0	a	totally unplayable it looks okay but even after knocking every setting to it's lowest point I could barely walk without lag let alone shoot or interact with anything I payed 54 cents for this and that was 54 cents too much really just stick to other Dinosaur games unless you have a perfect computer then it might work for you...maybe
6122	0	a	The trailer for the is game says that it has gotten alot better over time. I have to say 0.50 for this game seems a bit much.... if that tells you anything.
6123	0	a	This game is like the new Jurassic World..... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!!!
6124	0	a	this game will constantly lag through out the game 
6125	0	a	No... Just No
6126	0	a	Not worth 1 cent. Don't even bother.
6127	0	a	the worst game i've played
6128	0	a	This game has so much potential o be a fun time-waster. It's inexpensive, it has a fun premise, and it's got a motha-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' T-Rex in it.   But it's just awful gameplay wise. The frame skip and lag levels are UNBELIEVABLE and it is utterly unplayable. I tried re-installing it twice and setting the graphics to the absolute minimum to make sure that I could run it smoothly, but it was still impossible to play effectively.   Once (if ever) these issues with lag and frame skipping get fixed, this game will be so much fun. I only hope it does happen, because I'm ready to start gunning down dinosaurs.
6129	0	a	Mutliplayer is garbage, riddled with bugs, no lan support, and dedicated servers are near impossible to set up for private lobbies
6130	0	a	you frekin crashed my computer with your frekien bugs
6131	0	a	Good game. Highly recommended to play it with friends. The reason I didn't give a recommend to this game is because it's poorly optimized. If you can get past it, it's a really damn enjoyable Co-op game!
6132	0	a	this game is lagging alot
6133	0	a	pros:good graphics,no dlc, its fun. cons:glitchy, laggy, broken, unfinished.
6134	0	a	Saw all the good reviews and saw the trailer and expected something amazing. I was greatly dissapointed. Right at the start I noticed terrible optimization and the graphics aren't even that good so it shouldn't take a good PC to run. Very confusing controls and very hard to learn. Lots of bugs I noticed when I used a jetpack and there was a big dinosaur he got me and I was stuck in him. I would not recommend buying this game not even for the $0.99 that it is. Buy a different game either wait for a steam sale to get a cheap game or get a DLC for a game you already have, it just isn't worth it.
6135	0	a	IGRA SUKA
6136	0	a	This game sucks. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! 0/10
6137	0	a	Bought it because my friends and I loved how bad it was when it was free, so I bought the four pack because it's hilariously bad while being semi-fun. Well, it would seem that on not only my computer but my two friends the game will not start. I can click play, I see the small Steam window saying it's starting, and then nothing happens.
6138	0	a	I rate this game 2/5 Nearly Ok but it's actuallly bad.  Sure this game is cheap. Sure this game is fairly free. Yes the online community is friendly. The graphics are okay. But this game is also extremely repetitive and it lacks any great music or sound effects or anything to really keep me interested. You Hunt dinosaurs on alien planets with futuristic weaponry. The dinosaurs die (mostly) and wave after wave of them come at you. There are some other game modes but in my opinion they all lack challenge and are variations on an underlying theme of repetitive gameplay leading to boredom. This might be a lot more fun if you know someone else who is really into this game and wants to play it with you but I know no such person.
6139	0	a	Incredible resource hog. spend your .49 cents else where
6140	0	a	This game literally sucks. Objectives are stupid the graphics are awful and again and again the same dinosaurs
6141	0	a	I changed the resolution of it and the game is flashing down into my desktop and i can't change it back someone help
6142	0	a	I really don't know... I feel like it was better as Dino Horde than this. I'm sorry, but this change made me stop playing the game entirely.
6143	0	a	Amidst the plethora of multiplayer dinosaur games released around the same time as this one, came ORION: Prelude, previously going by a different name I can't remember.   Frankly, I found this game to be a waste of what short time I spent on it and the $1 that I spent on it as well. It is un-original, has some of the quirkiest physics and game mechanics I have ever seen, and in general just really fails to deliver an enjoyable experience outside of the initial learning phase. There isn't anything unique or fun about this game and it really ended up being $1 I would rather have bought candy at a gas station with.  The game got boring quick, with nothing different than any of the other dinosaur games really, and seems to have a fanbase with similar personalities to the people who drool over Nazi Zombies in the latest Treyarch Call of Duty release. The developers seem to be having fun with it, which is good, but I honestly don't see a reason to promote them for this game in the slightest. They delivered a fairly buggy, un-original title amongst a sea of the same genre.  I would not recommend this game, even given its extremely low price point.
6144	0	a	Kind of like old school Tribes, without skiing, and more clunky feeling.
6145	0	a	Gets very tedious very quickly. Even with friends the game isn't nearly as fun as games such as a Left 4 Dead or any other Multiplayer Shooter Siege-Survival. If you need a budget game there are many others but this one has ill-defined objectives, very basic gun selections, and a broken health system (where you can be fully healthy for a few rounds then instantly die to a small mob of dinosaurs which are impossible to hit).
6146	0	a	Game no workie. Tried the only 'fix' posted on the Steam forums; got as far as splash screen. Worst part is it makes my computer practically unusable until I manage to forcible end the various processes associated with the game. I want my time and $.50 back.
6147	0	a	lets just say that i play 1 min and then i just used idle master on this...
6148	0	a	Uhh... No.
6149	0	a	This game is pretty cool
6150	0	a	Gets boring very fast.
6151	0	a	Still one of the bugiest game I've ever played. One sound for all weapons and general chaos.
6152	0	a	Bought this game to play with a friend and when I entered the match, it just keeped rotating non-stop, I restarted the game, restarted steam and the pc, and it was still rotating when I entered any match...
6153	0	a	I should be able to run this, but I'm very,very laggy, lowest settings
6154	0	a	This game is trash 
6155	0	a	This game used to be my favorite but now with all it's updates and stuff it just went down. Yet now it appears to have more lag and Framerate issues. The gameplay is fun but hard to enjoy. So I would not recommend it at the moment
6156	0	a	Really lame, and there's no 'singleplayer'
6157	0	a	lAgs to much
6158	0	a	The trailer happily points out this used to be a horrible game; it also claims it no longer is. Only the first claim is correct. This game is so broken i couldnt be bothered to figure out its moronic game play or control scheme. I bought this game only because it was fifty cents and figured even if it sucks i couldnt lose; how wrong I was.
6159	0	a	If your friends own this game somehow, mayb- Nevermind, don't buy this game. Even though it's cheap, don't spend your precious time with this. Unfortunately unsuccessful.
6160	0	a	It's bad. This game is honestly one of the worst games i've ever played, i only payed $1.50 for it and i'm regretting my decision. Just please don't buy this game.
6161	0	a	Wtf how can I write this review while I don't even own this game. Silly steam.
6162	0	a	The FPS is horrible, and i thought after having this game for a few years and attempting to come back they would have atleast fixed the fps. no its not my computer, i have a gaming computer, its the servers zzz
6163	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible.
6164	0	a	Bought this game for laughs tried to get a refund and have not got a refund yet. (P.S THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE)
6165	0	a	I'm doing this review because I want a badge.                                   Lol.
6166	0	a	Needs more players
6167	0	a	I'm happy I only bought this game for 55 cents. It wasnt worth it. Not only can you make dinosaurs fly, but you can also be sent flying by them. Unoptomized too, It sucks to play, I probably damaged my eyes.
6168	0	a	Seriously bad, and not 'oh its so bad its good. Its just bad,
6169	0	a	Why i bought this ?
6170	0	a	eeeeeeehhh im playing on a windows 7 but it still has So much framerate drop and lagg i dont reccomend this game i might come back t it soon and try it again though but i reccomend you get the following required before you buy the game
6171	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up.
6172	0	a	If I could get my dollar back, I'd do it!
6173	0	a	Hideous game easily breakable wildly unbalanced but hey its cheap. Might get a day of fun out of it if youre playing with friends
6174	0	a	Terrible game, do not purshase. BUGs, bad gameplay and historyless.
6175	0	a	Servers are crap, it's always laggy, no tutorial ( so I was pretty much lost), and worst of all i bought so I could play it later, it passes by the return date, i play, and it's bad. These are just my thoughts, if you had a blast with the game, good for you, but these are my thoughts, so I could care less
6176	0	a	I don't recommend this game at all. Should pay the money for the game. You will not like it because the graphics are so bad.
6177	0	a	'In 2012 we released one of the worst games of all time'                         Still sucks 
6178	0	a	this game is not fun
6179	0	a	(Pukes)   I hate this game. It is so laggy even tho it looks crappy. Ive been playing on lowest settings and I got like 2 frames more. And the gameplay doesnt even make any sense. You are a Halo guy that needs to survive hordes of dinosaurs. Wtf im outta here
6180	0	a	I try to join a friend, it crashes. I try to get in a tank, it crashes. I shoot at the T-REX, it crashes. I am the last person alive on my team, we are an hour into the game, I am against every big boss Dinos and my whole team depending on me. My Game PLANE CRASHES INTO THE DAMN PENTAGON, AND EXPLODES, THEN STARTS THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. (hope I did not offend any body. If I did I am sorry)
6181	0	a	I will never forget the injustices done here.
6182	0	a	1 Dollar was wasted. I can't even launch the game.
6183	0	a	Don't bother. I am not even going to waste mopre than these to sentances for the review.
6184	0	a	It is not a good sign when the game has the graphics of a mid 2000s arcade game and has 15 fps. A game with graphics this average does not need to take up that much of my computer's power. I can run open world games that have better graphics at higher frame rates. i havent even started on the gameplay, which is ok at best, you basically just run around and shoot the little dinosaurs. I chose the assault class and the only weapon i could use was a pistol. Although I am sure this is due to my mental retardation, it still shouldnt spawn the assault class in with just a pistol, especially if you arent gonna use traditional ways of switching weapons (mousewheel, numbers etc.) and that is assuming it even has a rifle.  5/10 Wouldnt waste 5 mins on this ever again
6185	0	a	10/10 my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ got chopped of by an toster
6186	0	a	10% luck 20% skill  15% concentrated power of will 5% rage 50% pain 0% reason to purchase this game 
6187	0	a	This so stupid but if you have friends you won't stop playing it.
6188	0	a	Ruined my life.
6189	0	a	Very fast gameplay  Lag even on lowest settings  What more can I say?  Otherwise, a very fun cooperative survival experience, offering unique dinosaur combat, and a great upgrade/weapon system.
6190	0	a	not worth 99 cent
6191	0	a	This game is the reason I cut myself in the morning.   Unquantivable on a number scale of how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a game this is out of 10
6192	0	a	For starters, this game crashes more than a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing drunk driver in a bugatti and it runs at 3fps or less even when i have a decent gaming PC.
6193	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6194	0	a	Terrible Game, Don't buy it.. get Primal carnage instead ;)
6195	0	a	It's barely playable but you can make most of your money back by selling the cards.
6196	0	a	laggy servers, no people play this game.
6197	0	a	One the one hand, its a dollar. on the other hand, its a dollar's worth. if you can find some buddies to play with you, sure, but otherwise this game is pretty well dead.
6198	0	a	okay well mabey i have a crap computer but this thing LAGS like crazy even in single player but heres the thing i own primal carnage and it doesnt lag my system. and i dont see dinosaurs having extremly cpu intensive AI here either
6199	0	a	My friends and I were arguing on Steam Voice Chat one day. We were trying to figure out the next multiplayer game we should all invest in. After agonizing deliberation that lasted several days over who was gonna scrounge up the hefty $2.99 sum for the 4-pack, we finally got the game. After all, how could we resist? It had dinosaurs and it was $2.99. How bad could it possibly be?  Prehistorically Bad.
6200	0	a	To laggy cant play idk if it the game but i know lots who are haveing the same problem it ruins the experience and it look like aploute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ worth Â£0.39 at max
6201	0	a	 2/10
6202	0	a	Lag Central. My system is above the recommended requirements, and with every video setting at low or disabled, it still lags when the dinosaurs attack.
6203	0	a	it seems really good but it runs incredibly poorly and the servers are laggy. even with all graphics setting turned to low i had an terrible framerate. The maps look really good and i had fun exploring them its just too bad i cant play a game in them. i suppose if you had an extra beefy computer and an awesome internet connection this game would be superb
6204	0	a	My Pc runs Skyrim on ultra, but for this I had to change settings on low  -Offline mode doesn't have bot -Online servers are often too laggy, my Stegosaur stomps human and they survive
6205	0	a	Super laggy with a decent computer. Graphics are god-awful. Even though it costed me 50 cents, it wasn't worth it. Don't waste your time with this.  0/100
6206	0	a	It was a good game... but the people there are asshats and its near impossible to find a game, on top of that there just insnt enough content to last long.
6207	0	a	Bad graphics, and boring gameplay. Not my type of game.
6208	0	a	Its not bad for what it is, and honestly if deathmatches (and a couple variations) on a few small maps with dinosaurs that die with one shot, limited feelings of progression, and a microtransaction store sound like fun...fill your boots. Hardly anything that even hints at the depth and scope of SC.
6209	0	a	Note: this is before recent changes that have drastically improved the game, still not great but better.  I do not recommend this game. It is literally the worst purchase I have ever made. The mouse sensitivity goes only from Super Extreme to Mega Extreme, the plays worse that Carnivores from the 90â€™s, there is literally no one else online and it looks nothing like the previews or screenshots that I'm sure youâ€™re looking at. You will get more enjoyment out of your money if you went to the bank and had it all turned into change, then subsequently ate all the change and waited anxiously for the aftermath.
6210	0	a	PLAY THIS GAME IT TOLD ME TO TELL YOU     
6211	0	a	Such a boring, bad made, ugly game.
6212	0	a	Even though it shows promises for an average game. the constant graphic problems that causes is really worrisome.
6213	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SICK.... ME AND MY BOYS SMOKE FAT BLUNTS AND PLAY THIS GAME. THIS GAME IS A FEAT IN THE GAMING WORLD WITH ITS LIT GRAPHICS AND NON â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME PLAY WOULD NEVER PLAY 10/10
6214	0	a	Good for an evening of playing with friends but not much else. Once you've had one fun go it never seems to capture that magic again.
6215	0	a	look yes i only played for 30 mins... but i bought this game as part of a 4 pack for me and my mates.... paid like a buck for it.. how bad does a game have to be.. that your m8ts try to return the game... and the dev's.. because of what ever they said.. Gave them more free copies to give away?!?!?!?  so NO.. this game is not worth even the $1 buck i paid......
6216	0	a	Don't.
6217	0	a	10/10 The best game I ever played, with action packed fun great teamwork all around! sarcasm intensifies
6218	0	a	  It is so bad! I had a good laugh with a friend while trying some multiplayer action. The delay between shooting animation and the sound, plus it is just so freaking clonky...
6219	0	a	meee not that great
6220	0	a	it sucks, low graphics and not many players
6221	0	a	1 hour of my life I will never get back! Thanks Mr Majestic!
6222	0	a	Admittedly my time was rather short with orion Dino Horde. In that time during the free weekend I found the game to have had plenty of potential that is sadly lost in a generally bland game. It's sad to say really because the premise is pretty fun really. Running around as a team of soldiers blasting any and all Dinosaurs that you see with a variety of weapons and vehicles sounds like immense fun until you start playing it.  The animations are subpar for both the soldiers and dino's. Men look like they are gliding along the floor as they 'run' while dino's charge around the map with their jaws hanging open but not making any sounds. The large opponents such as T-Rex make roars every now and then but Jurassic Park level sound design this is not.  Weapons are varied but they all look pretty bland. Most weapons have flat textures with blue lights on them and many feel particularly weak when fired, or simply miss half the time. The weather effects for the snowfall is atrocious and overall it just feels bad.  I know this is by a small team who have accomplished something here that I personally couldn't and if you don't mind the general chepness of the title it's probably not going to grate on you too much. Certainly a game best enjoyed with a few friends. If however you are looking to buy this for yourself to game with random people online, DON'T. It isn't worth it as a single purchase.
6223	0	a	Even though it's been well over a year since I bought this and even though I only paid less than it's $10 asking price when it was called Dino Beatdown, I still regret buying this game. When I first heard they were going to re-release it, I didn't care. The only reason I decided to reinstall it was to get the Steam trading cards. I have no shame.  Playing it again (yes, I actually played it instead of idling in the menu), I noticed right away that it was way less buggy than and MUCH better optimized, not to mention all of the new content that was added. However, all the problems I had with the first game that weren't glitches were still present when I played it last.  I'm not sure if they're still there upon writing this, but I honesly don't care since the damage has already been done for me. The weapons lack punch, the animation is a joke, the maps are needlessly big, enemies are brain-dead, can go from pathetically easy to unfairly difficult at a moment's notice even with other players, and is just not fun.   Also, WHY is there a microtransaction store? This is not a free-to-play game.  Despite saying all of that, I will give the developers credit for greatly improving the game over what we first got, but...you already know the saying about polishing a turd.  4/10
6224	0	a	Barely worth one dollar. If you can afford the computer required to run this, you can afford a better game then this. Reminded me of a horribly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ knock-off of halo: combat evolved mixed with dinosaurs. Most of the dinosaur models look like inflatable pool toys and the games motion blur hardley obscures the plastic looking models. Deresolution is so bad that my teammates look like the character from pitfall at 100 yards.  2/10  I would have said buy this if you've got no games on your steam account but TF2 is free-to-play now.  On a side note: HOW DARE THEY USE THE QUAKE KILL STREAKS.
6225	0	a	Probably the worst game I've ever played. Gameplay, animation, design, and concepts are all very poorly executed. In addtion to the actual feel of the game, it is primarily meant for multiplayer but there are no servers becasue no one is playing it. So, I tried to play single player... I played for about 10 minutes and kinda want my $1 back.
6226	0	a	This game held a lot of promise. However, the end result is boring, uninspired, and disappointing.
6227	0	a	wow, this game was free to play for the weekend and never before have I experienced a game so broken while still launching.  I've been attacked by dinosaurs through the ground several times, when thrown, grenades disappear until they hit the ground where they respawn and roll away for 4 seconds before exploding, in the one class I played you just jetpack onto or between rocks and no dinosaurs can get you except for t-rex that THROW ROCKS at you with it's teeth and the pterosaurs that fly around in glitchyness and fly flapping their wings while their nose is touching ground like it's ski-ing face first (when user controlled). I feel like they spent 80% of their time on the textures (which are pretty good) but very little on anything else, the world meshes feel like I'm walking on something sculpted of tinfoil so sharp are the angles (on rocks at least).  If this game were very early access alpha I would criticise it for being released before it was ready but it's been out for quite some time . . .
6228	0	a	won't even start up  just crashes 
6229	0	a	Repetitive, feels bad, looks bad, sounds bad, this game is just bad in every way.
6230	0	a	ORION:Dino Horde is an AWFUL experiance it has AWFUL graphics AWFUL gameplay and it's quite laggy when i played single player there was text on my screen saying WAITING FOR PLAYERS and in half an hour of playing i only saw 2 dinosaurs i went in thinking this will be like halo (good) with dinosaurs (AWESOME) i was partly right but it is just abysmal i hate it i hate it i cant recomend it it's so AWFUL!
6231	0	a	not even worth 0.99â‚¬ that i payed don't buy it, it is terrible
6232	0	a	So it seems to me that the map is just way to big and you end up running for minutes on end to get places and that dinosaurs at times can be way to overpowering if you dont have 4 or more people playing with you. Also the bosses can wreck if you are 4 or less. The matchmaking is absolutely garbage, with refreshing sometimes not working and trying to get into a game saying that you can connect but having a giant CONNECTING plastered on your screen. Friends can sometimes join games that you cant. Overall its a 4.5/10 in terms of gameplay quality and could be a meager laugh or too in coop play but there are far better options in terms of this catergory. BUT for a dollar you might as well buy it but for nothing more.
6233	0	a	Even for a dollar, Im not going to waste time or hard drive space on this prehistoric turd. All I want is a New Turok!
6234	0	a	this game was horrible. The graphics were crap, and the gameplay in general was just bs.
6235	0	a	Terrible game with a terrible GUI, awful server browser, unresponsive controls, dated gfx, crappy game modes, awful netcode. Just utter utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ not even worth .99p
6236	0	a	Controller support is laughable at most... 'USE' was not mapped out by default and there are no options that allow me to invert the axis or sensitivity. Those alone make this game not even worth .99 to me.
6237	0	a	If you want to waste you time, this is the game for you for 99p as it's on offer you get boring pointless fights with dinosaurs. the graphics are taty and gameplay feels inbalance so expect lots of dinosaurs coming at you like miley cyrus, as the AI tends to just twerk at the nearest player. The game has stupid physics dinosaurs can throw a tank in the air by hitting their head against it where it will bounce of the walls like it was made out of rubber. The guns are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you will be running around trying to hit a dinosaur with a shotgun but only registers if you hit it precisely with crosshair destryoing the whole concept the spread of the shotgun. No wonder it's 99p I read that it has been a lot better since update but you have been mislead, so 99p not a lot of money so if you want to try it go ahead I have played worse games. I give this 3/10 if your obessed with dinosaurs or survival games you might like it.
6238	0	a	the game by itself is good - the problem is with all the bugs it conteins, from windows errors to conection difficulties to servers the game keep disconnecting from servers, usually without any explanation of the reason, and also rase a lot of windows error while crushing. I tried this game on XP and on windows 7 - but results are the same. I guess thats why a good game was sold for 1$ price. (other games on steam never gave me any troubles)
6239	0	a	Glitchy, ulgy, horrible gameplay, seems like a 13 year old developed this, there is a good reason why this has a 36/100 on metacritic
6240	0	a	Dont be fooled by the cheapness of the game. Believe me its not worth the 1 dollar and GB on your computer. People are reviewing this game poorly for a reason and no amount of percentage off the $15 price is going to make it anymore value for money. The game feels like a mod, not an actually game made by a company. Play Killing Floor, as its much more ahead of the genre then this game is.
6241	0	a	Wow, where do you start. I thought this was a re-release or a new Beta or what have you. Turns out, this game has always been buggy and well, kind of bad. And it still is. Where do I start?!  The sound, well, it is just, bad? The voice acting, the quality of the voice recording, the sound levels, the guns, the dino's, the music that cuts in and out. All pretty bad. Not horrible, but it is kind of like they just dumped a bunch of stuff in there, DONE!  The Animations are just plain weird and buggy. Your main starting gun, when you draw it, is drawn before your hands are in position. What?! The scope zooming is done like this is a game from 2007. The Dino's jumping animation is bad, the bites are wayyy off, flying dino's make insane 180's midair, the T Rex takes weird bites from the ground and proceeds to trow these 'boulders' at you... They spin and are only half animated, one side is just flat. Did they ever take a look at this game? Did they even test it and play it themselves?  Physics, well, ehh. Yes, Shoot a 10 ton Stegosaurus with a bow and arrow for 20 times and it dies, but the last arrow sends it flying like crazy. But a tank shell on a minature critter has no impact. Oh and did you know, dino's can pound the ground and send you flying off into the air, but their own kind is just glued to the floor.  And then the actual gameplay. Did they ever test it? What where they thinking? You are teleported out of fortified buildings when the enemies come in. Never heard of using bunkers I guess. You NEED the jetpack, if you don't have it you are just picked up and dropped to death. And fightning from a rock is way to go. So why are there 3 classes? It won't help if they don't get something like the Jetpack. So you defend this generator, that has no healthbar and needs to be recharged. You get random vehicles for liberating outposts but it all has very arbitrary time constraints. These game modes just make NO SENSE AT ALL.  3/10, would not play if F2P. It is now, but even at â‚¬1 it is asking too much. This game is bad. Cool concept, nice scenery, but the gameplay and pretty much all else is bad.
6242	0	a	Andddddd. WTF It may have...some...potential. Considering the menu seems to lag a bit, it definetely has flaws, but i'm sure it would run smoother on an enthusiast's rig. APUs don't support much, even in the fabled 'Dual Graphics Mode'
6243	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing weird. Very small lobbies of five.    Its basically a dino versus human. You pick which side you're on... in lobbies of 5. Bigger lobbies would be a very fun game, there would be a lot of room for a f2p model like Tf2.   As is? not worth it
6244	0	a	You'd think a game with guns and Dino's couldn't miss.  You'd think.  but it's only a buck for now so might as well see for your self
6245	0	a	Its an OK game but thats it just OK. Nothing to write home about.   You start off with just a pistol. Really?!? And there is no way to play with just a controller you can fire with the controller but cant interact with anything eithout a keyboard so whats the point.   Visually it looks nice, not the best but not the worst either.   Worth $0.99? Eh, maybe. However, I dont find this to be something I would keep coming back to.
6246	0	a	This game sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T. DO NOT PLAY IT. CONTROLS FOR THE GAME AS PLAYIN AS THE DINOS ARE SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ED UP YOU CANT EVEN KILL ANYONE.
6247	0	a	Still cant find where my dogs at.
6248	0	a	keeps crashing when i try to play a game on it this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t
6249	0	a	This game really looked exciting. Kind of like a cross between Left 4 Dead and dinosaurs. However, this game was very disapointing for me. It had bad graphics, slow online play, bad mechanics, and bad AI. With all the hype this game had it was a disapointing result.
6250	0	a	ORION Dino Horde is a horrible time to be had and you will remember how terrible it is
6251	0	a	Ignore all the 'community ratings' it's still terrible.
6252	0	a	So good that they give a -91% on it. Please avoid this game.
6253	0	a	I was hoping to see a lot more Monster Hunter style personality and physics - players being circled by cautious predators who preferred to strike from behind, vehicles being tossed around, damaged or even destroyed by vicious looking charge attacks, players having to shoot the pterodactyls off of their comrade's helmets, etc.   I didn't see anything like that here. The smaller dinosaurs behaved like the pink demons from Doom and the large dinosaurs went down fast, seemed incapable of threatening the players and in general failed to express proper giant monster mannerisms. The physics could use more tweaking, the beasties could use more attacks and behavior patterns, and the players could use more danger. Knock them around some!  The netcode was mediocre. Not unplayably bad, but not awfully good, either.
6254	0	a	I have never seen a more buggy game. The menu system is so bad I had to restart the game just to get rid of the lobby select screen. This game is so bad the developers should feel bad for it.  EDIT: After 2 more attempts to join a game and having to restart the game after each failure, I am STILL not able to actually get into a game. Absolutely shameful.
6255	0	a	Guys run like they have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in their â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6256	0	a	Don't bother to try to play this game. Dino's super OP and humans eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all day. -2/11
6257	0	a	tried it on a free weekend. not worth any amount of money. (This is for dino horde, not whatever it was called before)
6258	0	a	The dinosaursurvival is Great. But the multiplayer is crap. You can't shoot anything. Your bullets go over and to the side of your enemies. I rate the multiplayer a 1-10 and the dinosaursurvival a 7-10. But it has great framerate the graphics are outstanding but the gameplay, iffy.
6259	0	a	Sloppy as hell and the network is held together by a potatoe
6260	0	a	this game could be a great ps1 game in 1998, other than that, its not worth a dollar
6261	0	a	All around, based on horrible texture qulity, aweful gameplay, and ugly, low-poly models, this game would hardly be worth free. I wouldn't waste your money, but hey, do what you want.
6262	0	a	I read some of the reviews, and watched the trailer video on the store page before trying this game our for the free weekend event. Let me tell you; Killing floor is fun..Jurassic Park is an alright movie. This game just wasn't what it was made out to be. The metascore is not misleading; it is dead on. This game rates a 3/10.
6263	0	a	Don't waste your money, don't waste any one else's money. Steer clear completely.  You have been warned.
6264	0	a	What a terrible game
6265	0	a	this game is so lagy
6266	0	a	these reviews sound an awful lot like the captions in the trailer. The game is only worth maybe a dollar... and thats all i paid. it looks and plays like a dollar phone app anyway
6267	0	a	THIS GAME IS NOT PRIMAL CARNAGE - bought it for $1, still not worth it. Super boring, super repetitive, and the multiplayer doesn't work.
6268	0	a	I know it's only .99 cents right now, and I know their video says 'zomg, don't listen to all the negative reviews because we typed this message', but... it's totally a .99 cent game. Don't get me wrong, lots of work went into it, the idea sounds awesome, the first round was great (because I thought it would have actual gameplay once I learned the ropes). But... nope.
6269	0	a	i'm glad I got this when it was a buck because I'd be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if I spend more than a dallor on this trash game. The controls are sluggish, the graphics are a joke and the overall evperience gets really boring after a few hours of playing. during matched you can upgrade your weapons and also yourself but for some reason the weapon area and the augment area are to far apart to get to both curing the cool down timer between waves. Why the hell do we have to return to 2 different building to upgrade our stuff. After a match it should be a menu you pull down and can upgrade whatever you want. I don't understand how this game has so many good reviews. dont waste your money
6270	0	a	It's like comma misuse but worse.
6271	0	a	The trick here is you have to buy the rest of the game.
6272	0	a	this game ruined my computer
6273	0	a	Imagine Halo 2 Valhalla mixed with Nazi Zombies from CoD, that's Dino Horde. And yes, you may be looking at my profile and see that I only played a half hour of the game. Well my friends, this was enough for me.  I really thought the textures and maps were well done, graphically it was a very pretty game. That was..until I heard 'Horde Incoming' or whatever. The Dinosaurs are very clunky and it doesn't feel genuine. This game mode is more of a mini-game in what should be a bigger game rather than the entirety of it.  Benefit of the doubt however lets me tell you that with some huge group of people 5-20, this game would be nuts! I was by myself, the map was way, WAY too big. But if I had 3-5 friends helping it would have been a better time.  This game is going to get a no, because I do not believe it deserves 15.00, I got it for a dollar and I still want my dollar back.
6274	0	a	This game is downright horrible, check the reviews on youtube (TotalBiscuit, Tobuscus) for the reasons why because its g.o.d.d.a.m.n awful. Played for an hour and uninstalled. Wasn't even worth my 0.99 euros.
6275	0	a	I would say this game is just bad. The sound volumes for some things are way too loud, when others are too dim. The character animations are bad, gunplay isn't that bad and movement system is somewhat nice. But still i wouldn't spend even 99 cents on this.
6276	0	a	This must have been an amazing mod back in 1996, but now it is laughable. Even the current offer of 99 cents is a waste of money.
6277	0	a	Halo one graphics mixed with turok's bulky tank like dinosaurs. can't recommend any one play this even for a dollar.
6278	0	a	Everything seems great, graphics, and everything but only problem is that there arent' enough people playing anymore which is a shame
6279	0	a	Cool concept. But very laggy.
6280	0	a	repetitive and dull
6281	0	a	i would get this game if on sale otherwise no
6282	0	a	Flung into a world of war between dinosaurs for apparently no reason, you are given no explanation whatsoever as to how to play the game; very much a 'baptism by fire' mindset. In this game, you wage war against a poorly designed AI of raptors and tiny annoying version of the same raptor... Confusing objectives and difficult to join game lobbies further the inability to grasp any sort of understanding for the game.  An concept game I would like to say were interesting, however, falls short from anything but. With a large ammount of achievements available to be unlocked, I cannot fathom the torment one would have to undergo to unlock all 251 achievements. All in all this game needs a ton of work in my mind to be even considered on the same level as an old time Star Wars Battlefront. 1/5 stars.
6283	0	a	pros: lovey graphics   cons: the game my 24 inch monitor wont fit bad sound effects i have a 5.20ghz but i still had to run it on low graphics  and the modles look terrbal thank god i got it for 99p i would love to reccmend this game but its not even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wervay sorry ;(
6284	0	a	'So cool I love it'  Yeah I bet that guy also loves â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6285	0	a	Ehhhh. Don't get me wrong. There is a lot this game does right. Mechanics are solid, the way the game lets you choose how to play is nice, however the whole thing just feels so empty. The player models are all faceless robot looking things completely devoid of personality. The dinosaurs feel less like ferocious beasts charging you down and more like carboard cut-outs that aimlessly run towards you in a race to die. There is no set up as to why these faceless robot things are committing genocide on these dinosaurs. The game is just shooting things in a box for the sake of shooting things.
6286	0	a	Game is impossible to play by yourself, there is no scaling for single player when you have a weak pistol. Trying to get into a lobby so I didnt have to play alone tried for ten minutes with no success. Glad I got it on a sale price of almost 95% off.
6287	0	a	Metacritic score is indeed deceptive, it should be lower.
6288	0	a	I figured I'd try this game out seeing as how it's on sale for $1 right now. I never got past sitting in a lobby waiting for a match to start. Clearly a reason this game is on sale for $1 right now. I'm glad I tried the free trial first before wasting a buck.
6289	0	a	Hahahaha.  Is this for real? Did I really just buy 4 copies of this game for 3 USD?  (Lemme know if you want a copy to show your kids one day.)
6290	0	a	while i only payed a dollar for the game and got more then what i payed for i have to say the reviews of improvements of this game are greatly exaggerated. the hit boxes of the dinosaurs are something even red 5 would laugh at. (infamous for hit boxes that counted necks as part of the head). the connection even with a ethernet cable was horrid. the character models are so outdated that even models from star wars clone comando look better in comparison. the store's ui is cluttered and has no way of tracking expenses for items put on a character. the taunts and various animations.... i think even hi rez put more effort into their emotes and they were free. now for the REAL gameplay.  first off i bought the LMG assuming it was a large machine gun... apparently LMG = burst rifle..... thats a simple error to fix in 30 sec.. you dont have an LMG you have a burst rifle. bow was fun but kind of impractical. (however bow weapons tend to be heavily connection dependent to be practical). using the mouse to steer the vehicles when most controls for tanks rely heavily on the wasd keys and using the mouse for turret control was aggravating (but tolerable... tom clancy games have button mapping that was worse) .  settings are set to all optional parts enabled (motion blur, bloom, etc) and high settings. disabling most of the optional settings makes the game playable but connectivty issues and wonky hitboxes are never good for a game no matter how pretty.  the hats.... just.... just no.... i mean if the hat replaced the helmet instead of being on top of it maybe .... other wise... no. even tf2 knows better then to allow clipping of cosmetic items.  however.... this game isnt something from the bowls of hell.... its kind of a fun idea though i was never into being a sci fi dinosaur killer and this game has raised a slight interest. I also have to give props to the developer still putting the time and effort to at least try to make the game better. something we dont see enough of these days in an age where companies like hi rez and activision make a game cash the paycheck for a year then abandon it for a new project in a different genre.  In fact id love to see this game on a new engine with updated charcter models.... and working hit boxes -_-....and a more intuitive UI.  people are arguing its worthy of an 83 or an 80 on the meta critic score... after my expereince that is not the case. the game has definitely made steps forward from the 30 it originally received but not worthy of a 82. this game id have to say a 63 would be a much more accurate score of the game. its no triple A title and with a setting such as sci fi soldiers killing dinosaurs i already had low expectations... which surprised me in good ways and bad as well. there are large areas for improvement just to make the game a 75 worthy score and even an hour of gameplay is enough to see that. it was fun for a dollar and i hope it gets put into their next project. these guys have a nice idea.... just need to do a bit better job of executing it.   if ya got a spare buck give it a shot for a couple hours have a little derpy fun.... and never speak of it again. 
6291	0	a	Ha, not even for a dollar.  You can rebrand the same piece of crap over and over again, but if you don't overhaul it, it's just going to remain crap.
6292	0	a	This game was worth the $0.75 I paid for it.
6293	0	a	This game is the most broken, unfinished, rushed unattractive game ive ever played, the controls are broken and in many cases..just start huffing paint and stop working completely, multiple crashes, barely rendered textures and an atmosphere that makes me want to place a colt 44 revolver in my mouth and squeeze the trigger, never ever EVER buy this game...theres a reason it was 92% off...  Just go play turok, it works its pretty, and it doesnt make me feel like a 4 year old with a disability.
6294	0	a	i am an idiot for spending a dollar on this game, which means a lot
6295	0	a	Dont buy this, not worth it.
6296	0	a	Just another game that doesn't take itself seriously. Could be fun with friends, just to enjoy shooting at dinosaurs and see them chewing on human-made machines (?) Not great, not bad, if you're into Jurassic Park check it out.
6297	0	a	what a boring game.
6298	0	a	I haven't played beatdown, but this is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. While Dino Horde has potential, it falls short of even decent expectations. Fighting dinosaurs has never been so dull. A shame, since it's evident that the developers put a lot of time into it... it's just too bad they didn't focus on making it fun.
6299	0	a	For $1, I was pretty disappointed.
6300	0	a	This game is suck don't buy it even for 1$, bad graphisme, bugged, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gameplay, nobody on the servers, run away from this game. I know the team try to correct that, but failed miserably, there are so much bug that i don't want to listed them. If you want dino game play primal carnage. I confirmed is 32/100, too bad, the idea is cool but exploited in better game. P.S: sorry for bad english i'm french.
6301	0	a	Worst game ever. I paid 15p and still feel disappointed.
6302	0	a	Monotonous and boring. Glad I only paid 99 cents for it
6303	0	a	The sequel to Battlefield 3 that we've all be waiting for.
6304	0	a	I bought Pulsar: Lost Colony. It was accidentally released to the public in a non-working pre alpha state. Pulsar was more entertaining than this. The Video says something to the tune of 'Ignore the metacritic score. The devs listened to us and made this game better.' If this is better, I can't imagine the state it was in before. Who designed the levels? What's the point of spawning over a kilometer away from your DEFEND OBJECTIVE? You can't even set up stationary defenses along the way. You literally have to spend 5 minutes makin the trek to your base, or get lucky and stumble upon a vehicle. WHY????
6305	0	a	Dont waste your money on this trash game!
6306	0	a	Horribly unpolished and dull FPS, weapons just don't feel like they are firing bullets - opponents don't really react to being fired at, their AI is horrible and the whole combat feels boring. Map design is pretty good though, large areas, vehicles, mechs and everything - it has the potential to be a great game but it just isn't right now. I don't recommend buying it right now, maybe later when it gets a big expansion pack or something.
6307	0	a	Lags, frame drops, black screen, crashes, sound skipping. And dinosaurs. 30 euro? Are you crazy? This is hardly a beta, I'd say it's an alpha edition, not a final product. Yup, my PC meets the minimal technical requirements.  I do NOT recommend that you buy this game.
6308	0	a	Average not my type of game but .... Average
6309	0	a	I felt i was playing the first halo but with dinosaurs which doesn't sound bad at all. When i actually played the game i realized i was wrong. The game never really seems to go anywhere and after a few matches feels old. Its like heres some guns now go shoot some dinosaurs! But even then, the dinosaurs only rush your position and the only needed strategy needed is to walk backwards and spray. Im glad I didn't pay the full price for this because i would have been seriously disappointed.
6310	0	a	Don't play it, it's bad, trust me..Despite being warned by a friend I thought I should give the game a try..Within the first 10 second my impression was: AWFUL. Textures are far from even an average 'standard' quality for PC...Guns feels weird, hard to aim, horrible sound and also feel weight less..FOV is low, makes you motion sick and nope, you can't adjust it.
6311	0	a	Pro: I get to shoot dinosaurs. Con: Dinosaurs do not shoot lasers back Con: Can not play as laser shooting dinosaur.
6312	0	a	This is very good game,I played and i like it
6313	0	a	Lmao Ill tell you right now the games not even worth $14.99, I was given the game by a friend a while ago when it first came out. After the first like 15 mins I uninstalled because it was garbage. I came back just a little while ago because I seen they changed it since then and what not. No its still garbage. I almost bought it for 2 of my friends for the $ 0.99 however I didnt feel like it would be played much and would be a waste of $2 which i could go and get a soda or something better then this game. It looks amazing looks like it would be a lot of fun and maybe it is? but I just can not stand the graphics, the animations, or the gameplay myself.
6314	0	a	Buggy gameplay, sticky dinosaurs, horrible dino control. 10/10. will never play again.
6315	0	a	Ya know. I was going to buy it. I really was. I somehow got a free trial of it and had a lot of fun playing it. I was going to buy it while it was on sale last night, but since I already had it, it wouldn't let me get it. So I go to buy it today and I conveniently can't play it now because it's back to it's original price. This is absolute bull crap. I was going to buy it! I was going to pay, but I COULDN'T. THE GAME IS FUN! But because of the way this sale went down, I can't say that I'd recommend it. If I had the money, I'd get it before hand. But now?
6316	0	a	though this game is filled with great graphics and dinosaurs, this game is full of glitches and crashes, not to mention if your playing with friends it takes forever to find a server for your friends to play on and even creating a server for the host it lags out , I just got this game and it asks me to buy it AGAIN ! well i wont this is a lesson to all of you dont waste your money like I did !
6317	0	a	This isn't a good game, but for a 99 cent sale I could consider buying it then. But not for 15 freaking dollars.
6318	0	a	It's the most laggyest game ever my friend and I have ok gaming computers but we cant walk 10 feet i don't like it because of the massive lag (ONLY REALLY GOOD COMPUTERS CAN PLAY THIS GAME)
6319	0	a	It's not the worst game Ive ever played but by far from the best. If you buy it while it's on sale for a buck, it's worth the dollar. However don't get your hopes up. The survival mode is a lot like Killing Floor. Kill dinosaurs and earn money. Use the money to buy guns and upgrades. Survive the wave and go to the next one. The dinosaurs are pretty lame but overall, it's ok.
6320	0	a	This is honestly the best game I have ever played. It has a dynamic combination of fps, driving over annoying tiny dinosaurs, and having your ear drums burst from the roars of T-Rexes. Stunning, stunning graphics are complimented by utter emersion. Bloom so intense that you literally can't see anything is probably my favorite feature of this game. GAME OF THE YEAR RIGHT HERE!    Just kidding this game is terrible.
6321	0	a	HORIBLE i dont understand why anyone would bye this game. Its crap on a cracker mixed with soggy bread thats been put on a pancake that has been burnt and then shuger coated to look tasty.DO NOT BUY i got it for free for 4 days and played it for about on hour it realy showed what it wanted to do but didint do it right. BUT IT REALLY MAKES ME MAD THAT I HAVE BEEN WANTING A GAME THAT DOSE THIS RIGHT the FPS wave defens game is like a dream of mine and to see it here kinda makes me want to cry. T_T
6322	0	a	this game blows.. no wonder it was for a dollar..
6323	0	a	Why make people pay for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when you bought this? It is really hard to see that, just like all the servers that I can't join because of a refreshing bug that stopped my game.  Good detail, just needs bug fixes out the â™¥â™¥â™¥
6324	0	a	Do not find going circles at a high rate of speed entertaining.
6325	0	a	If there was an actual strategy to the game, then I'd recommend it. But this is just a wave of a dozen dinosaurs running toward you or a specific waypoint, and you shoot them. The map looks huge, but since the dinosaurs only want to attack the one location, and there's only a minute between waves, and there are upgrades to buy at two very inconveniently-located locations, I'm not sure how anyone is meant to see more of the map.
6326	0	a	BAD!! not worth the $.99 nor the hard drive space.
6327	0	a	Generic multiplayer gameplay with subpar graphics and awkward animations.
6328	0	a	WoW!!! no wonder this was under $1. This is a UDK game (not the Unreal engine) stand alone, arena PvP game. You stand there and wait for endless spawns of dino's to come destroy your generator....you kill them, repair, rinse and repeat, over and over and over and over.....
6329	0	a	Not even for a dollar will I re-download this game. I played it the last time it went F2P, and... even though I played it for free I hated it. It took me and a friend a solid twenty minutes to even get a match going, and not because we couldn't access any servers. Ohhhh no. The game is really just that slow. The interface really isn't user-friendly at all either. The main menu is buggy.  Once you're actually in the game, you'll realize very quickly that the game is a very dry shooter/tower defense. It's not fun, but in fact it is very aggravating. On the surface, the game looks super fun. 'Why did Metacritic score this so low?' I asked myself. 'It doesn't look that bad.' It's bad. All enemeies basically have the same attack. And worst of all, the game is so blatantly repetitive.   Despite what the screenshots led us to believe, the game's graphics were some of the crappiest we've seen. While I myself do not have a higher end computer, my friend did. And even for him, the game looked like crap.  Honestly, I do like the concept of the game. What's not to love about shooting dinosaurs on an alien world? I really wanted to like this game. I really did. But it was just so boring. If the developers can fix it up a bit, then I will gladly try again. But for now, save your dollar for something else.
6330	0	a	Jesus Christ, why did I buy this game. Now I'm stuck with three other copies that I can't even get rid of.
6331	0	a	Even for 1â‚¬ this game is pretty crappy.  - full of bugs - gameplay feels cheap - game mechanics are boring - graphics look even worse than the screenshots on the store page (expect something like Playstation 2) - ugly and unintuitive menus  Consider buying Natural Selection 2 instead - it is far far better than this piece of crap!
6332	0	a	I'm glad I only paid $0.99 for it.
6333	0	a	After trying this game on a steam two day pass I decided even at the sale price of 99p it wasn't worth it, the game is fun to play however you get randomly dropped from games without warning and you spend most of your time in a match making lobby. Very frustrating.
6334	0	a	i think this game is good but he is rly boring after 2 days so from 15 bux is come to 1 bux so i knew that day will come but im no t buying the game hope that you have more good games  
6335	0	a	Bleargh
6336	0	a	sucks. dont buy it
6337	0	a	Putrid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ juice courtesy of Spiral Game Studios. This game is buggy as hell, they're apparently releasing another game on Kickstarter- FINISH THIS FIRST FOR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥S SAKE! They're most likely gonna do the same with their new game, release an unfinished product and squeeze the money out of people. Oh yeah, and the only thing that is functional is the store and payment options...
6338	0	a	A big stinking pile of crap.
6339	0	a	This is my personal opinion but I thought that the game was poor. It might be different for other people but I found that the graphics were not great and some of the animations just plain stupid. I did not enjoy the game as it just got boring after a while and would not recommend it. The only thing that I have played similar to it would be extinction from COD Ghosts and I didn't highly rate that either. I think that one can tell quite a lot about this game by the fact that it has a 92% price reduction to Â£0.99. Same price as an app on aphone and about the same quality.
6340	0	a	Even at 0.99p and on free week it has barely 20 players on it, Plagued by various issues, lacking support for certain resolutions and half complete game modes. Orion: Dino Horde isn't worth your time or money, it is fun for the first 10 minutes but after that you realise its many shortcomings. Meanwhile overambitious developer is planning more and more things when the foundation of the game is still unpolished.   Also the Playable dinosaur game mode is rarely played and fustrating.   It is a shame, i wanted this game to be great. It isn't and considering how long it has taken + a name change, i very much doubt it'll be anything worth playing for years to come.
6341	0	a	Bought it in 2012, played it in 2012, tried it again today. This game still does not deserve the bad metascore. It does not deserve 36 points. It deserves far less. It still sucks.
6342	0	a	UPDATE: Noticed that horrible netcode is really horrible when not being the host.  TL;DR: Don't bother. Worth the dollar, not worth the full price.  So I thought I'd buy this game as it was crazy cheap, so I wouldn't lose much anyways in case it sucked. Turns out it kinda does, but it's still fun. The game is incredibly trashy, but that's not really a valid point to criticise as that kind of comes with the 'Dinosaur FPS' genre. It's so trashy, it even has bullet time. (You can create lobbies without it though, but why would you?)  Basic Gameplay Elements ====================  Basically, it's a wave-based co-operative horde mode against various types of dinosaurs. Waves are not all of the same type though, some are simple survival, others require you to capture an objective. (You will be rewarded with vehicles for doing so)  During the wave, you'll collect credits for killing dinosaurs, and killing them in rapid succession gives you a multiplier, so getting good streaks is actually important to earn money for upgrades and weapons. Upgrades appear to be interesting for the most part, there are some boring 'do twice as much damage' upgrades, which I don't think should be there.  Inbetween waves, you're able to purchase upgrades at your base. The time between rounds is pretty short though (one minute), and the buildings are not always placed in a way that allows you to purchase weapons and upgrades during that short interval. You have a teleporter to beam you back to the base, at least, but in some maps, the base is pretty spread out. Furthermore, some dinosaurs seem to spawn inbetween waves.  Apart from smaller, easier to kill dinos, big ones will occasionally spawn, and as long as those live, more smaller ones will spawn. However, the game tells you when it does so, and also informs you about the health of the big dinosaurs, which makes things a bit easier.  There are three classes in the game, and two of them seem to be completely useless because the first one has a jetpack. The jetpack is pretty useful to avoid getting eaten by Dinosaurs, and is more of a lifesaver than any medic gun ever will be.  Teamplay is not all that important. Having someone repair the generator before it goes offline is nice but barely an issue most of the time. If you manage to die, you'll go into a borderlands-style last-stand, where you can revive yourself by killing an enemy. Teammates can revive you aswell, either by holding down E for a while or healing you with a medic gun.  Criticisms ========  There are things in the game that are legitimately crappy, which do affect the enjoyment. Guns feel â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, mostly because recoil is unbiased and pretty much random, but also due to bad sound assets and cheap animations. The latter two are probably due to budget constraints, but the former is not really excusable. Vehicle guns have such a huge cone of fire that they're pretty useless altogether. Most guns seem to not be hitscan, however, which is a good thing, as it adds some much needed depth to the gunplay.  Furthermore, the game has plenty of glitches. While the Dinosaur AI is not completely braindead at times and tries to make it hard for you to hit them, they occasionally get stuck, or just run at you in a straight line while you're running backwards, making it easy for you to shoot them. Physics seem to bug out at times (buggy physics seem to be a common trope in dinosaur games, remember Trespasser?), but not in a way that really affects gameplay. It's mostly limited to corpses breakdancing on the ground.  Graphics seem good for a budget title, that is until you take a closer look at the textures, the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ animations. That is, if you can even see those over the ridiculous amounts of bloom and occasional motion blur. I'm sure those can be toggled off, however, but that means you'll see more of the low-res textures and weird animations.  Dinosaur animations seem to suffer from the same quality issues, and they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out a bit when you sit on a cliff that they can't reach. Speaking of cliffs that they can't reach: This is where the jetpack really comes in handy, because it allows you to escape from anything that isn't a pterodactyle, or doesn't have a ranged attack.  The netcode seems to have some issues aswell. Other players rubberband around almost always, as there seems to be almost no movement prediction for players. Unless you are the host, the game will be extremely laggy, and not much fun to play.  Conquest gamemode appears to be a more boring Survival gamemode, so I have no clue what that is all about.  The microtransactions don't seem to interfere with the game and appear to just be cosmetic, but I still think they shouldn't be in the game at all.  Conclusion ========  Definitely worth the price during the sale. If you've been waiting for a game that lets you hunt T-Rexes with a bow while flying around with a jetpack, then this is your game. I'm not sure if it's worth the full price though. Most likely not. And the bad netcode ultimately kills it.
6343	0	a	This game is really bad, dont even bother downloading it
6344	0	a	Why do I even own this?
6345	0	a	The idea behind the game is good, but when the game crashes all the time while the interface doesnt work it makes it a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Time and time again i tried to get in to the game but crash after chrash makes it realy hard to like it. And when you have to empty your guns for ammo to obtain the last kill, because the AI is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and has lodged itself on a cliffside 500 meters away, it kind of fells like you have been had.
6346	0	a	Gets boring very quickly, no variation when re-playing a particular game mode. Just the same every. single. time. The new conquest gamemode is pretty much the same as survival.. kinda a let down.
6347	0	a	This is the game was the first I can recall where got the worse case of motion sickness.
6348	0	a	Um... It's uh... ok? Kinda buggy... um... yeah this game isn't so great. It's funny to play though.
6349	0	a	buggy. Free game for this week, but you cannot connect to any of the games in progress, nor can you start your own game. Poor game, poor execution, no connectivity. Why is this game even here?
6350	0	a	Its Terrible, I had it when it was orion dino:beatdown. It is one of three games i would happily request steam to remove of my library but then i see it as an example to use to ensure i don't buy crap like this in the future.
6351	0	a	Game sucked BAD.  I wouldn't buy it for a buck.  First off *texture pop in*, Gun animations don't work, terrible AI, vehicle controls are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and its a rip off of killing floor just with dinos..
6352	0	a	It's a fun game, at least that's what I've lead to believe from the trailer. The matchmaking is so terrible that I haven't been able to play in.
6353	0	a	Unadvertised multiplayer only. Nope.
6354	0	a	I paid a pound.  That was too much for this 'game'.
6355	0	a	The Metascore was a little too nice for this putrid excuse for a game. I thought 'Oh, a dollar? Why not? All the reviews are good'. Never have I been so mistaken. I should have listened to the Metascore and avoided it at all costs. But no. I managed to find 2 reasons why anyone should play this game. 2. It has dinosaurs. You can shoot them. That is it. The game is buggy, poorly optimized, ugly, confusing, and utterly broken. The textures look like pixel art, the models look like somebody cut a bit out of a metal tube, your characters feet are square, the frame rate must be locked at something really low because no matter what graphics settings I put them as, it still looked laggy and unresponsive, the guns have no feedback to them, menus barely work, game crashes most times I try to join a multiplayer game and from what I saw, I'm not the only one with this problem, trees look like trash, dinosaurs look like trash, UI looks like trash, vehicles are weak and the turrets do no damage, massive server issues, NO CONTROLLER SENSITIVITY, poor M/KB controls, long â™¥â™¥â™¥ walks, useless augments, overpriced weapons, and I can just go on and on about how terrible this game is. DON'T. BUY IT. DON'T! THIS GAME IS BROKEN. Steam needs better quality control. I really hope someone reads this and knows not to buy this waste of time, money and hard drive space.
6356	0	a	Paid .99 cents for this I still feel ripped off.
6357	0	a	honestly for $0.99 cents its not terrible if you only play the horde mode were you and a couple others mindlessly shoot dinosaurs. game is very buggy, the recoil from shooting a gun is FAR from smooth, almost gives me a headache. Like others said the concept is great but not worth more than $0.99 cents (on sale right now). Very repeatitive too.
6358	0	a	I wanted to like this game. It looks fun, and it looks like the developers put a lot of work into fixing all of the things that were previously broken. Unfortunately, it just wouldn't launch. I tried everthing - twice. I respect a dev that can recognize that their game is broken, and take steps to fix it, but it looks like they've still got problems to solve.
6359	0	a	This game is laggy, overall was a poor experience.  Wasn't worth the dollar I paid.
6360	0	a	Worth exactly a dollar. Though, the game has many tweaks graphics wise, there would be more fun in having different game modes and some mods for jeebus sakes. 
6361	0	a	Played it for about an hour a few months ago. Uninstalled because it was boring as hell and there was only 1 active server. Might try it again with the new update at some point.
6362	0	a	What a stupid game
6363	0	a	THIS GAME IS AWFUL NOT EVEN WORTH 99 cents , the animations are awful almost all of the weapons , vehicles and structures are blatent halo ripoffs (how did they not get sued over this) gameplay is laggy at best , the best part of this game is laughing about how bad it is, an the trailer for this with all the fake quotes and reviews , pathetic , Dont support this s#*@
6364	0	a	I feel like i bought a 1$ packet of chips WIHOUT CHIPS IN IT!  Quite simply: I CANNOT PLAY IT! ... It's BROKEN! I haven't been able to connect to any servers and when I do, the game crashes!   Why do they even try to sell this game?! Do they seriously expect to make money this way?! Have they even tried the game before selling it?!
6365	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. It's just terrible. I can't even imagine how awful it was before if this is the greatly improved version.
6366	0	a	wow....everything about this game is just poor.
6367	0	a	this game is poop. i would write a longer review, but i lost brain cells playing it.
6368	0	a	The Metacritic scores are wrong, the trailer is correct. This game deserves MUCH LESS than a 36 out of 100. I spent one dollar on this game thinking that I was bound to get at least an hour of positive gameplay out it. I can't even muster that. Do not buy this game, please, for the sake of all that is sacred please believe me. The game is broken in every sense of the word. Do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars, do not spend one dollar on ORION: Dino Horde.
6369	0	a	No, I do not recommend this game IF it is above 0.99 USD. Let me start by saying this, this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks BUT i enjoy the hell out of it because it has always been my fantasy to kick dinosaur â™¥â™¥â™¥ with guns. The grenade physics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor, the Dinosaur attack animations are very stale and awkward. The list of reasons why this game sucks is too long for me to put here but if it's 0.99 cents and you like kicking dinosaur â™¥â™¥â™¥ and don't care wether its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game or not, buy this game.  If not, don't.
6370	0	a	This game is really good. Don't let the bad reviews fool you it's just as good as a game about shooting dinosaurs sounds. First of all the game has dinosaurs, second, there's enough to be a veritable HORDE of dinosaurs. What more do you want? Gameplay? Check, there's definitely something you could call gameplay here. Music? Okay so I don't remember whether or not there's any music but if it's there, I'm sure it's fantastic. What more could you expect from the developers of such classics as... Okay well they haven't made anything else, but if they did, I'm sure it would be just as good as this. In conclusion, if you weren't aware, this review was satirical, and you shouldn't play this game, except as a joke. Seriously this game blows.
6371	0	a	kinda got buyres remorse and i only paid 0.99 usd. really lame graphics and terible in game controlls aswell overall game play
6372	0	a	I played for 2 mins, mostly with the Game's options. The only thumbstick layout is default. You can invert the thumbstick by reversing the mouse, but there's no way to switch to legacy which is my control setup of choice. For me, this is an automatic fail for any modern first person shooter.
6373	0	a	RUN RUN, WHATEVER YOU DO, RUN! WHERE IS THE MECH? NOT HERE! THIS GAME ISNT EVEN WORTH THE $1 THAT IT COSTS AND THE TIME IT TAKES TO INSTALL. WHAT EVER YOU DO, DONT BLINK, BLINK AND YOUR BORED.
6374	0	a	Wow this game is a mess. It won't run. I've spend 45 minutes of 'play time' and have never been able to play the game.
6375	0	a	This game may have been really fun when I bought it, as it felt like a mix between Halo and turox, but it just doesn't have enough content to keep me, or my friends, interested. Only buy this if you know you are going to like it.
6376	0	a	This game is terrible, it has massive maps with nothing in them. Spawning you, at times, 5 minutes away from the objective (the only point where hostiles spawn). it is also extremely glitchy.
6377	0	a	Its like halo but with dinosaurs and hats etc. 4/10
6378	0	a	Good graphics but gameplay is too bad :/
6379	0	a	I did not like it at all. Wooden animations + bugs = massacre
6380	0	a	Good concept; sorry execution. Played for an hour and wanted out for an hour. Not recommended.
6381	0	a	costs money, bad
6382	0	a	Lousy! Difficuly to play! don't waste your time!
6383	0	a	Constant conection problems. no tutorial. I very much regret ever playing this game.
6384	0	a	While I appreciate their 'Hey, it's not as bad as the reviews say!' trailer, this game is pretty much as bad as the reviews say.
6385	0	a	cuase its ot free anymore jk
6386	0	a	not really worth it except during 90% sale
6387	0	a	Bought at release. Still garbage.
6388	0	a	Ah seh NO!!! Just like Marvel Heroes! you decide to release an update and expect me to download the aWHOL EFREAKING 2 GB INSTALL FILE AGAIN?!?!?!   AH.... SEHHHH.... NOOOOOO!!!!!!
6389	0	a	This game is abysmal. Even at $.99 its not worth it. Your better off clogging your arteries with a dollar menu cheeseburger with that money.
6390	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IT LAGS ALOT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS
6391	0	a	It doesn't seem to be a finished game, it isn't worth the price (I got it for less than a dollar).
6392	0	a	Don't buy this game, it's terrible.
6393	0	a	Ugh...
6394	0	a	Since i bought this game, like 2 weeks ago, i try to played it for the first time when i finish buying the game. Then when i try to played it it just stuck in loading and i think when its stuck its become not responding, So i waste my money for this game. that time the price was $15
6395	0	a	I wanted to like this game. i did. but the poor explanation of game modes, the very unbalanced gameplay and generally lack of any resource to explain either has made me have to not recommend this game. If the devs actually do something to help new players get into the game, i may change this but for now i have to say DO NOT GET THIS GAME! even for 99 cents its not worth it till they make a effort to explain this game to new users.
6396	0	a	This game made my physically ill, the camera is godawful.
6397	0	a	Do not believe positive reviews of this game. Nothing works right, nothing makes sense, you get stuck in between the largest of gaps, and it sure as hell ain't nothing like Turok OR Killing Floor.  It is awful and it only survives from sales.
6398	0	a	Sadly, not worth the $0.99. The positive reviews are misleading. Rely on the metacritic score.
6399	0	a	Horrible design, Takes too long to reload while being swarmed, Not a game anyone should play a rip off of Killing Floor. Killing floor is better then this in every way
6400	0	a	it is bum
6401	0	a	Would not be a bad game if you could turn the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing t-rex roar down! I have the game damn near muted and it still is too fing loud.
6402	0	a	I got through eighteen minutes of this so called 'experience/game' I am now throwing up and was perscribed zanex, my liver has failed and my heart stopped 8.72 times. Please for the love of god save some eergy from the defribulators and skip this peice of crap title. 3/9001
6403	0	a	Supposedly vastly improved compared to how it once was, but based on the number of glitches I've encountered in a short space of time, and the garbage AI, there's still a lot this game needs to improve upon.   I wouldn't recommend this game as it is right now, but the developers seem committed and, given time, this could prove to be a very solid game.
6404	0	a	All I can say is wow! If this is an improvement, I would hate to see what this game was like before they 'fixed' it! Laggy, clipping, terrible game. Believe the bad reviews.
6405	0	a	what can i say about this pile of dino feces uhh i see why it was 86cents
6406	0	a	It's nothing spectacular. Not much information about the weapons and upgrades, barest amount of direction in what you're doing. For the base price, it is not worth it but if you can find it on sale, it's worth a few hours of entertainment if you have some friends.
6407	0	a	I didn't find this game appealing. Even for a buck.
6408	0	a	If i had a bag of T-Rex poop and this game, i'd probably eat the poop.
6409	0	a	Dude Malic. Why are you inflicting this aids on people?
6410	0	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6411	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, its awful. I'm guessing the reviews are fake accounts from the developer. This game is one of the worst I've ever played. It is a laggy low resolution mess. The controls are unresponsive, probably due to the laggy game play, and its just well terrible. The audio is generic, the guns don't have any feeling to them, the vehicles don't feel right. Nothing has any impact, and I mean nothing. Even being stomped by a huge dinosaur just flings you across the map. You won't know when that will happen because you won't see any animation for it, so just don't get close...Also, like big guns on vehicles, well be perpared to not shoot them for about 10 seconds and then have them start shooting after you clicked your mouse button 4 or 5 times.... Basically this whole game just doesn't feel right.
6412	0	a	Lulz this game is garbage. Only cost $1.00 so there is that.
6413	0	a	meh a boring game and barely any empty survers ugh bured
6414	0	a	Don't Buy it Don't Try it!
6415	0	a	Absolutely not worth a dollar because I would never play this more than the once. There is no way the game even indicates when you damage the dinos. It seems like they released this after it was 50% complete in the dev process. DO NOT BUY THIS. Natural Selection 2 is a much better alternative to ODH with better gun and monster play that feels like a fast paced shooter should.
6416	0	a	Absoluteley terrible, but a good laugh.
6417	0	a	the opening video is the best thing to this game
6418	0	a	I can see why this game is so cheap. Its freaking horrible.
6419	0	a	Poor, thats all i have to say. The reviews looked good until you actually play. Everything is mixed up, you run out of ammo way to fast. Dont listen to the trailer or watch it. It builds you up to take you back down. I didnt play the original one so I cant imagine how bad that was. If they made any improvement it wasent seen. while i was playing proplr where just raging on how bad this game is. Once again poor game. Now I understand why it was 93% off on steam... terrible job.
6420	0	a	So,  I really wanted to like this game, I really did, however there are some blatant gameplay and design issues that made this game one of the most frustrating and least enjoyable multiplayer games I have played.  TL;DR: controls were unbearable, FOV(1st, 3rd person cameras were rough, even worse playing as a dinosaur), Some of the maps we (my dinosaur team) were getting stuck on TREES and BUSHES, completely frustrating, maps had poor gameplay flow and design, Just over all i feel the game play mechanics need a lot of love before this game should even hit the market, there's alot of things going on in this game that makes me feel like either the studio didn't playtest this internally to address obvious issues in design and gameplay, or they simply didn't follow through with fixing it.  Sorry Spiral, but please playtest the crap out of your game, and figure out your game play mechanics to support the game you're trying to make and sell.  Long version:   The first run was through a 5 man survival mode, the FOV felt wrong for it being an FPS. After a round i got somewhat accustomed to it. At some point during the second round, i got booted out to the lobby- no feedback as to why...it just happened. I immediately reconnected back to the same server (as it was still listed on the server list) and loaded to my camera/screen looking at the level..underground. The game wasn't locked up per-se, but i entered a bugged state, where no controls were responsive leaving me with to terminate the program through my processes menu.   I then tried 2 rounds of the Rampage game mode, and was surprised to find out i could play as a Dinosaur. Unfortunately i was immediately greeted upon spawning as a stegosaurus that the 3rd person Camera while playing was covered by about 2/3rds of the dinosaur character model. I literally was mostly seeing spines. I was slow as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and had no idea where i was going or where my opponents where. I could go on and on about the issues with this game both gameplay wise and design...Even for a dollar, i could NOT convince myself to buy it, and within that time i removed my FB post to my friends seeing if they wanted to pick it.  
6421	0	a	Super buggy. Super boring. Seemed like a good idea drunk, but even at only $0.99 I weep for every lost penny.
6422	0	a	This is still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, played this a couple times, its plays nothign like the videos, save your time
6423	0	a	I went in expecting little and was not surprised.  Gameplay: One-sided. Humans are often spawn-camped because the dinosaurs can 3-shot you. The only class worth half a breath is the recon, where you can use stealth to confuse your enemy. Otherwise, consider the dino's kits (8 or more classes compared to 3) more useful. Though, you can count on the dinosaurs to handle like a tennis ball coated in Elmer's glue. Even the raptors turn like a buick. Also, no built-in auto-balancing for teams. It would make sense if, say, 5 humans vs 3 dinos, but there's no regulator. Interface: Okay, I guess. Everything can be found somewhere. Not amazing, not terrible. Works, though. But it should... it's technically a 'release'... right? Graphics &amp; Sound: I read somewhere on another review that the guns sounded like shrill shreeky something somethings. Yeah, they're kind of obnoxious. I had 'hit marker' sounds turned on and I couldn't even tell when they were going off. Really felt kind of low-grade from the sound quality. Graphics? Nothing to shake a stick at. Environment is 'arena-esque', but plenty of foliage. Sprinting 'depth of field' is horribly proportioned. and overall, smaller things can get lost in the background 'haze'. Multiplayer: Imbalanced, clunky, and unpolished. Lack of damage feedback or immediate training/descriptions left me more to explore and see how horribly ineffective anything was, rather than go in with at least a baseline understanding of strengths/weaknesses. Stability: Yeah, servers are crashing randomly (don't know if it just means the host left or something) and I tried to play solo play and immediately crashed. I decided at that point that it wasn't worth my time.  [[Would not recommend.]] May be worth looking back at when it gets patched a few times, but I don't believe in supporting game companies that ask their player base for a high amount of coping with shortcomings at release and then making up for it later. There's no need to play with an emotional investment as well as a financial one.
6424	0	a	Honestly this game is bad, I played 2 games and whilst i had some fun and some aspects like the vechiles or large gun selection but ALL that is meaningless when the game has HUGE holes. Visually this game has loads to love and they have added a lot of content but the weapons don't feel good and animations aren't smooth, try standing still and you will see the raptors slowlly go for a munch when they stand infront of you and then all that happens is the screen gets a little red. Compare that to a game like COD or maybe a good COOP survival like Killing Floor, the gun sounds in those games feel meaty and powerful and when someone sttacks you the whole animation flows, people don't stop moving and then move one arm with a knife whilst the rest of their body stays perfectly still, that is what the dinosaurs do. When you take damage in COD the screen would shake, you would hear grunts and a quick splash of red on the screen in the form of blood would appear. this is why this game feels so dull to me, no wieght to actions. Also mechanicly its dull, with dino's that just run at you and then a couple tanky ones where is the strategic puzzle? I dont know, it just seems to be shooting or driving.
6425	0	a	this game is so so so bad!!!
6426	0	a	this game is decent, not good though. there are some glitches i'v seen on the first online game i did, and it was so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad that we had to quit the game and restart. i only can recommend this game if it is on sale.
6427	0	a	Saddle up for the mediocre experience of a life time! Round up some friends, hunt some mentally challenged dinosaurs or compete with friends to see who is better with the staple gun.
6428	0	a	Please dont waste your money in this game. The mechanics sucks...if playing as a soldier sucks, playing as a dinosaur really...REALLY SUCKS. Save your money!
6429	0	a	Terrible â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game. Worst â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game I've ever â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing played.
6430	0	a	Worse than bad rats.
6431	0	a	I have not seen a game with such bad animations in a while. Also the menus are glitched for me, so any model of my character/etc is vertically stretched and mostly offscreen. The HUD is entirely unintuitive, and I have been constantly disconnected. I can't critique the gameplay, since I have only barely been able to interact with the game, given the issues.  That being said, I've only played this game for a very short amount of time, so maybe with further attempts I will find redeemable qualities to it.
6432	0	a	you will get more entertainment from burning money than playing this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6433	0	a	Played this game while it was free. Only got as far as level 8. For a free game it's not too bad I suppose. It sports very dull environments, buggy textures, weak vehicles, repetative gameplay, and not really anything redeeming about it. While it's on sale I think $0.99 is asking too much, there are better free to play shooters on here. For the full $14.99 price you would be better off passing on this completely. I assume the free time and dollar price is to attract people so they can advertise that they are going to be kickstarting a new game. They probably should put more work into this one before going on to another one.
6434	0	a	This game...gave me cancer....soo very very bad.
6435	0	a	It's so bad it's good. It really could have been so much more, but it just fell short of most of those goals. Also an SOS to anyone out there: I have 2 copies of the game sitting in my inventory looking all filthy and stuff. If anyone, ANYONE wants to get the game for free, it's better than spending $15 or even $1.
6436	0	a	What??? You have to buy even your basic gear. Not even once.
6437	0	a	awful glitchy animations maps are too big and repetitive i would even say it isn't worth a dollar which is the price it goes on sale for every few weeks AI is terrible i got stuck in objects
6438	0	a	ME: 'Yeah, it has some negative reviews, but for a Dollar how could I go wrong....'  I could justify with a reason for every single cent of my dollar, why this game IS NOT worth it. I don't know how I can look my friends in the eyes again after buying a 4 pack and giving my other copies to them, I would have been better off â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in a box and giving it to them as gifts. Even for free, the few minutes of your life this game will take away from you forever is too great of a price to pay.  Assuming, like me, you DON'T like clunky piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games with terrible graphics, no AI, horrible maps, bad glitches and a terrible concept that offer NO enjoyment for the player on any level, even as a joke, I am going to go ahead and recommend you DON'T GET THIS. If I hadn't already wasted too much of my life on this game, I would detail all of it's shortfalls here for you, but I dont have the hours or patience it would require.  If you do like any or all of the things mentioned above, then get this game, it has all of them in abundance and you will not be disappointed.
6439	0	a	i love the dinosaurs and the jetpacks also
6440	0	a	laggy, cheaply made, and poorly designed gaming mechanics. it still deserves its metascore.
6441	0	a	Do you like seeing Dinosaurs?  Well if you're going to play this game you better â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing like seeing dinosaurs because literally everything else about it is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6442	0	a	It feels liek one of those shoot em up games at an arcade. The graphics are definatly NOT next gen. But I will give it the credit of being an independant game. Its not bad, it just needs some work. first priority should be graphics. Then work on the enemy AI's.
6443	0	a	There's a reason they let us play this game for free.......
6444	0	a	WOW. What a steaming pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! I mean... WOW. As I write this, It's on sale for a dollar, and I can't even justify 100 pennies toward this mess. Just a hot mess. Garbled, unattractive textures, really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-poor gunplay, the least threatening dinosaurs you can imagine (save for the Compsognathuses which are impossible the see until they are nibbling at you knees [and, IRL, you could just stomp on these things and kill them by the way]). It is an amazing hot mess. Do not be suckered in by the low price; the game is garbage of the highest echelons.
6445	0	a	This Game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  Graphics are bad, gameplay is broken, donÂ´t waste your money on this game not even 0.99 dlls.
6446	0	a	This game is really buggy for me, I won't even pay $1 for it, LOL. Also when I played as a dinosaur it really sucked, I just kept dying. The game was confusing too, I didnt quite get it.
6447	0	a	Games garbage. I clicked to find a game, and it couldn't find any servers. I clicked play solo, it wouldn't stop waiting for other players...
6448	0	a	This would be really fun as a 90's arcade rail shooter. But it's not.
6449	0	a	From what I've played on the free weekend, I wouldn't buy this game, even for a dollar (I wonder if their Robocop reference was intentional). It may have been playable before this event, but now and probably later, given that it's $1 (and 1 whatever everywhere else, because devs can't work out exchange rates) the community will die. The controls as a dinosaur are nuts and really hard to master, because it's 3rd person and has very lengthy attack animations. As a human, the controls and gameplay are simple class and perk/upgrade based sci-fi FPS, with jetpacks and healing guns and cloaks and all that stuff. The guns are pretty fun but don't FEEL very varied in their own class, one pistol is like another ect. The powers are really fun to use, especially the jetpack, which got me out, and into, a lot of scrapes. The game itself is pretty hard, and it makes sense to be like that. If you're up against raptors or whatever, you'll easily take them alone, like it were a zombie game. But if you're faced with anything bigger, it's VERY hard to solo them, and (on the server I played on) dinos were crazily unbalanced, most were going for T-Rex with a few as pterosaurs to provide aerial support. For some reason, even when I'd jetpacked up a mountain to hide from the T-Rex jaws, the two ganging up on me could still attack me, despite a large gap between myself and their faces. The biggest issue here was the lack of teamwork. Like I said, most creatures are hard to take down above the size of a raptor. Here you NEED to work as a unit. This makes sense but the game itself isn't very conducive to teamwork, and what little support there is to rally your teammates goes ignored while they camp and fail the objective. Dinos don't have this limitation, though, because they can solo almost anything because they're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dinosaurs.  The human classes are cool, but the dino classes are dreadful, with little variation on the ground based dinosaurs, going only from small up to big.  All in all, this feels like Tribes, Halo, or some other sci-fi FPS, but then the devs threw in dinosaurs, because the dinos are really badly implemented.  If you want a dino game, I'd recommend the superior Primal Carnage (when it's on a sale, though, seeing as it's got a slow dev cycle and only has two game modes).
6450	0	a	NO NO NO This is one of the worst games i have played on pc. it lags so bad that it was under 30 fps on a hinght end pc. no dont buy it.
6451	0	a	The game doesnt even work, and when it does it seems to demand more specs that what the creator and steam page suggest, boring piece of garbage not worth even a dolar, unplayable even if it was always free
6452	0	a	cant belive that ppl are buying and playing this game
6453	0	a	Just,no. I played fo about 2 minutes to realise that this game has the worst animations in a game i have ever see(considering the technology avalable) aswell as there is not one thing in the game that hasn't been done in other games better such as the fight to survive(borderlands 1-2) just don't waste your money or time on this i got it for 99p and I'm dissapointed! I've reviewed some games that are bad, but not bad enough for me to give them a not-recommended rating but this has nothing positive to redeem its self.
6454	0	a	Tried the game. graphics are ok. mechanics are decent but overall was disappointing.
6455	0	a	Played this today with friends cause it looked interesting. I'd like to say it was fun, but this headache I now have wouldn't approve of it. The game gives the premise of having to fight dinosaurs with futuristic technology(mostly guns). I guess there are other things you can use too, but who's got time for that when you have 5 raptors magically spawning from your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? The A.I. controlled dinos vary in how intelligent they'll be, from packs of raptors lining up to be point farmed, to the exceptionally gifted artillery t-rex. Also, raptors cannot jump. Being a raptor, you should be able to climb a not very steep wall to get a camper, but no, eat some bullets. I think they're aware of how bad some dinos suck, because they threw in a flying one with a bomb on its back. Whoopedy doo. Now that I think about it, a t-rex probably put it on it, seeing as they're so precise. Sucky as they were though, playing a human was 10X worse. There's a confusing downing system where you shoot dinos to get back up like you're some vampire of dinosaurs. The best part about the down system is when you get eaten, and I'm not being sarcastic when I say that. Oh and, on top of everything, as a stegosaurus (the giant thing with spines on it's tail) you can't even smack things with your tail. Seriously?   I'm sure there will be people who've played this game since release and they will list all the things that are good about the game. But if you're considering paying money to play this, I'd suggest saving your couple bucks for something better.    tl;dr: Playing as a dino is the most fun you'll get out of this, and even then you'll wonder if the developers did anything more than look up the pictures of the dinosaurs they included.  
6456	0	a	I wish i had spent the 0.99â‚¬ on anything else. Really. This is not a good game. Do not buy it.
6457	0	a	Such a stupid game.THERE ARE NOT EVEN RECOIL,AND THOSE GUNS ARE JUST AS TERRIBLE AS IT COULD EVER BE.WTF is a M40 magnum?If you wanna make a ficitional game,then make it all fictional,WTH is actually in the devs' stupid mind?And those tanks,those vehicles just look fxxkin' stupid!And it feel ALL THE SAME when you drive it,the only difference between those vehicals is they have different appreance!The graphic and the special effects are also terrible,it look like tech from 2000!Don't ever buy this game!
6458	0	a	Steam sales can be dangerous. Bought it for 0.99 and still it isn't worth it.
6459	0	a	 Orion:Dino Beatdown  recieved alot of negative attention during its opening week; connection woes, crashes, hitboxes that didn't fit the models, lack of longevity and just overall janky-ness in gameplay and menus. Spiral Game Studios rebranded to  Orion:Dino Horde  some time ago.  Today(Feb 2014, some 10 months after the release) the connectivity and menu problems are still here just intermittent. if you have attempted or achieved to connect to one server already and return back to the menu, the refresh button does not seem to function. Connecting to a server is mostly an endless  Waiting for Server  nonsense -- even if the player count is at max. The game still waits rather than timing you out or proc'ing a  Server is Ful  error -- Killing the app and re-entering seems to be the only way to get more recent server data. Killing the app also resolves the issue of the endless waiting or the  Server is Full  error not proc'ing.  The preformance on the other hand, has been considerablely improved. The off-chance I connect to a server the frame rate starts high and stable, beyond wave 6 the framerate drops by progressive margines, though it is to be expected with so many entities at once on one screen. Not encountered one  Ran Out of Memory  scenario or crash.  The latency tolerance and the general operating of the game servers was improved, they are more consistent, shots hit and miss more reliably. No more shooting at a Dino on your client and on everyone else's you are shooting at scotch-mist or a little to the right of the Dino in front of you. Dinos, other players and yourself no longer warp around.  The longevity is the meaty issue.  Less than 30 game lobby/servers at what I consider peak times, namely after 7PM.   Not much content or game modes that feel distinct or fresh. Some of the game modes have been lifted whole-sale from L4D and because of the janky nature of Dino Horde they are less satisfying. The one that I enjoyed is Survival, which is your standard Horde-mode with a few twists. Rounds are finished by killing certain Dinos and every so often completing an objective, but they boiling down to  Go here for a bit  or  Interact with X object , when they are completed it snaps back to kill X amount of Dinos. Ending a wave is similar to Killing Floor, what with the money and shops.  Finally, the Janky-ness. Jank is inevitable in software, in games they sometimes add to the charm or even comic relief for a title. In Dino Horde, however, they exacerbate the poor/odd design decisions and delivers a raw, unpolished experience. One notable oddity is the interplay between class roles and map design: The Support has a medic tool, Recon has a stealth ability but the Assault has jumpjets. The Assault is easily by far  thee  go to role, just jet up out of reach of the Dinos or even perch on otherwise out of bounds terrain. No point in having a medic, noone gets hurt and no point in cloaking, noone needs to run away. In addition the AI and their pathing is a joke -- They will pursue one player through a crowd of players that aren't running away. They'll tottle off in weird directions or clip their heads though rocks trying to get to the players ontop instead of trying to kill players still on the ground -- These three things form a mind-numbingly, dull game, with little fair challenge. There have been situation where I was surronded by ~6 velociraptors and my health went from full to nothing in no time at all. Other situation where I was stood under a TRex with dozens of velociraptors being unable to take a slither of health off me. Generally players are happy perching on rocks to aviod these issues. So Orion:Dino Horde breeds complacency for one's own kill count from terrian out bounds to the Dinos.  Player movement is fairly slow, there is little of interest between the bases (so alot of dead space) and the maps are fairly large. These three things make sprinting from one side of the map to the other aggravatingly tedious -- Just a side note, there is also no sense of being hunted. There will either be a complete spawn-spam of Dinos in a small area which looks very gamey or not a Dino in site. When some Dinos do catch up to you, while sprinting, they form an orderly queue one by one. The one lead Dino will not leap or over take you, it will just tickle your back -- You will need to sprint those distances to get your Objective or secure a vehicle. There is a personal teleport to the spawn zone, but it goes unused as it  only  takes you to the spawn zone. Giving us a choice of pre-set locations to teleport to would be a better solution. Spawning a bike on my head or a hoverboard under my feet,  Unreal Tournament 3 style , could be other possiblities.  The vehicles drive weird. They're no GTA4 wonky driving physics but they're not as robust as something like Halo (which seems to be the  inspiration  for Orions vehicles). When you are on foot, you will sometimes clip through speeding vehicles that drive toward you, sometimes you'll be gently pushed aside and other times you'll go flying. The Vehicles are a necessary evil due to the fire power and lack of ammo considerations, I say 'evil' because the driving physics in gerenal are too inconsistent and minimalist. In addition they have papar armour and present at bigger target. Being in a vehicle can be more hazardous than its worth.   FINAL GRIEVANCES  +Multiplayer only with  a tiny population.  +No instructive information and counterintuitive - Nothing is explained, the rules and systems are learnt by trail and error. Using vehicles to ram the large Dinos, for eg. If we can damage and even kill the smaller Dinos logically we should be able to deal damage to the bigger ones, that is not the case however, they seem immune to collision damage and only serves to get the players inside killed instantly. Other eg's: How many peaks can we have at once, which weapons fit into which slot, many new players ask how to replenish ammo. It's quite suspect that one of the  hints  on a loading screen is 'If you see a new player, help them out', to me this says the Developers can't be bothered explaining their game.  +The guns have no substance - They generate little recoil. Reload and/or firing animations make the weapons seem lighter than air. Sound like you are firing baby pop-guns or banging a wooden spoon against a tin can.  +No sense of impact - The Dino's and Player's melee is just a tickle that ripes off health. The larger Dinos have a stomp ability which sends players flying but they animate like they are idly lowering their leg.  +Nothing visceral - Which in a Dinosaur franchise  should  be integral, the moments that we  should  remember is the time that the clever girl out foxed us and riped open our ribcage, not whipping their noses on our armour like they've come down with a fever. +And so, the final nail in the coffin for me. There is no theme of this Dinosaur game being a Dinosaur game. No gore and gruesome sites. No sense of scale from the large Dinos as their tonnage of biomass stomp around. No sense of fear or impending doom. No cunning or sneaky behaviour from the smaller carnivores. No natural enemy states, the TRex and Velociraptors should want to eat everything not just the marines in tin cans.   ORION: Dino Horde  is essentially a Sub-par First Person Shooter. Filled with brainless zombies in different shapes and  sizes. With no meaningful Co-op systems or mechanics. There is potential, not going to lie there were some fun moments   (because playing with friends)   to be had but the janky, unpolished nature would pull you out of them. Just needed the past 10 months to refine rather than stagnate. Not recommended!
6460	0	a	These Positive reviews have got me perplexed. This game is flawed in too many ways to have a good time. Truely, the animations are bad, the gameplay is sub-par. The only truely good this about this game is playing with friends is fun, and the graphics are nice and sleek, but truely not a game I recommend, it will get boring and really not worth a positive review.
6461	0	a	the server conection times take forever and the gameplay isnt all that, the weapon system kinda sucks as well
6462	0	a	This game is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ok.
6463	0	a	FOV locked under 90 degrees, the apparent 'Antialising' options do nothing to prevent the jagged lines nearly *everywhere*, lack of servers, and while attempting to join any open servers it was impossible (it wouldn't even bother to give me an error message unless it was a full server.  People say it's less buggy, and it doesn't seem buggy to be honest, but there are some extremely annoying 'features' of the game that make it hard to play- You're given 60 seconds between waves in one mode to get equipment and weapons for the next wave, but the equipment and weapons are placed over 30 seconds away so you have little or no time to choose what you want. The UI is fairly confusing and almost ugly in comparison with other titles that are *free to play*.  If it's full price, don't buy it. When it's $1/Â£1 then it's your choice. It's a good thing they made the game free to try out this week because I was tempted to buy it.
6464	0	a	Meh. that's how I felt playing this game for a while. Controls felt a little loose. oh-hum powerups and weapons. and seriously.. I need a whole clip of ammo to bring down ONE mob? So the balance isn't their either. Just a lack-luster game that's gonna try to nickle and dime you to death. 
6465	0	a	Game is very buggy while even just trying to get into a game cant connec to servers buttons not working nothing but buggy crap.
6466	0	a	This game sucks balls, and let me tell you why, 90% of the game is about sprinting to the reactor, sprinting to the implants station, sprinting to the armory. It's just running and running and running. Quite honestly, nothing like halo, where there was clear objectives, a cool Cortana Narrator, and a map that made sense.  The graphics are blurry, even at the highest settings, and the weapons take forever to reload. Not to mention, you can't sell weapons, it just unlocks a dozen of 'em that you can use. Maybe I was wrong? Right.. right? Nope. Still right, once you get vehicles they move incredibly slow, probably designed for granny newb players who've never played a racing game to save their life.  Is it worth $15? Is it worth $1? You decide.. they'd have to remake a ton of things to balance the game, and re-texture all the enemies, and add in more sound clips. Unlikely. If you want a good video game I suggest you drop this one, and go for Far Cry 3, much better in my honest opinion.
6467	0	a	Stupid and barley worth the $2.99 I paid for the 4 pack. Buggy, feels like a bad arcade game with the stupid voices, controls suck, in game purchases, nothing good really.
6468	0	a	This game is suppose to be much improved... Its terrible STILL!!!!! Not worth .99 cents. Couldn't get people to join my game they just sit in my lobby unable to do anything. The generator wouldn't even activate because the area to activate is buggy. Not sure who posted those positive reviews... Must be the devs or friends of the devs.
6469	0	a	To be honest.. this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6470	0	a	You wont like it if you're a dinophile (like me). You will like it, however, if you love sci-fy weapons, surviving in team against near infinite hordes of bad guys and shooting stuff while defending a generater that's about 300m away from the rest of the base.
6471	0	a	No, don't buy this game. Broken mechanics, Bad Graphics - This game is just crap.
6472	0	a	terrible game quality plays as if its stuck in an alpha dont even waste money on the sale price its just a bad game in general there are so many other good options go with the other ones this is a bad game the metascore did not lie. 
6473	0	a	
6474	0	a	I played it for free and still feel ripped off
6475	0	a	don't buy it
6476	0	a	It definitely wasn't at all what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be something like Natural Selection. And the BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE GAME IS THE FACT THAT MY SCREEN RESOLUTION ISN'T AN OPTION IN THE SETTINGS. I find it annoying since the game doesn't look as good as displayed in the videos. And right now, I don't believe it is even worth the $1 it is being offered for.
6477	0	a	Awful just awful not even worth $1.00
6478	0	a	This is an OK game
6479	0	a	Crashes, doesn't terminate on exit, fails to connect.. looks like a kindergartner pieced it together with construction paper and glue sticks.
6480	0	a	I was excited to play this game but once I started playing I was very disappointed. The game has a awesome concept but lacks in many ways.  1 . The que to play with other players takes along time. People often drop off and you are left sitting there for along time. I waiting for over 30 mins and still did not get to play with other players. 2. The control functions are not laid out very well. Very inefficent for combat.  3. The pictures that shows the games seems to be glossed over to make it look better than what it really is.   
6481	0	a	Its not that great of a game graphics suck and so does gameplay
6482	0	a	BAD BAD BAD BAD and don't buy it, EVER.
6483	0	a	Not fun at all. Too many bugs.
6484	0	a	If you like Halo 2 graphics, terrible menus, awful HUDs, and terrible animations then this game is for you.
6485	0	a	This game is a broken peice of garbage that isnt worth its 99 cent pricetag. DO NOT BUY
6486	0	a	Just boring, uninteresting, and not worth 1 dollar
6487	0	a	Better than COD Ghosts, still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tho
6488	0	a	I didn't play it for very long. That should tell you somthing.
6489	0	a	Gave it a try... Just too low quality for me. Reminds me PlanetSide 2 . But it worth the money if you love the genre.
6490	0	a	God, what a frustrating experience. The game has a terrible difficulty scale. You go from running over dinosaurs with no trouble at all in one round, and then you find yourself struggling to stay alive against a tricerotops and a T-rex on the other side of the map, meaning that the stuff you bought after slowly building up your funds over the course of several rounds is all gone. Once you manage to survive one of those rounds, you go back to mopping up little dinosaurs.  The weapons are not bad, but aiming down the sights is pretty much useless, as I've experienced. The AI is also pretty stupid, as the dinosaurs mindlessly run at you as soon as the game starts. This is the sort of thing I'd expect from a game that was released ten years ago. The game is obviously old fashioned; the graphics look like something from 2007 that got touched up a little with some motion blur.  Overall, there's very little to say about this game. It's very forgettable, and once you've played it for ten minutes, you've seen it all. Mann vs. Machine from Team Fortress 2 is better than this, and it's free. My friend bought this game for me, but I still couldn't imagine spending $1 on this game, let alone $15. If you have 99 cents burning a hole in your Steam funds, give this game a shot. But once the sale ends, do not even think about shelling $15 dollars on this game. It is simply not worth it.
6491	0	a	its a really cool game just online only and supper bugy if you run a movement script it will run for 2 seconts and then if u pause it will never stop running also no tutorials for this game :( if none of these bother u its an awsome co op game might be fixed later
6492	0	a	Its meh... definetelly better than the given meta score, but not by much. It is really repetitive but would be fun with friends. Like most games, i would recommend buying when it is cheap since it probably is not worth more than 5 dollars.
6493	0	a	Playing this game is like sticking your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in a blender.
6494	0	a	wow, absolutley terrible framerate, even with all settings set to low. I want my money back.
6495	0	a	I tried this game just to see how bad it was... and i have to say, it would have had some great potential if the develpers worked more on it before releasing it ( -feels *very* Unfinished/Rushed).. plus the servers are awful and the lag sucks big time.. but in my opinion, most of the rumors are true: this game is rather awful in its current state. hopefully one day there will be enough patches added to it to make it somewhat playable. (wouldn't doubt if it went F2P soon)
6496	0	a	This game can crash, it didn't work on my laptop, but it works on my desktop. It's pretty temperamental. It's not a really good game. It's a grindfest for achievements, there's no dino AI to make it more exciting or forcing you to change your tactics. It's pretty mindnumbing but at least it's better than X-Blades (yeah, don't bother with that crap). The graphics aren't good. It could have been better. It leaves a lot for improvements.
6497	0	a	This game is horrible in every aspect. The gameplay, sounds, graphics. The game its not fun in anyway. Game lags like hell, you can't even play properly its like you're playing with 500ms ping with your character rubberbanding. Very weak sound effects. You don't even see the muzzle flash coming from the weapon to the point that you ask yourself 'Is it firing?'.  
6498	0	a	the game is lacking some key aspects that being..... graphics from the last 6 bagillion years and game mechanics from the past 10
6499	0	a	Damn, if this is the new and improved version of the game I'd hate to have seen how bad it was origially. A mess. don't bother
6500	0	a	I'd rather play Brink than this game ever again.
6501	0	a	Like Skyrim with guns! or Halo, with dinosaurs! and lo-res textures...
6502	0	a	As of 23/04/2014, ORION: Dino Horde was in offer in Steam for 0.99$. Still. Don't. Worth it.  I had my doubts because a lot of people is saying ''After the update it got better!'' and ''Metacritic changed the 3 score to 8!''. If they did I think it should have stayed in 3. The game is full of bugs. Characters getting stuck, problems at shooting (With the important fact that when you shoot there are no signs of knowing if any single bullet hit your target OR anything at all. No lights, no bullets, you just hear you are shooting and see your gun move as a dying chicken). Chat user interface is in primitive state.  You may want to risk in buying it for ''further cool updates''. But sadly, it just don't look like it's going to evolve. If this game is worth 15$ And you are planning on buying it on 0.99$ anyway. I ask you to take your time and download the demo so you can see it with your own eyes. Otherwise take a look on a gameplay review.  It look's like a win deal. It's not. This game is not even half-way and it doesn't seem It's going anywhere.  
6503	0	a	Let me handle this. This game is just... the worst. The metacritic score of 30 is even too generous. I was tricked by the other people writing positive reviews about this game. I picked it up when it was just $0.99 and I still feel ripped off.
6504	0	a	Don't buy this; can't connect to games and even if you can, gameplay is terrible.
6505	0	a	Tried if from free week... Animations are very bad, and sometimes the dinosaurs (the other team) cannot hit you when you are below them.  Does not feel polished at all.
6506	0	a	Horrible. Terrible graphics. Annoying gameplay (sprinting for 30 seconds just to go get an upgrade between waves, only to have no time to look at the upgrades and make a comparison). And when I tried to exit the game it stuck running in steam. So badly that even after ending the Steam process (the only way i could close steam at that point) and restarting it, the game is still stuck running.   Not worth $.99, or even $.009.
6507	0	a	The worst thing I have ever played! Take Killing Floor, then put it into a really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Halo setting and mix in some dinosaurs. After one hour in a basement with a 1987 Apple Macintosh, you get ORION: Dino Horde
6508	0	a	This game is trash, sorry im sure this game has improved alot compared to what it used ot be. The fact there is no tutorial and you have to learn as you go is bad for new players. or how about how unresponsive the dinos are i played alot of this during the free weekend. the humans just dominate the dinos i feel this game has alot of potential but its not using it i do not recomend at this time
6509	0	a	Wow this game is total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥e! I wasted $3 on the 4 pack. No one would ever play this game with me and if they were sad enough to do it I think i'd have to unfriend them.
6510	0	a	I have to admit it this game is among the worst game ever DONT BUY THIS GAME there are almost no server in multiplayer when you try to join a server it will say 'failed to connect' and this game physic is terrible
6511	0	a	With graphics that seem to be decades out of date, the gameplay is choppy and boring. It was impossible for me to join a server, I went to the website and could not even make an account. I think 0.99 for this game is about 100 times what it is worth. Will not play again, would of been a great game 15 years ago, but times have changed and this has not.
6512	0	a	I like the idea, I mean who doesn't want more games with dinosaursin them, but the programming is just horrible. Haven't tried lan yet but online it has awful netcode issues so it feels like you're playing with a medium or high ping, no matter what hardware or connection you have, and the dinosaurs move very static.
6513	0	a	I know i played the game for a short amount of time but god the game is terrible and a reasone i played it not that much because it kept crashing alot over 25 times to me dont buy it i thought it would be a nice dino game :/
6514	0	a	Got this for $1 on steam and felt it was an absolute steal. After playing a good days worth with some friends, I couldn't help but feel that there is so much more missing... I absolutely enjoyed having a trex rock up and try tip my vehicle over (reached to my JP nostalgia) and then having to deal with a trex and a spinosaur, it had me convinced that it was definitely worth the buy. I couldn't recommend this game to a friend for anything more than $5-$7 dollars as it still feels like the game was only partially fleshed out. In saying that, the concept is great, the combat has a nice flow, the first few fights with large dinosaurs are exciting, however it becomes very limited in the dinosaur diversity after a while.   Although I've read into the criticisms against ORION, I believe that my enjoyability in the game isn't based of the designers themselves but instead based off the product that they push out. I hope the developers take a positive approach to the gaming communities reaction and produce a game that I could safely recommend to fellow gamers and know they would enjoy it as much as I have.
6515	0	a	Don't buy this game.  Gameplay is bad. Graphics is good, if you can max it, but the game is so badly optimized. The metascore does not lie.
6516	0	a	This game would get a better review from me If the gameplay wasn't so incredibly bad. Everything from the weapons having 3 sound effects from each class, either sped up or slowed down. to the AI that has zero tact at all. Controls are hiddeous. The list goes on and on. Don't trust the screenshots, this has been super doctored, looks like garbage even for 2012 standards. Fantastic concept, terrible execution. I give it a reluctant 4/10 waste of HD space.
6517	0	a	While it has Dinosaurs that doesn't save it from being a bad game.
6518	0	a	I don't know what else I expected for $1
6519	0	a	
6520	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6521	0	a	Pros:  -Nice looking atmosphere  -Easy to pick up  -You get to play as a dinosaur!  Cons:  -Boring and repetetive combat  -If you've seen one dinosaur, you've seen them all. They act they same just different sizes  -Glitches a plenty  -Weapons feel weak   -Game is way to easy to pick up, if you can aim you can win  -T Rex flipping a superheavy tank over a mountain with it's nose  -Vehicles are useless once the enemies get too close  -Dinosaurs in the snow would freeze to death; they should have added something different  -Several versions of the same weapons are not cool just lacking in creativity  -Devs know nothing about dinosaurs  My rating would have to be 4 / 10
6522	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest game to ever be on steam
6523	0	a	Despite the generous sale, that brought the game down to 99 cents for quite a while, this game isn't even worth that.  The horrendous gunplay is the one thing that will really put you off. Shooting anything is just not fun, especially when this weird effect makes the models look like 2D sprites upclose. Throw in the fact that the kick is either non-existant, poorly animated, or out of control and unrealistic, and you're not going to have much fun. This game is about shooting dinosaurs, and shooting dinosaurs in this game isn't something that you can do for a while before wanting to play something else with solid gunplay, like Insurgency.  The guns just feel so weird, nothing makes them feel powerful or fun to use. If you want a wave-based survival game, play Killing Floor, it is a lot better, just without dinosaurs.
6524	0	a	not as cool as it looks
6525	0	a	It's as bad as you've heard it is. Hilariously, poorly optimized graphics, clunky controls; the AI is spectacular, though, and do a great job of single-mindedly hunting you down like the dog you are. Definitely a team game, but good luck finding someone who'll play it with you.
6526	0	a	Rather boring game, doesnt worth the price
6527	0	a	2/5 stars, and I'm being generous with that score just because it has dinosaurs in it....   Not a great game, I had high hopes for this one, but it was frankly a dissapointment, $15 was way to much, wish I'd gotten on that $1 sale.  Human gameplay is meh, nothing much really to say about it, controls feel weird to me, they feel like COD. The dinosaur gameplay in my opinion leaves much to be desired. When playing as a dinosaur you may aswell just use either trex, triceratops, or deinosuchus, any other class just dies in a couple hits or is a remodel of one of the above just with less abilities. Playing as a dinosaur in Orion Dino Horde it isn't fun, if what your looking for is playing as a dinosaur than I wouldn't recommend this game for you, something more along the lines of Primal Carnage or DinoDDay is more dinosaur gameplay oriented.   All in all its a reasonably funny game, especially running over dinosaurs (and occasionally teammates) with vehicles, but that being said this game is really only good for a laugh or two with friends. If you don't find going into a broken game with friends and goofing around for lols fun, than go buy Primal Carnage or DinoDDay for a dinosaur FPS/TPS.
6528	0	a	It isnt the best dino survival game online is not very good , online servers are laggy as hell so sadly no i do not recommend this game :P
6529	0	a	I had such high hopes for Orion since I first saw it back on the Source engine.  Since then, it has changed to UE3 (to my dismay) and has gone through a perpetual cycle of lies, deceit, and failed promises.  Some of those broken promises have been delivered upon, but myself and many others feel it is too little too late.  The game still suffers many flaws and just simply isn't what it was initially teased to be.  Can it be fun? Sure, get it on sale and it is worth a few dollars.  Will I buy from Spiral again? That is something that only time will tell.
6530	0	a	There are bad games.....Then there is Dino Horde......Whole new level....
6531	0	a	only one reason i bought is the price was only 0.99 or 1.99. i don't suggest ou but it for the original price, cause it's kind of boring and not good for the picture. I feel disappointed for the models of the dinosaur.
6532	0	a	just the worsts
6533	0	a	Terrible game , dont be tricked into buying this.
6534	0	a	No.  When you rip animations from Halo 1, you know there is going to be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ problem. It's pathetic, lazy, and downright ugly just to look at.  0/10.
6535	0	a	The only reason for me to play it is collecting the rest of trading cards ...ã€Don't buy this game!ã€‘
6536	0	a	I am probably going to get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on for this review but i feel like this is needed  This game is just bad.
6537	0	a	Who would pay 14.99 for a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ game such as this???!?!?!?!
6538	0	a	there is 10 mins that I can never get back.... such bad game.. wow.....much hate....
6539	0	a	this game is a finaky 1 thats for shur this review is 2 parts 1 i like the game and the mechanics it employs its fun for what it is like a dinosour killing floor but with how meny bugs there are and the fact that it crashs a lot no i would not recamend it at this time if the dev can see this i would recamend he try to fix this game asap its more buggy a game then some of the pre alpha test games i play this is a good game its just to buggy to be thoroly enjoyable at this time unless forse closeing games and restarting them is fun to u .
6540	0	a	You know, I'm not surprised it went on sale for one dollar, it is that bad.
6541	0	a	Just so bad... thats probably why it was $1 for so long
6542	0	a	Do NOT buy this game!   The gunplay is horrible the dinosaur A.I is messed up and even though i have a fairly strong computer, it still lagged whenever I did anything  In short that Metacritic review is spot on, and this is utter tripe.
6543	0	a	Never again
6544	0	a	Great game for $0.99 not for 14 bucks... 
6545	0	a	:/ not worth for 15$ unless you fix this f*cking crash from the start! i don't recommend this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
6546	0	a	The main idea is great, I mean you could pick a T Rex or a Pterodactyle and attack humans. That's fun. But, despite nice graphics for the end of previous century this game have an horrible gameplay. It's really a pain in the *** to fight in it, even with human faction. Weapon are not good neather. The maps configuration and possibilities are not good, but not that bad. I'm used to CS, maybe that's why i don't liked this one, but honnestly if you like good FPS, GO FAR AWAY!  I know this is a small or a independant game, bla bla bla but it's a shame to waste such a original idea whith that gameplay. Devloppers should work harder next time.
6547	0	a	Its like having a high ping the entire time... Dinosaurs are not fun to fight like you would think..... THIS GAME IS TRASH...... I wont play it even for free......
6548	0	a	Purchased it during the $1 promotion. I can't say much bad about it for being a dollar at the time. I wouldn't really pay $15 for the game, though.
6549	0	a	Its pretty bad. I couldnt figure out how to buy ammo, and it constantly goes into slow motion. But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was 99 cents.
6550	0	a	don't buy this game its gawd horrible, waiting over a year or longer to play the dinos look like they are projections graphics are horrible.
6551	0	a	ugh. i bought this as a low cost shooter, with no expectations beyond the 'single-player' feature listed on the Steam page.   It might be single player if you like wandering around a multiplayer map alone shooting the same six dinos over and over. With dated graphics, poor sound, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AI, and no single player campaign nor players to play against....   3 thumbs down - stay away
6552	0	a	This game has so many bugs it's not even funny.
6553	0	a	LOLOLOL I bought this game for less than a dollar and it's still not worth it. Terrible voice acting. Terrible dinosaur mechanics. There's random dinosaurs that are extremly overpowerd that just ruins the fun. I'd have to write a lot more to explain how much this game sucks. Worst game I've ever played.
6554	0	a	I spent 99 cents on this game and I still feel ripped off.  And before anyone says 'you haven't spent enough hours in this game to give it a negative review' please realise that when a game feels this broken and crappy logging any real time into it is a serious chore. It's easy to spend tons of hours in a great game, but if a game can't even keep my interest for more than 15 mins then I consider that a flaw with the game, not with my attention span.  My first complaint is the controls are complete garbage. I'm playing with an Xbox 360 controller. There is VERY NOTICABLE latency on any button that I hit, no matter which server I join. This alone completely destroys the experience and qualifies the game for a negative review by it's self.  Also, when I move the left stick my character continues moving well after I release the stick. Moving around in this laggy game feels like slipping around on ice.   There is very little to no explanation as to the game objectives, and when I join a server other players of course don't want to coach a noob and will kick me out of their servers for even asking how to play. And of course there are no turorials that I could find to help me acclimate to this game.  The end result is a game that feels barely functional, lags horribly, controls horribly, and a confusing play style that puts new players at a severe handicap.  Ohh but on the plus side, THERE ARE DINOSAURS!!!! Derpa derp!
6555	0	a	Stops working after starting a solo game.   When I first got this game, it worked after tweaking with the graphics settings. I would have reccomended it. Now it doesn't start up a solo game.   Do I get a refund?
6556	0	a	Its fake halo... with dinosaurs.  yeahh...
6557	0	a	I have played this game for a bit now and here is my impression: While the core gameplay is fun and didn't get boring yet, there are a ton of problems with this game: - It isn't very polished; for example the menu has no animations at all and feels very clunky - Not many people playing - there are little servers you can join and you are lucky if you find one that isn't survival. You also have to be careful with the ping as someone from australia can play with someone from germany I believe. That brings me to my next point: - No offical servers. Every server is hosted by someone else playing the game. If that persons decides that he doesn't want to play anymore after half an hour, you too have to stop and join another server while loosing all the progress you made on the last one - Classes are kind of pointless. The best class is the jetpack one because you can get up onto rocks and snipe dinos while you cant get hit. Recon is fun but pointless as you loose your invisibilty when attacking unless you use (weak) silenced weapons. The medic just stands on the ground and can heal others which is boring - Dying wants to make you quit. If you die in this game and there isn't an ally around or, which is the case of the time, the allies just don't revive you, you are stuck waiting in a spectator mode until the next objective is complete. That means waiting for up to five minutes sometimes which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horrible. - There is an in-game shop where you can customize your character for real money. That alone not being horrible enough, the stuff there makes your already horrendously looking character look even worse but at least give no better stats. But an in-game shop for a game you already bought? Not my taste.  But if you are alive, amassed some credits and found a good lagless server with a person who isn't planning on leaving it is a fun game if you have nothing else to do. Was worth the buck for me as I got it on sale, but I wouldn't recommend to buy it for the full price.
6558	0	a	Dino what? I've played about five games online now and haven't seen a single dino. In fact I haven't seen much at all except about 30 seconds of gameplay before someone with a better gun and a thousand hours blows you away from behind. Didn't realize it was a frag fest, and as such it doesn't compare to Unreal Tournament 15 years ago. Disappointed.
6559	0	a	Do not waste your money on this game.
6560	0	a	kind of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. not worth the time
6561	0	a	I was excited at first - who wouldn't be? Shooting dinosaurs in the face, jetpacks, bigass swords, etc... it sounded too good to be true. Unfortunately, it is so buggy, so unfinished, that it leaves the player frustrated and annoyed.
6562	0	a	Graphics: average 5/10 The dino are ulgy but the landscape is acceptable Audio:Poor 3/10 Music does not fit the game The shooting sound is not realistic and the narrator is so annoying  Gameplay:average 5/10 Find it boring after a few rounds as dino only go stright to you and they dont have lots of different skills Sometimes I think that it is just like left 4 dead with zombies replaced by dino. (left 4 dead is better :D )  Maybe it would be interesting when it comes to multiplayer  but consider it is only 1 dollar on sale. It is acceptable Overall: 4/10
6563	0	a	Good game but doesnt even let me finish a match bfore it crashes.....
6564	0	a	There isn't really much to do, you just shoot dinosaurs, rinse and repeat. It becomes boring after a few rounds.
6565	0	a	Trash. Not worth a single penny. Would not play it if it were a free half life one mod.
6566	0	a	this game is bad lol
6567	0	a	Only 11 servers, one of which had a ping of under 100ms. Tried to connect; connection was reset or timed out and the game crashed. Hate writing bad reviews because I know how much blood, sweat and tears must go into making a game like this, but come on guys...
6568	0	a	This game just sucks, to be honest.
6569	0	a	This game is a huge waste of time and money. every mission is the same. nothing never changes and it very buggy and oftenly found my self regretting even buying this game even though it only cost me Â£0.99.
6570	0	a	i bought this as a gift and couldnt send it till my friends trial was over. after remembering i had it i no longer have it in my inventory. steam owes me a new game or a refund ASAP!!! Double thumbs down and a middle finger
6571	0	a	Worst game I have played in the last 10 years... Horrible controlls, movement is clunky as hell, the combat is half â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. This game is so bad, that I regret that I wasted a DOLLAR on it.
6572	0	a	I don't know why all this fuss is here about, the game, but i do know the game is alot of fun. Patches really help this title and hopefully the game can comeback with a sequal to show people this isn't a terrible series. I don't recommend buying the game at full price, but when it is on sale, pick it up for a good time and laugh with friends.
6573	0	a	Extremely repetitious without the feeling of advancment. Needs more diverse gameplay mechanics. Feels beta. Worth the dollar i paid for it.
6574	0	a	This game is bad, unbalanced, tiresome and the engine is awful. I didn't buy it and neither should you.
6575	0	a	Did u forget about to fix some bugs?
6576	0	a	I payed full price for Aliens: Colonial Marines and felt I got my moneys worth. I sometimes buy a lottery ticket and even if I don't win I think it's money well spent.   This game wasn't worth the dollar I payed for it.
6577	0	a	Good Game but not Computer Shop Friendly.... unlike Dota 2
6578	0	a	this game is utter crap. sure it was fun the one time it worked, but thegraphics, controls, and sounds were horrible. i would play it again but for whatever reason it wont download the update. my final score: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. and by the way, ignore the amount of hours of allegedly put into the game, that was just some sort of glitch or bug that steam has right now.
6579	0	a	If this game added better animation for dinosaurs and smoother gameplay I would recommend it. More game modes than you could want and plenty of massive maps, worth trying on a free weekend or getting on a sale
6580	0	a	This is not that good of a game not well made do not play it
6581	0	a	just no, couldnt find anything i liked about this game at all
6582	0	a	Pretty fun to play with friends. I can't say Im going to play this a lot by myself however. The developers were obviously influenced by games like Halo, Killing Floor, and Team Fortress 2, and those elements make this game even better.
6583	0	a	Terrible animations, dumb ai, terrible performance, and flying tanks. These are some of the very few problems with this 'game'. I put game in quations because a game is a form of interactive media, and more than 7/8 the time the only form of interacting you do with this 'game' is quiting it. This 'game' isn't worth the 89 cents I paid for it.
6584	0	a	This game. It's not even worth the buck I bought it for. If you consider buying it, don't. You might think: it's halo with dinosaurs, how could it be bad? Well, it is. Halo is a nice game, and it looks like they copied it, but left the good things out (why would you need fun in a video game). It's all the bad things of Halo combined WITH badly designed dinosaurs. There's one or two gamemodes where you can play as a dinosaur, but it makes no sense and the dinosaurs only have one (maybe two) attacks. The weapons make no sense either and the game sounds like a goat being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by a T-Rex that just chopped of its leg.
6585	0	a	If I could get into a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game I could review this peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6586	0	a	complete and Utter Garbage game No new user guides no clues on what going on , not to mention the dino animations are complete trash ... Avoid this like a Zombie apocalypse
6587	0	a	This is one of the worst games i have ever played.I bought it when it was on sale , at 1 â‚¬ ,i regret it so much..
6588	0	a	great game to play with friends but by yourself it is quite boring
6589	0	a	pretty boring, not balanced. the maps are big. accuracy is not very good. the concept is awesome just not polished.
6590	0	a	Had problems finding a server, only 9 servers ever showed up and most of them were empty.
6591	0	a	Don't even buy it
6592	0	a	This game is terrible. The A.I is poorly programed, the hit detection can be buggy, the whole world in this game is glitchy. Do yourself a favor and NEVER PLAY THIS GAME
6593	0	a	Don't buy this game or at the very least don't buy it full price. The waves become repetitive, the enemies are uninteligent, and there is something wrong with the mouse sensitivity.
6594	0	a	Halo + Jurassic Park. But there's a catch: it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6595	0	a	Virtually unplayable. The concept is really cool, and it looks fun, but they drop you in the game with a pistol that barely does anything against the dinos. You are required to buy time-consuming upgrades while the dinosaurs come at you. Then you're dead. Fortunately they give you one of those 'kill to survive' tropes, but as you rapidly shoot at the dinos, they quickly run away before your weak gun can kill one.  3/10  Three points for dinosaurs.
6596	0	a	well so far is good but less player
6597	0	a	This game may be fun for some, but for me... it was pretty lacking. The concept of an open world dinosaur hunting game, with vehicles and great visuals and adventures and fun times is a great idea in itself, but this game didnt really offer much fun to me. I also experienced a decent bit of performance issues on my rig. I dont have a crazy gaming computer, but I have something decent, and I can play some pretty decently resource-heavy games (Borderlands, GTA IV, Just Cause 2, BF3, etc). But I had issues with this game. Overall, I'd give it a 3.5/10 ... which sucks, because I like the idea.
6598	0	a	I don't dislike anyone enough on my friends list to give a gift copy of this game to.
6599	0	a	Waste of time 
6600	0	a	When I look up in to the night sky, I ponder - as i yearn for a majestic experience regarding raging dinosaurs. The answer my friend is Orion: Dine Horde. This game is the most fantastic, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ic relevation that I have ever experienced.   11/10 because why not.
6601	0	a	I tried to think of a first person shooter worse than this, but I can't at the time of writing this review.
6602	0	a	This game... What can I say? This game is glitchy as hell and has absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t moments. Now you may be saying. 'What game doesn't have it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t moments?'. And while this is true this game pushes it to an extreme... I would say this is basically killing floor with dinosaurs but that would be disgracing killing floor. It's more like it tried to be like that but failed, there are vehicles, gun stations, and ammo stations which all and all is cool. But not every base in the damn maps have these which is utter stupidity. Anyway off of that you have an AMAZING 3 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ CLASSES all of which seem utterly useless to anyone besides yourself. And what an amazing variety of guns about what like 12 tops. WOOOO! I'm so pumped... (Completely sarcastic). So is this game worth the money no. Should you buy it if friends did, maybe. But only for the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'n'giggles it gives you when your not raging because you wasted your money on a vehicle that dies too fast. I digress make your decision.
6603	0	a	I wish I could un-purchase this 4-pack. It really sounded fun on paper to me, and I didn't see any issues in the video, but it really turned out to not be any fun at all. It just feels janky and old.  DO NOT PURCHASE
6604	0	a	Eh, its okay. not the best. Primal carnage is ALOT better, though.
6605	0	a	I would like to preface this review by saying that I was honestly fairly excited for this game. Not because I was disillusioned by some gimmicky gameplay grandeur, but because it has dinosaurs in it. Dinos are the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and they're my favorite monster/animal. It's a shame that ORION couldn't live up to anything particularly special, or, good for that matter.  The Co-op is finnicky, the horde mode is too easy, the gun balance is terrible, the graphics are horribly optimized, and the textures are of a low resolution. If you can slog through most of the game on the surface it looks awful, but after playing with it for a bit, you can clearly see some decent (even good) ideas thrown in.   The vehicle options are cool, some of the guns are awesome, and playing as some of the dinos is fun. It just doesn't feel thought out and the execution is exceptionally poor. Some of the dinos are glitchy, and don't play or attack correctly. Some vehicles are nothing more than road kill simulators, and the weapon imbalance stated earlier gives me zero incentive to try-out or use any of the other more interesting guns. All-in-all, ORION: Dino Horde was a poorly developed game with some cool ideas just feel dropped half-way through. It's unfortunate for us dino-lovers. Perhaps we'll get a good dino game one day, but it's not today.
6606	0	a	 ORION: Dino Horde certainly delivers hordes and hordes of dinosaurs.   Pros: Dinosaurs, Music, Multiplayer Cons: Repetitive, Balance, Community   ORION: Dino Horde entertains for a while with its virtually endless number of dinosaurs. The soundtrack to the slaughter fits well, though the sound effects and narrator less so. Multiplayer, especially with friends, adds much to the fun.  However, the gameplay itself is boringly repetitive after the first hour or so. Dinosaurs' simple AI will only ever rush players and every vehicle seems to have the same turret.   The game is balanced poorly in many different respects: long respawn times in Survival and Conquest modes, infinite instant respawns of powerful player-controlled dinosaurs in Rampage mode, and other issues.   The number of online players reaches about fifty on weekends at most, so most other gamemodes are never played. Grinding achievements will require a buddy and quite a bit of time for completionists.  ORION: Dino Horde offers a little enjoyment slaughtering waves of mindless reptiles.  5/10
6607	0	a	It's not bad for it's price, but it's simply too boring to get into. You get a gun and shoot dinosaurs, that's it. Not enough gameplay for my taste, but it can definetely apeal to a lot of other people.
6608	0	a	I played this game for about 35 minutes. The controls felt pretty poor, the voice acting is subpar, and the graphics leave a bit to be desired. There's not much about it that makes me want to go back.
6609	0	a	Waste of money and time.
6610	0	a	I cannot play this game due to major lag. I am pretty sure that its not my fault that I cannot play it as my friends have the same problem. I spent many time on it trying to understand what the problem was but I didnt manage to change anything. Bought it for nothing...
6611	0	a	A waste of $$$  So many glitches in this game. Don't waste a cent on it people.
6612	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ :)
6613	0	a	Mediocre at best. 5/10
6614	0	a	I picked this up in the steam summer sale, it was VERY cheap and i thought what the hell. I have to say it can be quite enjoyable, it was a laugh to run around and shoot dinosaurs, but you wont feel too engrossed in it.  I dont recommend this game for any considerable price, but pick it up if its super cheap again, and give it a go, it can be quite amusing, even for only a short while :)
6615	0	a	Possibly the worst online game you can buy on steam. The textures are from a ms-dos games; the annimations of the dinosaurs are laughable and the vehicles are complete rip offs from halo.   If you can get a 4-pack in a steam sale for Â£1 each then do it as it will provide many laughs due to how trench tier this game is.
6616	0	a	This game is close to a good game as a t-rex is close to rubbing its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with it's hands. Dont buy this underdevopled modern piece of dino turd!
6617	0	a	Not worth it.
6618	0	a	Orion: Dino Horde is not worth your money.  While the game makes it out that jetpacks and dinosaurs are a good idea (and they are), the game poorly executes this. Games generally are you and a bunch of your friends shooting at 3 t rexes. Your weapons are practically worthless, the trex has boat loads of health, and the trex can throw rocks at you. The problems get worse. DInosaur animations look horrible to the point that they look like horrible mods. Areas look sparse and lifeless until one of these poorly walking dinos appear, at which point the game ends up looking like a mod. There are better games like this one, like Dino Dday. Orion is not worth you time and money.
6619	0	a	This is a beta-quality title. I bought the 4-pack for $2.99 and I still regret it; at $14.99 I would consider this a scam!
6620	0	a	is this some kind of teenager joke?
6621	0	a	Isn't even worth it with 90% discount, got it for 1 euro and now I regret it. Empty servers, cardboard dinos, ridiculously low FOV. Wouldn't recommend.
6622	0	a	Bad game, just bad.  Well it was 90c.
6623	0	a	Worst game, by far, I've ever played...
6624	0	a	Can heal your own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with the support class medic gun.  11/10
6625	0	a	always low memory in my Rig   hufffff
6626	0	a	Im actually loving this game, its fun to watch and play. Only two things i have issues with, the revolver acts strange when you try to fire it quickly, and lag in servers, i need to aim,shoot,bash, way ahead of the dino's in some situations. Overall I would recomend this game to my friends. _____________________ EDIT LINE _______________ pros- guns, dinos, cars... explosions, etc  cons- pay for the game... just to find out that there are ingame credits that can buy cool hats and colors  I just paid money for this game... do i really have to pay more for colors and skins?  ^ you can not earn these special credits. Greedy dev's Hid the fact that 'misc' are unearnable.  Im still going to play this, just not happily.
6627	0	a	This game... not much is to be said about it. Ill just say that you shouldnt buy the game, it doesnt work. It has the potential to be a pretty good game, but you cant play it because half the time it wont let you join a server. and right now i bet your saying'but it has single player also!' indeed it does, but this component of the game doesnt work either.  
6628	0	a	Do not buy this game this game sucks it lags alot and its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6629	0	a	Heehee thanx for the game crabcake ... but it's horrible ;D
6630	0	a	hmmm how to start this review ........ oh screw it this game is a boring and lame steaming pile of horse crap and whether it is on sale or not huge waste of time, and money. garbage garbage garbage
6631	0	a	Don't buy this game if you like your money. Don't pay $15 for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6632	0	a	Worst game I have ever played.
6633	0	a	This game feels very awkard and somewhat undone. The character I chose kept repeating the same voice lines randomly, and the dinosaurs are ugly. The balance between dinosaurs is very, very weird. For example, The medium generic dinosaur takes 5 shots to kill, the tiny one takes 2, and the big one takes over 30. Customization is extremely limited and was way too small to capture my intrest, and this game will probably ask you for $ in exchange for cosmetics that are just reskins. The cars are straight from Halo, as in their turning, brakes, mounted turret, are exactly like Halo. In fact, the more I think about it, alot of the player's character feels like Master chief from Halo, in terms of their mechanics. The in-game maps look ugly too.  4/10: It has a very indie feel, and not in the unique charming sense, more like in the 'I didn't finish the game and I have ran out of ideas, buy DLC' feel. If it intrests you, get it on sale or as a gift. Other than that, don't purchase it.
6634	0	a	Killing Floor, with dinosaurs and bad animations.
6635	0	a	The Antichrist's parents would probably be as defensive of their offspring's faults.....  I'm going to make a list of the people who gave this a positive review, just so that I know who not to trust in future.... Someone actually gave it a 10/10.... I'm gobsmacked  Perhaps the multiplayer is good, but the single player mode is a complete waste of time.   In this case I agree with the Metacritic score
6636	0	a	Compys take 4 headshots to kill on easy mode 2/10 would not play again  Only an hour into this game, I've found that I can't heal up my character unless I get downed and kill something in Last Stand or whatever it's called, Shields seem to only restore when you have most of or full health, and as far as I'm aware, you need a Support to heal yourself period. In other words, Solo mode is garbage and the button should be removed altogether. What worried me the most on solo mode is finding out about the larger dinos for the first time, and watching the amount of smaller ones steadily increase the longer it took me to find the larger one. The ammo on my primary is virtually gone, and if I'm guessing correctly, you have to run back to base to grab more. It's a large map, and if your vehicle blows up, good luck running back being chased by flying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, hoping one of them doesn't grab you and drop you from high enough to kill you with fall damage.  This is very clearly a game meant for you to play with friends or other people, and only that. And, quite frankly with my horrible router, that's not going to happen anytime soon.
6637	0	a	this game has too many errors 1.when i join a online server the game will freeze 2.when i run the game, she will take a lot of time to open
6638	0	a	Rewrite  This game has just barely improved since Dino Horde. The character models have been redone and that's about it. It's still the same terrible game. Easily worth the $1.00 I spent on it, but that doesn't mean it's actually any good.
6639	0	a	Worst game I've ever played.  EDIT: That was until I played Dizzel, now this is the second worst game I've played.
6640	0	a	Dont buy this game its a total fraud. Its buggy , barely playable, repetive and worse than an alpha version of basically any other game! The Meta Userscore is 2,7 out of 10! And 10 out of the 11 positive reviews where made from accounts that all where created between may 4th and may 8th, and never rated any other game, so one doesnt need to be a smartass to see what has happened here... Avoid that game like the plague!
6641	0	a	Boring and confusing generic shooter with only the 'hook' of dinos to shoot.
6642	0	a	This game is a joke. Wouldnt buy it even for 1cent (A friend gave it to me)
6643	0	a	Awful. It looks like Halo 1 on low settings.
6644	0	a	Eh, It's OK
6645	0	a	I can't connect to my friend's server. Game is awesome but connection sucks
6646	0	a	in the advert this game looks brilliant in every way but as soon as you get it you soon realise that its not the best game ever like said in the add but the worst game i have played in my entire life i definatley do NOT!!!!! recomend this game.
6647	0	a	dude i payed for it when i came out and i didnt like it it was not like dayz or battlefield just not the type of thing i like it doesnt have ZAMBIES 
6648	0	a	Sadly another no so polished may have had some good ideahs but strickly multiplayer without a point. Yes games don't need them. You can hack and slash, tank and spack, and shoot your foes too a bloody mess with no more point then meh I'm bored. Seriously though this is just graasping at straws for ssomething new when there's so much out there as cheap as this and better. But, if your grasping for the something new and got nothing better to do then try this then fine. I found the world to be rushed to be made. Effectss that others made and came standard, WHICH YOU CAN ALWAYS NOTE THE DIFFERENCE DUE TO HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE COMPAIRED TO THE WORLD AROUND YOU. Sadly it lacks me caring about the objectives and just being lead around in a world that leaves me questioning why bother. Killing dinosoars sure, but then can't I just do that in turok???
6649	0	a	I can't even call this monstrosity a game, so just don't even think of buying it. The fact that it's broken isn't even what bothers me, but the fact that it's chock full of stolen content does. Bottom line, don't give this person money.
6650	0	a	Is it a good game? No idea! Can't get past GFWL-login screen.
6651	0	a	It's a decent platformer, but I've played too many decent platformers to bother with one that doesn't have something unique to bring to the table. In this case the attempt at something unique seems to be unsubtle commentary about sexism in video games, but it doesn't really work, and with credit to Richard Cobbett of RPS, 'down that path goes most bad game parody â€“ joking about how crap something is, and then straight-up doing the crap thing instead of the trickier task of finding some way to subvert it.' Also, the sound gets annoying pretty fast. Go do some handstands instead; your shoulders will thank you.
6652	0	a	I wish I could give a 'barely thumbs down' on a graduated scale...  Nice ideas, nice scifi environment, nice music... But I personally just cannot get used to the explode-as-jumping mechanic. The fact that it uses inconsistent animations prevents me from getting a good feel for my movement.
6653	0	a	Ms Splosion Man is not a bad game, far from it. It never reached a point where it was explicitly bad, but unless you've beaten every other platformer under the sun. Your money is better spent elsewhere. The gameplay can't compare to the sheer number out there today. Also, the humor is funny during the intro and ending, in-between it's just obnoxious. I recommend muting and playing your own music over it.
6654	0	a	I wanted to like this game, but I couldn't get into the 'humor' that is an extreme stereotyping of a hyper teenage girl. The way it's implemented was so annoying, grating, and horrid that I couldn't even keep playing.  If you can ignore that, gameplay is pretty excellent.
6655	0	a	I really enjoy platforming games but I'm afraid that I can't recommend this one.  The game has a nice comedic art style, sound effects and music, but that can lose its charm when you have to redo an area 20 times in a row. The game can be more frustrating than fun in areas where you have to do millisecond perfect timing or you die and have to redo a lot.  If you die enough times without progressing than the game does allow you to skip forward to the next checkpoint, so I've been having more fun with the game ever since deciding to use that function whenever I get too annoyed.  The only reason I've played this game for so many hours is because I try not to uninstall games until after I've finished their singleplayer. Ultimately, I regret a lot of the time I spent on this game.  If you're into speed running than this game has some nice features and difficulty for you, but for people that just want a fun platformer, definitely don't get this game.
6656	0	a	This felt like a really annoying sequel to Splosion Man (which I've played on the 360). Frankly, I found the 'feminization' of the player character (the titular 'Ms. Splosion Man') to be absurdly sexist in the most casual manner possible -- making cheap jokes (which are really just visual gags, as it's a wordless game, so maybe I should cut them some slack). I just found the whole 'slap pink on it and toss in some horrific stereotypes about teenage girls etc' to be really grating.  I got it for something like $2.50, so it wasn't like I got horribly ripped off. The original is just... less obnoxious? Meh. Perhaps I'm just becoming old and jaded. I just found it really irksome.  If you really have a platformer itch that needs scratching, get Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams. That game is easily amongst the best platformers I have ever played. I play with a controller, so I'm not sure how convenient the keyboard setup is.  TL;DR -- competent, but the original didn't grate at my nerves with (likely unintentional) casual sexism and annoying cutscenes. Get Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams if you want a light-ish platformer that's fun to pick up and play whenever.
6657	0	a	Not as enjoyable as the first for a few reasons. 1) The bosses were disappointing and boring. 2) There were several maps that had trails of dead-end explosions that were simply trial and error to discover the right path which is never fun in a platformer. 3) Many of the levels simply dragged on for far too long with little to show for novelty or uniqueness. 4) There were multiple points in each level that simply felt like placeholders to make each area longer.  Points in its favor were most notably the soundtracks to the second world and when using Mandy as well as the use of cars. Overall, the game was pretty lackluster but worth a few dollars.
6658	0	a	The first thing you'll notice upon playing this game is that a lot of budget was spent on thousands of inane voice acted lines. The main character speaks them constantly, and the novelty wears off quickly.  The second thing you'll notice is that the levels and gameplay aren't really anything remarkable. Pity, that.
6659	0	a	Couldn't get-on with the humour or style - it's just trying to scrape your ears out of your head...  Controls - whilst mostly OK - do occasionally have a bit of a holiday - usually on long complex series of jumps which you have to repeat when they crap out.  In a world filled with platformers - ones which aren't 100% tight-as-a-drum in the control dept and which scream at you constantly are hard to recommend
6660	0	a	Not recommended at all. The controlls feel floaty and imprecise and contribute as much to you dying as screwing up. All momentum is brought to abrupt halts due to inconsistent level design that encourages trial and error and memorization over getting better. The sound design is absolutely dreadful, and I'd recommend anyone who plays this to just mute the entire game and play music you actually like because the 'voices' will drive you insane.  this game is great if you want to hear 'all the single ladies!' or 'I must increase my bust!' every twenty seconds, as you replay the same section of a level over because your slippery avatar can't land on a platform properly in a platformer.
6661	0	a	Hmm. It's got a style. The gameplay is hard, but not unfair. I just can't help but wonder, if I was female, would I be offended by this?
6662	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6663	0	a	This was a great game on the XBox. On the PC, it doesn't run and has never been patched. I'll update this if it ever gets fixed, but don't buy this game anytime soon.
6664	0	a	I like the idea, but the game is quite repetitive with frustrating puzzles and it wants to force you to keep on running and try to beat the levels quickly. Not quite my thing.
6665	0	a	I have to say, this is a difficult review. The game was fun and the mechanic delightful... but the character model and random noises of Ms. Splosion Man herself are so incredibly obnoxious that I had to stop. Solid controls, absolutely unbearable character design.
6666	0	a	This game is one of the hardest, if not THE HARDEST game i have ever played. It starts out fine, until you get to world 1-5. On the xbox port i couldn't even beat world 2, so you get an idea of the frustration that this game will give you. Have fun! In all seriousness the rest of the game is great but the difficulty is where the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hits the fan.
6667	0	a	At first, it was a cute game. I had a little difficulty with a level, so I used the in-game cheat, which came with the warning of a 'curse'. I didn't think anything of it. I jumped to the next checkpoint, per the in-game cheat, and lo and behold, the 'curse' is extra weight on the thighs. I immediately shut down the game - I will not play something that includes such a fat-shaming â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing, and I'm a little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that I actually paid for this game.
6668	0	a	Very possibly the most annoying game I've ever played, and the gameplay, at the beginning at least, doesn't do near enough for me to justify putting up with all the cliched and lolsorandom garbage that oozes out of every seeping crevice of this monstrosity. Played three levels and uninstalled.
6669	0	a	Hmmmm, Games for Windows Live, I thought that parasitic bit of junk was dead and lifeless but NO you have to use it to play this game....aaaaarrrgghh! What were they thinking?!  The game's okay, it really would be better if I'd used a 360 controller but via a keyboard it did work albeit less than ideal. However, the GfWL addition is enough to make me feel as if I'll never return to it and sooner or later will 'delete local content'.  Shame.
6670	0	a	.
6671	0	a	Uses Windows Live. Enough said.
6672	0	a	The humour is the worst boss.
6673	0	a	horrid games for windows live and the programmers themselves who 2 years later still havent figured out how to fix the near constant (every 10 mins) freezing on menus or during cutscenes, forum is full of this stuff.  fun game though, just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ everywhere
6674	0	a	A crappy difficult platformer jumping game developed by two people. Game can be explained by one word: 'difficult'.  At the begining of the game (intro), the developer actually tries to head on against the Unreal engine. Well, you have miserably failed.  This game 'IS' developed for female players in mind. This game is so difficult, all the female players will rage quit this game and won't touch your 'xbox' or PC again. The 'xbox' is in double quotation marks because this game was initially released for the xbox.  The game is totally trial and error based, so you are going to die and learn what lies ahead, then respawn from a check point, to repeat what you just did 20 seconds ago in a loop until you could get to the end point of a level.  The worst of all is that the QTE has no indication, you will just have to figure it by yourself. Although I said QTE, it is either barrels or switches that require precisely timed button press.  If I were you, I won't look at this crappy game. Go play something else. Save your time, save your mentality.
6675	0	a	Tl:dr at the end.  Ok, you probably went here to the Negetive side to see down sides of the game however most of the negetive reviewes are either:  A go back to the positve side or,  B gets boring fast.  So here is an actual review that will show the downsides of the game but, know that i did really enjoy the game, its one of my favorite games but here is just the downside.  Bad instructions for beginners. Its pretty hard to get into when your new. Having a friend showing you the basics helps. But you will spend alot of time looking at wikis to figure out what to do. Some people may like it since you get to explore. However you will probably miss huge chunks of the games content.  It also has alot of useful items only obtainable threw RNG. *cough* cellphone *cough*  One slighly more minor thing is that somtimes. Your world or characters may get corrupted. This usually never happens but if it does there is no way to recover them. However this rarely happens. I have only gotten a character lost once without mods.  One thing if you do get the game. DONT GET ITEMS FROM OTHER PEOPLE. It does severly ruins the game. If you play multiplayer, make sure you either play with another new player. Or somone who is willing to start over. This game is about the journey not the destination.  People who do say this game gets boring fast have gotten items from other people.  TL:DR  I LOVE THIS GAME. HOWEVER HERE ARE JUST FLAWS AND I PUT IT IN NEGETIVE TO SHOW DOWNSIDES. ODDS ARE YOU WILL LOVE THIS STILL.  1. RNG 2. BAD INSTRUCTIONS 3. SOMTIMES CORRUPTS WORLDS AND CHARACTERS
6676	0	a	You're probably here to look for the counter-arguments against Terraria, but is frustrated to find only dumb or fake reviews telling you 'just buy it/what are you doing viewing negative for terrria lmao lol kk'. Well, I'm here to tell the truth, and while there aren't many cons to terraria, the three main things you need to take into consideration:   - Dies out kinda fast when playing alone. A lot of the replayability comes from the fun of playing with another person, trying community maps, etc. May not apply to everyone, but applies to me and my friends so I would take that into consideration if you intend to only play Singleplayer.  - Poor compatibility with new OS versions, frequent break reports every time a new OS version is released.  - Requires guiding from the internet or another player because just like Minecraft or Garry's Mod, it has no intent in helping you whatsoever. May not be a negative if you like that kind of stuff, but it does require commitment and some people don't like it so it's good to take that into consideration.  Just taking this out of my stomach. This is not a negative review per se, I still think Terraria is an amazing game despite these three flaws (look at my playtime!), but this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is seriously â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off.
6677	0	a	I found it needlessly time-consuming. It's just not high-paced enough for me. This game just offers too little for its time. Sandbox is good, but that doesn't mean it should be completely purposeless. And it's WAY TOO slow paced. If you enjoy it, great. I'm just voicing my opinion that it's not for me.
6678	0	a	Attention! The passage below is written by a  Chinglish man with poor grammar . I am so sorry about providing a direcommendation because I just want offcial team observe it.Terraria is a excellent game that attracts many Chinese game players include me.I have already recommended it to many friends but it failed because Terraria doesn't have  CHINESE LOCALIZATION .So I request Terraria can provide Chinese localization.That's the same wish of our huge number of Chinese players.If Terraria supports Chinese local work,I think this game will have a sales volume increase.Local private Chinese localization can't deal with such frequent edition updating.  Even about that more and more Chinese perfer to choose piracy so that private Chinese localization won't be diavailable when updating.   I suppose it's my right to require a Chinese edition and Terraria also can benefit from offical Chinese localization. I hope more people can support my requestion. Another problem I want to state is new player will be confused about the begining of the game:What should I do?Where should I go?The help of guide is lack for new gamer.It will cause some players have no interest quickly if they don't have patience to explore more about the game.How to attract new players is important.  It is still a excellent game that I nominate Terraria for 'Stand the Test of Time'award.

6686	0	a	This is a thumbs down for all the people who HAVE NOT got this game                                                                Get it
6687	0	a	Game can be fun at times when bored. But due to the fact my friend lost all his hard earned gear and grinded hours I don't think i'll be joining back into this game as updates can make you loose hard earned Characters. 
6688	0	a	Terraria is a nice game ,but for whatever reason i couldnt bring myself to like it
6689	0	a	People keep comparing this game to Minecraft. I don't get why.  They are totally different games, and that is mostly because you would play them for different reasons. Minecraft is a sandbox. This is not.   So let me say this game is really good.  Sometimes...  So lets look this over, shall we?  PROS: -Bosses mostly cool, but the mechanical bosses are just annoying reskins with more health. Skeletron is a big magic skeleton with a skull and two arms which get killed individually. Skeletron Prime is a metal skeleton with a butt-ton of health, a skull and 4 arms, one with a ranged attack. -Big waves of enemy battles at certain random events that are very fun. A ton of different enemies going on a seige to your base while you smash all of them with cool weapons. The events weild good rewards and can be summoned too. -Different reigons and randomly generated loot, makes exploring worth it. -Multiple stratagies and playstyles.  CONS: -Some bosses are just reskins with more hp. -Getting ore starts feeling grindy after you find all generated structures. -Exploring loses purpose after you reach hardmode, as most items you can find become obsolete. -Relies too heavily on finding randomly generated items, events, bosses, and structures. RNG hell. -Pre-Mechanical bosses, Post-Hardmode, is extremely grindy, finding huge ammounts of ores, grinding for boss spawners, building big platforms for boss-fights(Yes, you have to build boss-battle arenas yourself.) -Game is super easy, if you know how to cheese every boss (Which is often through random experimenting.) -Game doesn't tell you what to do, so unless you read every page on the wiki, figuring out what to do is hell. -Expert mode gives new content! But doing it in singleplayer is hyper-grindy and every boss is insane. -Relies too heavily on finding randomly generated items, events, bosses, and structures. (I had to say it again.)     So now, a story about me playing the game.  I played through expert mode until wall of flesh, where I had to build a giant bridge across the whole map, find someone else to play with me, or give up expert mode. So I gave up expert mode, beat the wall of flesh in normal mode, and then got bored because I now have to grind for a rare ore. I came back a while later, and got stuck on the mechanical bosses because I had to grind for more gear.  Gave up for a couple months, but a friend tells me to try again.  I come back, beat the mechanical bosses, and things start going my way. Need a enemy drop for a crafting ingredient.  Grind the enemy for days, kill over 200 of the same enemy.  Never find the ingredient I need.  Come back next morning.  My save data is corrupted and I have to start almost all over.  ---  It's good at some of what it does, and it's fun when the game gets it right.  But when the game fails, this game is a fetid repulsive infected corrosive pile of dog crap.  UPDATE: I gave this game another chance. And it corrupted my save data A SECOND TIME. I am done with this game.

6694	0	a	i have a problem witht this game for some reason i dont have my guy that has 500hp also has all my good stuff on him plz fix terria or give back my 20dollards 
6695	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6696	0	a	I think the game could be amazing. Sadly, it seems i have terrible luck, because on my world (which is on normal difficulty), the game would glitch out during boss battles and crash. That would leave me in the middle of nowhere, fighting a boss with nothing on my character as my items were destroyed. 
6697	0	a	Very boring after awhile and my game got corrupted so I had to restart and that was very annoying 2/5

6706	0	a	Amazing Game. but since 1.3 came out, there have been only bug fixes, but i know the devs are pouring their hearts into the next update. But the reason the game is a thumbs down for me boils down to one reason: the bunnies. THE BUNNIES ARE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

6710	0	a	ok so something happened and now i cant play terraria. I had 121 hours on it, and was *this* close to beating the moon lord to pieces. Now, all it shows is a white screen and i cant see. it plays title theme music, and i can hear myself switching options on the screen, BUT I CANT SEE A DARN THING! someone please help me! i love terraria so much, and if i cant play it, oooh... i wont be happy. for now, I DONT RECCOMEND THIS! IT DOESNT WORK UNTIL SOMEONE HELPS! then i will recommend it.
6711	0	a	2 bugs. one is the unexpected errors and the other one is the laggy game while it has never done that before. i would like for the one who made terraria to please fix it. i kept on trying everything to help to make it better but nothing worked. i would appreciate it.
6712	0	a	could not play the coop online, is not as easy as starbound to join the game... didnt like that...
6713	0	a	A lot of people like it. I'm not one of those. I enjoy Minecraft more. To me, it's like a 2D minecraft, and I just can't get into it.  You may like it, and there is nothing wrong with that. I just couldn't get into it.
6714	0	a	just downloaded it not even a week ago and it dosent even launch
6715	0	a	Cant even launch the game
6716	0	a	fun but crashes every second

6720	0	a	this games delets your game every time you exit out and i dont know why and uninstalled it from your pc
6721	0	a	After I was able to get this game working without crashing (never got the gamepad to work as well as K/M), I was left with the awful feeling of boredom the entire time I was playing. And not being able to speed up time through the night? LAME Even though I didn't care for it, Steamworld Dig is better if you want to go mining.
6722	0	a	my world dose not work it says this is a invalid operation in this state help i gave this game 0 stars because it sucks do not waste your money on this

6724	0	a	im stuck at 100% and it keeps saying i have 20 minutes to 4 hours left... i have ethernet and good internet
6725	0	a	how do i get refund my son had downloaded this game with out permision
6726	0	a	From the first time I played this game, I did not like it. I tried to give it a chance, and kept it a little longer hoping maybe it would grow on me, and it has not. And now that very thing, trying to give the game a chance, according to Steam means I am not allowed to get a refund. So now, I have a worthless game sitting in my Library, reminding me how much of a waste of money it was.   I do not recommend this game, and based on Steam's reaction to a loyal gamer requesting money back for a game they will never again touch beyond the 1 hour they have already, in order to buy a game in the future they WILL use: I do not recommend it unless you ARE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE you are going to be in love with it.
6727	0	a	every time i try to load it is crashes and says my frame work is not working 
6728	0	a	i cant get into the game anymore it will not let me can i have my money back please or if you can fix it that will be great.

6733	0	a	I dont know if i am the only one but i cant play the game and i bought it
6734	0	a	I tryed to open the game after buying it a few minutes ago. upon clicking play it had about 1 second where it said 'opening terraria' then, it said running next to the app but it never showed up on my computer.

6736	0	a	It's a pretty fun game, too bad you lose all of your characters with each new update.
6737	0	a	Drop rates for everything are too low. Don't play unless you want to end up frustrated and in a bad mood.  I hate this game so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad.
6738	0	a	This game is very cool BUT when i play like for 3-5 minutes on fullscreen it crashes my computer :( I can only play on windowed and NOT EVEN ON ALL SCREEN -_- Does somebody have a solution??????
6739	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6740	0	a	This Game used to be amazing with my friend but since 1.3.4 multiplayer has became WAY too laggy. DO NOT GET UNLESS YOU HAVE INTERNET THAT IS AMAZING AND ALIENWARE OR BETTER PC. though it still fun on singleplayer. 6/10
6741	0	a	Why are you looking at this? There isn't anything bad about this game.. GO BUY IT.
6742	0	a	Unfortunately this is one of those promising-looking games I just never got into. The long and the short of it is that I got bored - maybe it's that I was playing alone, maybe it's that I'm too used to narrative-based games, maybe it's that when I was playing this I lacked the imagination or engagement to 'make my own fun'. Don't get me wrong - I've enjoyed many an hour with Minecraft - but something about this never clicked with me. Progression felt damnably slow (admittedly, I did not spend long with the game) and I found myself constantly referencing wikis when it would have been much nicer to just lose myself in the pixelly world.  Ten hours disappeared pretty quickly, but I ultimately decided this wasn't the game for me.  PS: Y'all going into the 'not recommended' section just to downvote reviews need a better hobby.
6743	0	a	The game's got potential... If you waste 10 hours a day, Getting items, Ofcourse.  But... Well... I don't like it much, I don't recomend it to people with low patience.  God, I feel like this won't help anyone.
6744	0	a	  when ever i go on it crashes
6745	0	a	I bought this game on sale because it looked great. got it all downloaded and tried running it. it will not run on windows 10. but otherwise its probably gonna be a great game once i get it working

6751	0	a	WHY THE F IS ALL MY STUFF GONE?!  ALL OF MY HARD WORK IS GONE! FIX THIS PLEASE!!!!
6752	0	a	There is only one way to describe this game: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥ â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

6755	0	a	Let me get this traight. I love this game. It has a lot of options, and is alot of fun. have ALOT of hours on this game. I have beaten it many times, and enjoy each time. BUT, my characters and worlds disapear. Many others have this issue. Its happened to 4 characters, and 2 worlds. 3 of the characters of them being completely endgame. Other people have this issue, and have been having it for over a year. And yet, there still hasn't been a fix. Why? Please fix this. Its a waste of my time. If it is fixed, then i will definitly give it a thumbs up. But, as of now, it's a thumbs down.  -Cas
6756	0	a	I think this is a pretty cool game to some people. But not to me so...
6757	0	a	Good game.. but Corrupted world and player data is so common and very annoying, nice way to make the game longer! no.
6758	0	a	not for mac
6759	0	a	I have tried everything that people have suggested but my game still isn't working, I press play, it says it's loading and then nothing happens, I checked in task manager to see if it was loading, it wasn't :(
6760	0	a	it's sh*t it does'nt let me play it says 'please launch the game from your steam client'
6761	0	a	WTH i had so much stuff AND I LOST ALL MY CHARACTERS AND WORLDS i stil have achievements but nothing els!!! im so mad right now
6762	0	a	I'm not friends with you anymore Terraria
6763	0	a	I wrealy like this game because it is just cool
6764	0	a	Good game but gets boaring very quickly.Sorry to all you terraria lovers but it's just so boaring.I mean like once you beat moonloard (Wich takes like 1 month) it gets boaring and you just wait till and update.Overall good game but gets boaring.
6765	0	a	Looked interesting and I liked the premise. That was before I played it long enough to realize that it's like having your teeth drilled, except the dentist keeps bringing out bigger drills. Then when it's time to leave instead of a toothbrush, he pulls human hair and a lighter out of his pocket , sets it aflame in his hand, and then rubs his smelly burnt hair finger across you upper lip, moving in closer, and whispering in your ear 'game is bad.'
6766	0	a	i wanted to kms
6767	0	a	  Although it does bring back the retro style in gaming and with sprites and older graphics this game is personally not one of my favorite games, now I must say this, I did not feel engaged in the game. This game will eat you up and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you out as if you were just a prune. I did enjoy Halloween where you could get goodie bags and open up these bags to get really cool items but the bosses and a lot of gameplay aspects were just criptic. Last and least making houses for NPCs is a pain in your shiney metal â™¥â™¥â™¥. I do have to admit there were some great gameplay aspects and it was actually a really good idea as it also used sprites and had a great Soundtrack. I hanve to give this game a 4/10.
6768	0	a	please launch game from steam client
6769	0	a	this game will not workkkk i spent 9 dollars for this thing that does not even work. 
6770	0	a	This game destroyed my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing house completely because the biome changed and my whole house looked like it was covered in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing period blood.   I like this game, but when it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s with my effort, this game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nightmare.

6776	0	a	its fun for like a good 5 minutes... then it gets bad
6777	0	a	deletes stuff for no reason, im very mad sent my christmas break playing and lost it all. Great job obama... thank god we have trump.
6778	0	a	bs it says that terarria has stopped working talk about a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing $9 rip off in other words this game sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ i can even get to the main menue let alone open the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game if someone can help me...unlikely as that is i would appreciate it.
6779	0	a	Potentially created by the computer mouse industry to wear out buttons via exhaustive clicking.
6780	0	a	I Gave this game A Dislike Because i Could Even know this game is Amazing
6781	0	a	1.3 sucks terribly. Any mod dev will tell you that.
6782	0	a	It is a really fun game, but it is unplayable with Windows 10. Usually it'll crash during loading saying there is a lack of memory, and if it does complete loading, it will sometimes just stop processing graphics for a second and generate them all at once. But it did work perfectly well for Windows 7. If I can play Overwatch without issue, this game should be easily handled.
6783	0	a	i got this not to long ago about 1 year ago but yesterday i had some lag and restarted then i didnt play it again for the day wake up today and find out MY PLAYER IS GONE!!! my worlds are there just not my player i love this game and my friend is geting it but i got full hearts and mana i cant do enything to get it back help pleae ;-;
6784	0	a	The most frustrating part of Terraria is 2 things: 1. the lack of explanation and guidelines, i shouldnt have to look up a guide to start the game! 2: the insane difficulty in the first hours of playing. why do i always get killed by an eyeball when the game doesnt even tell me how to make a wall! why was that so hard for me to accomplish! but thats not why im writing this review, im writing this review becasue of the 2 save corruptions this game gave me, first my chris character, and then my world. Stea wont even refund me for the terrible time i have had. this game isnt bad by all means its just the one of the hardest games to get into, it becomes that game that you just leave on to leave it on, im mixed about this personally since i didnt find it enjoyable but dont let me terrible review stop you, this is just my biased opinion, since i cant enjoy the game anymore. it wont even let me make a person to start the game anymore, this is why im downrating it. To hard to get into and i cant even enjoy it anymore. Please fix the save state problem
6785	0	a	I love this game,however it has deleted 3 of my characters and 4 worlds making it very frustrating to play
6786	0	a	Just bought this game the other day. Binge played it and it was awesome. Woke up this morning to my character and world completely deleted. Searched solutions online and nothing worked. Absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.
6787	0	a	nothing likes windows 10
6788	0	a	Well, it was a good game until I lose a world and character approaching endgame events. Also, it sucks that there's no fix to corrupted characters and worlds when so many people have this problem. Anyway, I'm done with this until this is fixed. 1/10
6789	0	a	my cheracters are getting deleted out of nowhere. and now they wont give me a refund.
6790	0	a	Trust me this game is fun, but if you exit the game while it is autosaving(you dont know when) or if you close it via task manager then your world will be corrupted and you cant load it anymore. I was well into Hardmode when this happened, i killed the Destroyer of Worlds and got the clementinator. Now all of that is gone.
6791	0	a	With My 5 Minutes Of Playtime , And My Expertie's Id Say This Game Is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ XD

6797	0	a	dont like the aspepect and feel of the game  
6798	0	a	when it first came out it was awsome but then the developers keep adding new bosses, armor and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when i finnally got the most OP weapon in the game, suprise. its weak now and theres an even stronger one rinse and repeat i am very far in this game like balls and guess what? bosses spawn evrey night. you cant even beat them if your not prepared. and your never prepared get starbound, at least its community doesnt throw up new content onto it like a seasick sailor
6799	0	a	  This game is boring af. Don't get it
6800	0	a	I have four hours in this game? I never remember caring enough to figure out the multiplayer, so that's probably all in the main menu.
6801	0	a	it sucks
6802	0	a	its boring, its just minecraft in 2d but if you are a fan of survival and building then this might be interestingi for you but its just weird and boring
6803	0	a	Having played Minecraft, this just felt underwhelming.
6804	0	a	One time me and my friend played a normal survival game of this, we became better and better, suddenly we killed a boss, and then the biome changed ALOT. It was so bad, and our house got completely destroyed. And our effort to our house and materials was like 2 weeks. NOT RECOMMENDED!

6813	0	a	Easy game, Expert mode is not a threat.    On the other side, it has a collecting value and its satisfying to get everything.  TmodLoader Is also good.
6814	0	a	My collecters edition wont spawn the bunny pet help plez 
6815	0	a	I WISH I LIKE IT, BUT I JUST CANT
6816	0	a	This game is just horrible. this is my 2nd time buying it (first time was on ps3) and i dont know what i was thinking. this game has akward clunky controls, super annoying enemy respawn rates, horrible music and sfx (guy sounds like a baby coughing when he gets damaged??) and tiny little items that are almost impossible to make out what they are unless you hover over top of them with the cursor. i have no idea why this game has such a huge following and it drives me nuts that i spent money on it twice. I kept hopeing it was better than i rerembered it being, but sadly it was even worse. I seriously have no idea why people like this game so much there is litterally nothing fun about it.
6817	0	a	I really wish I could give this game a thumbs up, I really do. It was fun, addicting and interesting, however due to some issues that I could not resolve I lost all my data, characters and even the world I worked so hard on. As all the time put into this was for granted.
6818	0	a	I have played Terraria for 42 hours and I still don't really enjoy the game. The game is alright but there are so many items and things in the game that it makes everything extreamly complicated. When you first start a world the game is all about survival but once you get further the game is all about combat. You can build amazing things in the game but that is very hard to do. When ever I do a single player world I never get to far before I get bored.   So basically only get this game if you like lots of combat because thats the best part of this game.
6819	0	a	This game is rubbish. Just go play Starbound: the physically superior game. I know im entitled to my own opinion but my opinion is right. c:
6820	0	a	too much fun
6821	0	a	If you like 2d games, this game is perfect for you, personaly i would not reccomend it, but if im going to look at the graphics and things u can do in this game, its awesome and worth ur time.
6822	0	a	sure there is much to do in this game, and you would enjoy it with friends but it would take so much effort to get a nice weapon or equipment, there is many rare items for no reason other than make the experience longer, i would prefer if there was creative mode or couple of dedicated servers but there isn't, to sum it up it is like any survival/randomly generated world game and it gets boring fast

6838	0	a	I find this boring....  It reminds me of minecraft but more limited. NO Creative... NO ability to make maps. It pains me. it really does.  2D minecraft.
6839	0	a	Overall, Terreria is decent. It's not hugely amazing but the world is large and there is plenty to do. The thing I don't like is the combat. I know that it's hard to get good combat in a survival adventure but the combat in this game sucks. Not because it's challenging (which it can be) but because it's bland. Also, it's way too hard for early players. 4/10.
6840	0	a	If you have ADHD
6841	0	a	this game is horrible.  every time i play this game  i get so far but for SOME RESONE IT KEAPS DELEITING MY F$%#ING FILE
6842	0	a	Terraria is a side-scrolling crafting and adventure game. Bases can be built, locations explored, items crafted. Unfortunately there is no clear incentive to play this clunky mess of a game. The crafting UI is terrible, the help system completely useless, and the community are rabid in their defense of their darling game.  Avoid this and play something that is fun instead.
6843	0	a	Played 20 hours of the game in 3 days, only for all my files to get deleted, and when I put my file back in my game from the recycle bin, the files got compressed and unusable, if you like depression I rate this game a funking 10
6844	0	a	I Couldn't play this game for a year because it was extremely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing broken to the point of which it became unplayable. When I did play, my first guy's file became corrupt losing a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of work and OP items. My second guy got deleted after trying to delete my world but it instead deleted my character and my world that I had 'deleted' was still there. This game is extremely broken, poorly made, Laggy, and unfun in every way possible.
6845	0	a	forgot to rate... positive, POSITIVE :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TERRARIA FOREVS after some little 100 hours. But less better than starbound

6851	0	a	I've spent 62 hours on this game, gathering materials and fighting bosses. I've defeated the Moon Lord many times and filled a lot of chests with very useful items. Recently when I started up my game, the world did not load in correctly. I can't open my map and it's just a blank screen. All my chests are ruined and my other worlds load up just fine. I can't believe I wasted my money on a game where it bugs out all the time like this.
6852	0	a	i think at one point i liked it
6853	0	a	Stop scrolling through the negative reviews and go back to the positive one!
6854	0	a	I had a lot of friends really pushing me to play this game and some great experiences, but overall it was honestly pretty boring. There might be some fun things to do on servers, but if you play with other people you either will want to start from the game's boring beginning stage or limit their items. Otherwise, they'll just bring in completely overpowered items and ruin the game. There are just too many ways to exploit the games and make the bosses more challenging than they should be. I still love the way the boss fights are designs (especially the queen bee) and there is just so much creativity in the items. I had the most fun when I was fighting them with minimal preparation, hopping into swarms of enemies unprepared, organizing my chests, and making a secret base. Some servers also have cool minigames. I'd recommend the game if you want to build and just goof off with friends, but not if you want to play alone.
6855	0	a	  I was already a fan of the creator's (Redigit) previous work which was a fangame called 'Super Mario Bros. X' Years ago (2011), I learned that Regedit released another game known today as Terraria. I was hyped and bought this game on the official website. It was everything I thought and more and I was deeply in love with it. I stopped playing for a few years just so I can see it evolve more and more. In 2016, I got this game as an early birthday present and started playing again. Hyped for what this game has become, I played a few hours of single player. The game felt different, and in a bad way. Everything that made it simple and fun now is grindy and complicated. In this 'new' Terraria you basically grind to get better 'toys' Everything seems too complicated and you need a guide for everything. The game isn't beginner friendly and you can become overwhelmed by the amount of things that you should be doing. The game punishes you for being ignorant, and only the wise ones can actually enjoy the game.   I really (really) tried to like this new Terraria, but it never satisfied me like the old version. Rating: 6/10

6861	0	a	This game is horrible. Absolutely disgusting. I wasted hours of my life trying to make my character's skin color the same as the elf helmet's ears, and it can't be done. Horrible, disgraceful, and not worth existing.
6862	0	a	Bought multiple copies but the multiplayer is a bit laggy even over the network. I enjoy the single-player game but, honestly, the console version is the way to go for no-lag multiplayer with the kiddos
6863	0	a	Meh... gets repetitive. I've played through it twice and now get no satisfaction in playing it.
6864	0	a	i downloading this game and its stucks at 100 procents
6865	0	a	Complete waste of time and effort. I paid less than five dollars for this game and I still feel ripped off
6866	0	a	its like fallout with guns
6867	0	a	I love this game!! it has unlimted hours of adventure and the items and boss battle are amazing but i spent over 20 hours on a world and all of sudden ... it just dissapears. This is why i am now going to stop playing because all of my hard work has just gone because of the stupid save system that messes up and loses your characters or worlds. Its dissapointing because it such a good game and i wil miss playing it but after losing my world i dont want to be dissapointed again when i lose another world.
6868	0	a	why play this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when you can read the entire bee movie script   According to all known laws of aviation,    there is no way a bee should be able to fly.    Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.    The bee, of course, flies anyway    because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.    Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.    Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.    Barry! Breakfast is ready!    Ooming!    Hang on a second.    Hello?    - Barry? - Adam?    - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.    Looking sharp.    Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.    Sorry. I'm excited.    Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.    A perfect report card, all B's.    Very proud.    Ma! I got a thing going here.    - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!    - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.    - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.    Never thought I'd make it.    Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.    - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.    Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That's why we don't need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pompâ€¦ under the circumstances.    - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!    - Bee-men. - Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.    Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class ofâ€¦    â€¦9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick ourjob today?    I heard it's just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know asâ€¦    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.    - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.    - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.    - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey    that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.    What's the difference?    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you'll just work us to death?    We'll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    â€œWhat's the difference?â€ How can you say that?    One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We're bees.    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I've never seen them this close.    They know what it's like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don't come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.    Their day's not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.    Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?    Distant. Distant.    Look at these two.    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!    - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.    What were you doing during this?    Trying to alert the authorities.    I can autograph that.    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?    Yeah. Gusty.    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.    - Six miles, huh? - Barry!    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.    - Maybe I am. - You are not!    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you're interested in?    - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!    - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!    Wait till you see the sticks I have.    I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!    Let's open some honey and celebrate!    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.    Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody â€œdawgâ€!    I'm so proud.    - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.    Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.    Yeah, right.    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removalâ€¦    - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!    One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.    - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!    Wow!    Oouple of newbies?    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What's available?    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey's always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up.

6878	0	a	It's actually a good game, I recommend, BUT the only problem is that only gets good if:  - You go searching on a wiki how to do stuff  - Play a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lot  - Have someone to play with you*  - You don't cheat  *Someone that's starting with you  So, that's why I personally don't like this game. But I can't say it's bad and/or don't recommend for you. Maybe you like...  AND YES, 18 HOURS ISN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE THE GAME 'GOOD'  I rate it 7/10 because it has a lot of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to do.

6880	0	a	EDIT: If you honestly just go to negative reviews to downvote everything, you need PROFESSIONAL help. I can recommend a few psychiatrists.  My review created a few confusions, so I'm just going to put this warning here: THESE HERE ARE NOT FACTS. THESE ARE MY OPINIONS ABOUT THE GAME, AND CHANGE OF PLAYSTYLE CAN REMOVE SOME THING I STATED IN HERE.  I wanted to love this game. I really did. I heard great things about it- A great game where possibilities are endless!  At least that's what I thought. Now, I am a Minecraft fan (and a Garry's Mod fan, if that matters) and I can see why I liked Minecraft and not this In the game, you only have two things to do: Survive or build. Done surviving? Go build. Done building? Restart. Getting sick of doing the same thing over and over again? Too bad, there is nothing else this game offers. Don't get me wrong, I can see why some people may like this game. But it gets repetitive INSANELY quick. Go craft that, go kill that, go craft that, go kill that, etc. (Also dont attack me saying 'THERE IZ DAT 2 DUU!!!1!', I get bored way too fast to even reach doing 'that'.)  Another giant problem is the complete lack of help. While this also applies for Minecraft, it doesn't have a giant content like Terraria does, therefore in your entire playtime you will only need to check the crafting recipes and how to get to other dimensions. However, in terraria, you need to look up EVERYTHING as the game literally refuses to help you. In my 19 hour playtime, I had to look at the wiki at least 20 times just to figure out what my next move would be, and if I didn't look up on a wiki I did not move forward at all.  Another thing is that I am not a guy who can play a multiplayer game singleplayer. What I mean by that, If a game has multiplayer option, I will not have fun playing the Singleplayer knowing that I have an option to play with others. In Minecraft there are servers with THOUSANDS of players, and it's quite easy to find a friend or two that you can play together. However in Terraria, the most I've seen on a server is 20 players, and since the world is HUGE you barely even see any players at all. I could play with a friend, but again the repetitive and the no-help thing ruins it.  TL;DR A great game, but it does not have any plans to help you at all, and you do the same stuff over and over again.  EDIT 2: Apparently, people think this review is a troll or just completely wrong, for some reason. so I'm just gonna clear things up more here. I didn't know expressing opinions were considered 'trolling'. If you can't respect other people's opinions, I suggest you get off of reviews since you can't handle anything that doesn't agree with what you say.  Also , have you noticed the fact that in every single things you listed, it either  A) Tells you to make your own achievements. Which I can't. Call me achievement addict, but if you don't give me a goal to progress towards, I wont have fun. Not to mention this game doesn't give you any information what-so-ever, so I can't even figure out how to do the said challenges in the first place. And: B) Tells you to play co-op. I said this in the original review, but I'll say it again. I tried to play co-op 1) on a multiplayer server, which didn't work out at all since the most crowded server has like 20 players they don't seem to care about surviving and would rather kill you over and over aain, and 2) I don't have any IRL friends that play Terraria, and if you check my friend's list you will see that all of them have hours upon hours of playtime in terraria, so I'm pretty sure they'd facepalm 100 times if they spend 10 minutes playing terraria with me, not to mention at this point they even very rarely play Terraria.  Also, one last thing: Have you noticed that in every single thing you listed, none of them actually change the way I play the game? The only thing that can solve the lack of help is playing co-op, and I told you why that can't happen.
6881	0	a	This game leaves you with nothing in the end, please consider getting a better more content filled game such as starbound
6882	0	a	I wish I could say Terraria is good, but it just gets so mundane and monotonous. you will spend hours of your time standing or running in one direction holding down left click with a loud, constant, and overpowering banging of a gun. Most of the difficulty can be rooted down to a DPS race.
6883	0	a	it's s h i t
6884	0	a	Is like comic book. If you started from the begining and continue, is good. Start now, have to play Kachup and takes long time. Is stupid, I dont like it.   Buy game now? nah. Buy game when it 1st came out? Dah.  Is Good, but not for new comer.
6885	0	a	i played terraria all night then i played on my laptop on the same steam account but none of my stuff was there and i went back to my computer and my character was deleted somehow
6886	0	a	Played for 42 minutes, 41 of which were spent on the wiki looking up crafting recipes, and find out how to perform very basic tasks, such as building things. Apparently there's no way in-game to see what materials you need for a craft unless you already HAVE the materials for the craft. Or maybe there IS some way in the game to find recipes... but only god and the developers know where it is, and neither seem too keen on helping new players find it.   I'm not asking to have my hand held, but there's a line between 'difficult' and 'poorly designed', and depending on how much free time you have, this game can go either way.   If you've got hours to spend reading wikis and figuring things out then go for it, judging by this game's score it's probably a very rewarding experience. If you're like me and have limited time, try Starbound instead. It's a lot more forgiving on new/casual players, and has a much easier learning curve.
6887	0	a	better on console, not that I prefer console on most things, but its just not as unnecessarily hard, plus, ocram.
6888	0	a	Great game...but for ME, personally, it got boring after a while. I don't even play it anymore. The thought of it alone makes me bored.  It's basically a side scrolling Minecraft, in a way. Though it is still very much its own thing. However....that's just it. SIDE SCROLL. There's only so much you can do and so far you can travel away from your house when there's only 2 directions to go. Other people seem to really like this game, though. So maybe you shouldn't take my word for it. If you got a patient and imaginative mind, and are the kind of gamer that's super addicted to Minecraft, then perhaps it's the game for you. If you got 10 bucks to kill, then I say go for it. However, my experience is it is boring after a little while. I wish I could have my money back....But hey, on the bright side, at least I HAVE it, and it's in my library in case my friends ever want to play it, lol.
6889	0	a	This one's not for me. I dislike that there's no real instructions or goal. The world is huge and if there was any kind of structure to it I would probably love it. I played a bit with a friend who loves this game but it just doesn't really appeal to me.
6890	0	a	I spend ten hours of gameplay grinding ores and such at the start, and what do I get?  More stuff to grind after deafeating the wall of flesh!  Not to mention that after you destroy the wall of flesh, there is nothing else to do but look at a couple of new enemies and defeat boss after boss after grinding for a few hours to defeat it.  Occasionally, you'll get an event or two, but even those can be triggered by the player somehow, making it a sort of 'boss'   Other than that, it's really just a grind to kill this or that to get a new item simulator.  P.S. If you do plan on playing mutiplayer, make sure its with a freind and not some random guy because he will either: A: greif your world or B: Give you the most high tier â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and basically win the game for you.
6891	0	a	This game is really bad, the game wears off and waters down quick. Cheaters are everywhere, and you cant find a server with people playing legit. This game is seriously not worth the money, go buy gmod instead.
6892	0	a	I got this game hoping it would be awesome but everytime i try to play it freezes and then it wont let me exit the game i would not recommend downiloading this game.
6893	0	a	I bought this game when I was 11 and now I am no longer interested in it anymore. I last played because my younger brother had forced me to give him things that I had used cheats to recieved. Basicaly, do not play games with your obnoxious narcasistic siblings.
6894	0	a	Good game but everytime i have a far character it gets corrupt
6895	0	a	Don't even bother trying to make a new character and working really hard on it. I had 200+ hours on a good character and world and it corrupted. I don't recommend this game because you might waste your time just like I did. Great job Terraria.
6896	0	a	So when I bought this game it was so much fun. As I thought it would be like minecraft but no i realised its no where close to Minecraft this is how this game works. 1) Brake Blocks 2) Create tools 3) Build house 4) Mine 5) End up dying  6) Kill bosses 7) NOTHING ELSE TO DO I still loved doing the whole process for 1 to 6.
6897	0	a	start is very boring I keep getting told it gets good but I don't plan on playing through boring bs just for the potential to have fun when I can just go play another game.
6898	0	a	It's meh
6899	0	a	Downloaded Terraria  Played with friend for 1 week  Finished all content  Uninstalled  Forgot about.  dont buy this, its meh at best.
6900	0	a	It's boring, but it has cool stuff.
6901	0	a	I HATE THIS GAME!
6902	0	a	I want to make this a constructive review rather than just an angry rant on how it frustrates me. So here it goes.  I have poured many hours of my time into this game, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, the tier levels, the styles, the bosses, I loved it. I had only just defeated the second to last boss before i had encountered the problems which now make me resent this game.   Me and my friend who had many many items, were suddenly (what seemed to feel like) spammed with three events in succession. With no breaks. And they werent just the simple, easy events. These were the topmost, hardest enemies that i had ever encountered.   I admit that i have had this problem before with events seeming to appear too often, but i simply overlooked them and tried to enjoy what was happening. But the straw that broke the camels back was when both me and my friends connection could not be established or maintained, due to the shear amount of action going on with both our game sessions. Both our games inevitably ended up crashing, and everything that was left on the floor was despawned. After coming back on immediately afterwards, we go to see most of our top tier gear had disappeared. This was the point of no return, my friend uninstalled his game, and I am left with a bitter hatred for the games unfair mechanics and need to punish the player at any given turn.  I don't wish to see comments complaining that my computer simply isnt powerful enough to run the game, but it has been fine up until this point. I am sure that this is not happening in isolation. I want this to be constructive in the hopes that this issue can be rectified.... because i really like this game, but i cannot tolerate how unfair it treats its players.
6903	0	a	A lot of content, too much content some might say, A lot of artistic quality, Cheap to buy, 90% of the Community cheats. 10% of the community plays legitimately.  The game is good, if you are that 10%. But for 90% of you, it's going to suck.
6904	0	a	This game is a very fun game for anyone who is starting terraria. When I first got the original version (PC version) of terraria I didn't know what to do, even after I had played the IOS version. Here is a basic guide for any newcomers.  1 gather some wood. 2 look around. There is certainly going to be some small caverns with chests in it. ( At the start of the game, all resources matter) 3 make a workbench 4 make some walls and build a shelter. 5 gather some stone and kill some slimes to make a furnace. ( the slime is to make torches) 6 gather some ore.   This game is so much fun when you first purchase it.  However it has been years and I have completed the game, defeated the last boss (and his event) and aquired every last drop from it. This game has one thing similar to Minecraft. They both get boring after a while. But terraria stays fun for longer than minecraft. However every now and then, I come back to this game and I enjoy it for a while. I like the gameplay and the graphics. Overall it is a very good game.
6905	0	a	this game sucks
6906	0	a	I play on Windows 10 and the game doesn't play. I click play and the game loads and I can highlight over the buttons on the menu but when I click on them nothing happens. This game sucks... Just a waste of my time and money
6907	0	a	IT WONT LET ME GO FULL SREEN WITHOUT DOWNLOADING SOME RANDOM CRAP! IT SUCKS
6908	0	a	Dont buy The same game on IOS or ANDRIOD is for less money and it kinda sucks
6909	0	a	If you liked Minecraft, then get ready for the action packed slammerino that is Terraria.
6910	0	a	The game is ok I guess, Not really my type 6/10
6911	0	a	This game is crap. Seriously lackluster with stupid game mechanics that go against logic. 0/10 waste of time.
6912	0	a	Flat out the game doesn't work. You can't even use the menu on the current OSX on Mac.
6913	0	a	Can't find Herobrine
6914	0	a	Its a great game, I have lots of time in it and loads of achievements and it's lots of fun with friends. I logged on to steam today and went onto terraria and it had eaten up all my saves! Really terraria? REALLY?
6915	0	a	The game was all fine and dandy until the 1.3.3 update rolled out. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the devs for breaking it cause the game keeps crashing on me 5 or so times per sessions and every time, I'd lose a ton of resources cause this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game doesn't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing save often enough. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
6916	0	a	*I edited the review to remove the snark.  I accept that this is a popular game, but I personally couldn't get into it. The 2d presentation and combat came across as overly simplistic. I found the constant bombardment of hostile monsters to be an annoyance, even though I didn't have any trouble killing them.  Lastly, there wasn't enough explanation as to what I was supposed to do. For example, you've built a 2d house with a tiles to the left, right, and above you. If nothing is walking behind you and you can't move off that single 2d plane, then how would you intuitively know that the house requires a background wall? Especially since monsters can still spawn if the background wall is 'natural' as opposed to placed there by you?  The guide is a joke. His tips are useless and he actually got me killed by opening my door and leaving it open at night, hiding behind me while the monsters that followed him into my house beat me to a pulp. Getting killed by the dude that was supposed to be helping me adjust to the world is what caused me to drop the game.  Just not for me.

6924	0	a	Terraria, in my opinion, is not a good game. It may be great for someone younger than me, but not for me. If you are someone that's around 7, I must first say, you're reading the reviews? I don't even do that half the time! and secondly, this game is perfect for you, but if you are 11 or above, I doubt you will like this game.
6925	0	a	since when was minecraft on steam?? Anyway to transfer my saved worlds over?
6926	0	a	Terraria, a 2d platformer game trying to be a 2d sandbox:   I have been contemplating back and forth reviewing this game let alone whether to give it a good review or not. Recently I came to a decision and as long as steam doesnt censor my review, I'll state why, through much debate, I cannot recommend this game until certain of the games grossly flawed mechanics actually get worked on and fixed. I feel that the pros of this game are quite obvious (i.e Loads of weapons,crafting items, building blocks to collect, Tons of mobs to encounter and bosses to defeat and high performance) I'll focus more on why I reluctantly cant recommend this game   My experience with this game started off quite well, although quite oddly. I'll leave some flawed mechanics out such as the 60 second health potion cooldown and no lock-on for gun weapons, and instead focus on the two most atrocious ones.   The first is the fact that this game has no mob system or spawn conditions for the mobs you encounter which you only see in 2d platfromers. This means you can get overwhelmed by atleast 15-20 mobs! This is only made worse if your character is new. Unfortunately this means if you have an idea to build a super awesome castle base you constantly get interupted by pesky mobs that attack you. Building is a stable of any great sandbox, constantly fighting mobs is a stable of platformers so what is the Dev team trying to market Terraria as???? The evening hours are when more scary mobs come out to play and since for some reason who cant sleep/ skip through the night you'll end up stopping what your building/ working on and just fight mobs the whole night. Adding to distracting mobs, this game is sprinkled with COMPLETELY RANDOM invasion events such as the Blood Moon, Goblin Invasion, Pirate Invasion and Alien Invasion forcibly stopping whatever you happen to be working on and if you dont have a invasion arena setup.......well good luck getting through it without losing massive amounts on money. The Goblin and Pirate Invasion's get a free pass for me for the first encounter since The Pirate and Goblin NPC'S will move into your town. However encounters after the first one shouldnt be completely random. The lack of a mob system also plays into my next problem. Hardmode spread.  Once Hardmode has been activated a new corruption/crimson patch will spawn in your world ans spread ridiculously fast and so will your one and only Hallow biome. So if you havent defeated a mechanical boss or, god forbid, simply lack the skill to kill one or lack the powerful weapons that you ONLY GET IN EXPERT MODE you cant buy the Clemtaminator from the Steampunker. Im not even going to mention the fact that the Clemtaminator is an awful and almost useless tool. Unfortunately my first world was COMPLETELY OVERRUN by Corruption and Hallow. Even starting a new world and following EVERY WORD of the turtorials on containing the spread the Hallow was still able to spread past a 4 GAP HELLIVATOR WITH A WALL OF GRAY BRICK RUNNING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE UNDERWORLD and this unfortunately has overtaken my underground jungle which every world needs. I should ask what to do on the forums what I might have done wrong but if I did everything right and the Hardmode spread is just broken then it needs to be fixed.   This game has so much potential to be even better than it is and I desperately wanted to give this game a thumbs up which I probably will once this game gets a DECENT update, not colored restone wire, not birthday parties and not dust/snowstorms. Right now I simply cant give this game a thumbs up.

6930	0	a	The single most boring game I've ever â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing played during my existence on planet earth. I spawned in and started making a house, my friend destroyed it. We walked out into the boring desert, died but got some cacti. We went the other way in search for a cave, died 4 times. Got trapped in a hole and killed 50+ soul eaters or whatever they're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing called. After that, I walked outside and 78 mil more came at me from nowhere. Died. Alt f4. Devs, go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourselves.
6931	0	a	I'm writting this because I'm waaaay â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off.  The game is fine, but be prepared to lose your WHOLE WORLD and progress in the moment your internet connection decide to fail. The backups DON'T WORK AT ALL, it gets corrupted as f**k and the map gets all glitched. I literally worked hard to the point I was tired as hell building some tunnels and towers and the world was simply gone as soon as the internet came back.   I repeat: The game is ok, but it's not stable at all, you WILL lose your progress and you and your friends WILL regret wasting your time on this piece of garbage.
6932	0	a	This Game is pretty good it has tons of bosses, Unique Weapons, a few nice dungeons and a bunch of pets and other cosmetics. The games soundtrack makes me insta nut but other than that this game is a masterpiece. The only thing its missing is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CATGIRLS WITH HUGE GUN AND BIG SWORD I DEMAND THEY ADD THIS OR ILL REFUND EVEN THOUGH I OWNED FOR M4325 YEARSâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU RELOGIC BRINGE ME WHAT I LOVE I WONT STAND FOR YOU MONEYGRABBING JEWS TO NOT HAVE THIS THIS MY LAST TIKME BEFOR I GO AND FAP TO MY GAY SCAT PORN FETISH.
6933	0	a	I don't like games that make me look up wiki and tutorials online, tutorial should be included in the game, otherwise I don't find it immersive, and that makes it not fun. When did developers start getting lazy and expect fans/streamers to do the work for them? That didn't used to be a thing in games.
6934	0	a	Everyone thought this game could run on a potato, but apparently not. I used to be able to play this game, but since some update, it runs in slow-motion and I can't do anything about it. Now I bassicly can't play. And I've seen people with really beefy PC's and they have the same problem. Please fix it!!
6935	0	a	Meh couldn't get into this.
6936	0	a	Before I start let me say something: I really enjoy this game, but I have reasons for my review. There is a lot to enjoy about terraria, a wide variety of mobs and bosses, plenty of biomes, and an awesome soundtrack. I have played this for around 100 hours, and I still feel like there is still a lot more to see. But even though I can say I have enjoyed playing this game, I can't say I recomend it for one big reason:  One bug This may not sound too bad at first glance, as there are tons of games that end up as glitchy messes, but this bug can ruin the fun of the game. The bug resulted in my loosing my character (Which I had played on for 95 hours), and all the items in its inventory. I have barely even touched the game since then, I don't want to end up breaking things even more. So with that I had lost 95 hours, which I had done so much. What's worce is that this bug has been around for over a year! I would expect that a team behind a game as popular as this would have found some solution already, but all I've seen are the rather un-helpful responce 'You should've kept a backup', which would be better to say to a person before something happens instead of afterwards.  So until I see this bug fixed, or something that would ease the loss, I cannot say that I recommend this game.
6937	0	a	There is a Problem with Opening game it does not work ;/
6938	0	a	Very boring. Widescreen users DO NOT BUY THIS. The Ui is super small for more than 1900x900. Also since the UI is pretty small you cant see anything! Waste of money 
6939	0	a	what are you doing here buy it                  2d minecraft better 
6940	0	a	The Steam multiplayer integration is a joke. Can't play for more than 5 minutes before it desyncs and fails to register a connection, no matter what PC you use.
6941	0	a	It gets really boring after awile
6942	0	a	Starting the review off my saying I definately got my money's worth out of this game and overall really enjoyed playing it. I would still recommend it to someone who has never played it.  But...  I reinstalled it and after several updates they kind of butchered it IMO. It's extremely zoomed out now so it hurts me eyes, and the game got weirdly 'floaty' is the best way I can describe it. I highly doubt it's in my head, falling seemed WAY slower then before and just general movement all felt very sluggish.  I REALLY doubt it's my computer.
6943	0	a	Look its a great game, but the community is just full of weeaboo's.
6944	0	a	It's okay. Starbound is better IMO. Too many things were left unfinished and limited.
6945	0	a	I let my kid play this and now he won't talk to me.
6946	0	a	  it super slow motion and lagy and sas runs all computres 
6947	0	a	I am an old man. There was a time when this was the only kind of game we had. There was cholera and polio too back then.  The 5 minutes I lost was far more valuable than the $5.

6951	0	a	will not download, i even uninstalled steam and tried again but it still wont download, it goes to 99% then restarts
6952	0	a	it dosent work for windows 10 :[ :[ plz fix
6953	0	a	i don't recommend this game because its rubish
6954	0	a	Everyone loves this game, but I couldn't get into it. If a game doesn't engage me within the first hour, I'm out. I'd rather play Minecraft.
6955	0	a	Too small, too difficult to play. I like complex games, but too much was crammed in. Nothing is explained to the player so you're left trying to figure out how to craft and get better equippment on your own. Simply a miss-managed game that got lost in itself. If you want to spend hours hunched over squinting at a 2D 8-bit sidecroller survival game for hours on end, trying to see what the hell you're doing, then this actually may be for you.
6956	0	a	After playing for about two-three hours, I realized this game wasn't for me.
6957	0	a	I love this game in all honestly. The biomes, enemies, items, etc. I only have a few hours into the game and I have spent 8 hours into a character. But what do i get? A blank character slot. I have tried everything to restore my character. I gave up on that and started from scratch. Atleast 2 hours on that character, boom disappeared. It seems like many don't have this problem but few people can't enjoy this amazing game without something like disappearing characters. Redigit all im asking for you is to fix this bug. Everything has it going for this game. It's just that one little bug that makes it for hard for some people to play the game.   This game is a 9/10 without this bug 7/10 with the bug  But hey you are most likely not to get this bug. -Eggo
6958	0	a	this game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ an is not better then the division 
6959	0	a	Im a big Terraria fan, I have it on my mobile device, and I have it on console, I recently bought the PC version to play 1.3, but terraria seems to open up off screen making it impossible to play the game, only sit there and listen to the title screen music, like that will help
6960	0	a	Bought this game specificaly to play witha friend, cant even do that because steam servers are garbage. 10/10 would disconnect again
6961	0	a	I don't have the required hours to give this game a positive review
6962	0	a	Uhhhh. Am I missing something? I downloaded this game and the controls seemed to be very awkward. I would up having to reconfig everything while creatures were attacking. Not only that, it would sometimes catch on the cycle item left/right for items, making it so I could get to an axe in time. And I couldn't seem to chop down trees.
6963	0	a	SO I HAVE 90+ HOURS IN THIS GAME, and I decided to take brake from the game. When I re-installed (on the same pc) I couldnt play the game fullscreen and the resolution was totally crap. Really dissapointed (I am using Lenovo Y70 Touch)
6964	0	a	I could recommend this game to people.... But I tried refunding it and Valve stole my money.
6965	0	a	ok so i'm saying no because i had the solar eruption (a weapon) i used it i died lost checked where i died counldn't find it gone well there goes one of my best weapons unless Duke Fishron stole it then i don't know maybe bugged but that is just bad
6966	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6967	0	a	I played for more than one hundred of hours on a map. I saved it to the cloud and it disappear. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you sincerely.
6968	0	a	 1 Part I Liked  You can build a castle floating in the clouds. Or a shack deep in the jungle. Or a pirate ship. The world(s) are yours to mold.   1 Part I Disliked  Most of the progression is based on random factors: finding where the world has generated that vein of ore you're looking for, grinding bosses to get the drops you want, hoping this dungeon chest has the right type of loot, etc.
6969	0	a	PC crashed and lost a world that I spent hours on...â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Besides this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, its a great game 4/10 lost worlds
6970	0	a	PC crashed and lost a world that I spent hours on...â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Besides this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, its a great game 4/10 lost worlds
6971	0	a	I hate this game. My brother, for whom I bought this game, hates this game. There is no way to learn the controls, what you are supposed to do or how to do it. Other than by dying a bijillion times. But the big problem is, I cant survive longer than 10 seconds to actually figure any thing out. Which is highly frustrating. No, extrememly frustrating. Im glad at least I only wasted $2 on this game.
6972	0	a	  my terraria is not opening up and that is making me made
6973	0	a	terraria won't let me put stuff back when I want to 
6974	0	a	I played for more than one hundred of hours on a map. I saved it to the cloud and it disappear. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you sincerely.
6975	0	a	Don't trust David ever again. Is bad game.
6976	0	a	I'd rather staple my left testicle to a bear's paw and watch it try to slap it off while I furiously masturbate with a cheese grater than play this for another 12 seconds.
6977	0	a	really complicated, hard to get in to, not that much fun
6978	0	a	its sucks it dosent work â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for me you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es
6979	0	a	Game keeps freezin. starts of laggin then it freezes. tried sloutions on youtube but didnt work.have to close switch for PC. Its a nice game but crashes and freezes and lags
6980	0	a	I regret what i had previously said. This game has tricked me more times than i bother to remember. I start a new world and as soon as i'm about to fight the wall it crashes! Really! A ll my efforts wasted! The backup's don't ever work and they always fail. Everytime i think it will not crash it does. Watch your purchases because this game is a TIME WASTER!!!!
6981	0	a	Boring after a while. buy starbound instead! it has much more to explore
6982	0	a	this game succs
6983	0	a	I had to buy it again because I went to controls and I made the inventory key left click but then whenever I want to swing my blade it goes to inventory instead and when I want save and exit it goes to inventory so I have to lose my progress when I log back on and I have to shut my computer down to get out of the game
6984	0	a	it has a bit of glitches
6985	0	a	terraria won't let me put stuff back when I want to 
6986	0	a	  it sucks i bought a 4 pack and now i cant play my friends cant and i cant
6987	0	a	Im trying for 2 years now to start the game but its simply not starting...
6988	0	a	Fight me.

6992	0	a	Im trying for 2 years now to start the game but its simply not starting...
6993	0	a	Fight me.
6994	0	a	This game is literally Modded Minecraft, minus a third very needed dimension, making things extremely cramped and finicky to work with. I can't imagine why people would prefer this over something like Technic modded Minecraft. The graphics are very pixelized, which to some people might seem quaint but personally I just think that's the kind of art style that only survives because of people who grew up with it and feel nostalgic over it, because to someone who didn't dear god someone please pass the eye bleach. I refunded this within the hour.

6998	0	a	it has a bit of glitches
6999	0	a	I personally just couldn't get into this game. as a sidescrollers where you build things, go off and get equipment/materials to build with. It just seems boring. Unfortuately I played minecraft before this I felt they were simalar, but I don't play it either anymore. This game defenitely put more work into the combat system.
7000	0	a	Great, except it crashes whenever i try to change the resolution to anything but the auto setting, I dont want to play a game where i cant read anything.
7001	0	a	Got bored straight away
7002	0	a	this game is garbage, no replay value and very short game
7003	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7004	0	a	Within 6 days of downloading this game, I've had to delete two worlds. I would save and exit the world as normal, but when I'd try to reload it later, it would fail. I would then try to load the backup, but my game would crash. Each world had several hours of work. I don't know if this is a problem with the game or my computer, but if it's the game, it's an issue that seriously needs to be fixed.
7005	0	a	I played this for 60 hours just because 2 of my friends liked it. I was miserable for the whole time.
7006	0	a	For years I have tried to like this, since I was a fan of Minecraft and stuff. I always put it down within half an hour or so. The building aspect is really shallow and it doesn't benefit very much from the multiplayer aspect. I think it just isn't very interesting unless you are really into platform games.
7007	0	a	This game is fantastic...except for one minor problem. The new update has changed the way you set down blocks. making it easier to form a house or any other square object. But anything from a wall to a tardis console is now near impossible due to you not being allowed to put the blocks except where the game wants you to. This took a lot of the fun of the game, and ruins the idea of a sandbox doesnt it?
7008	0	a	Why are you in the negatives? look at the numbers mate over 100 thousand to 5 thousand.  Slight downsides of the game: RNG, Glitches, Terrible sense of instruction form the game devs Upsides: Everything else
7009	0	a	I found the entire interface so incredibly frustrating as to the point where I almost quit because it was so difficult to use, However I persevered and evevntally dug a mineshaft which fell into a cave. After exploring said cave, I though 'hmm, I'll just leave this cave now' but try as I might, I couldn't work out how I could possibly place the blocks in the right place to do that. However I managed to drop some sand which flung me in th right direction and allowed me to escape.  I was pretty ragey at this point, but when I got stuck on the wrong side of a pond which obviously I shouldn't be able swim out of, because that doesn't make sense, right? I know a some people who really enojy this game, but pretty much from the very begining, I hated almost everything about this game.
7010	0	a	My friends play this and I really want to play it but, as soon as I press anything it goes back to the menu screen. This means I can't play the game and it was a complete waste of money
7011	0	a	The game's interface is too small to read. There is STILL no option to resize it ingame even after five years of game development.
7012	0	a	It doesn't work anymore
7013	0	a	The game is great, just don't bye it if you have a MAC. 1.3.4.4 wont work.

7074	0	a	This game takes so much time to get good stuff. And you need to watch so much youtube videos to know what your doing. I hate this game. To complex. Horrible game. WANT A REFUND!
7075	0	a	game is boring. and i can't refound a â™¥â™¥â™¥ key . . .
7076	0	a	Terraria seemed to be a fun game, but crashed when I chopped 2 trees. Tried this with any character and world size. Do not buy until they make a hotfix.
7077	0	a	It sux
7078	0	a	you cant actually do anything the screenshots show.
7079	0	a	Bad ripoff of minecraft
7080	0	a	It is a good game, when they add splitscreen coop like in the console versions i will truly recomend it enough of this 'no splitscreen on pc' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.  And for those that think 'You would need an extra keyboard and mouse to play', Terraria supports gamepads since 1.3.1, there are dozens of couch coop games on pc (Helldivers, Gauntlet, Serious Sam 3, Dungeon Defenders; List of some others:  http://co-optim.us/1aVPX80)   Any PC can have several gamepads connected like any console (Have 4 Wireless Xbox360 connected without a problem). And can also connect it to a TV with a single damn HDMI cable.  So no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing excluses here seriously, don't even try, the devs just don't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about porting the feature because people still think it is god damn impossible to do it on PC (even if we have several examples of games with this feature)
7081	0	a	This game is now part of my WNP category. Will Never Play.
7082	0	a	Doesn't work. Loads then crashes. I think it has something to do with my 1600 by 900 screen resolution, but i'm not sure.
7083	0	a	its not that good
7084	0	a	Umm this is my favorite game so far, I will most likely be playng this non stop for the whole summer. I really like all the different mosters and ore, I llove all the different weapons and ites to collect in the game. They have a great amount of items to decorate your house and character, also not gonna lie the character customization for this game destroys fallout 4. Only thing I wish their was more of is tables so I can be seen as a great terraria player! I'd also like to thank the developers as this is the only quality game on steam so far.
7085	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible 2d peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ abortion. !!!{DO NOT BUY}!!!

7101	0	a	What the other reviews don't tell you is that when you die you have to stare at 'YOU DIED' for 15 seconds before you can respawn, every single time, and there's no way to change that.
7102	0	a	  I haven't played this game for that long and i got this game for free from some online kid who was nice. This game was fun when playing with a friend, but it wasn't that addicting to play. I like minecraft more but thats just me. I know many people love this game. I am not hating on it, I just wasn't hooked on it.
7103	0	a	This game needs an update now!
7104	0	a	  I find it kinda boring because it's too complicated and it's not really that fun grinding to figure the game out
7105	0	a	It looks like a nice game, but it just would not open for me.
7106	0	a	Yeah, look I really can't recommend this game if you're trying to go for really enjoying the game I played this game, I played it alot with my friend, we played it for hours and hours. We farmed and grinded for bosses, we did every possible thing you could do in the game, then when we ran out of things to do you know what we did? Wait for the big â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing update, 1.3  We waited a good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing year for that update, we had literally nothing else to do while we waited, so we just sat on our â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing chairs and stared at our computers just waiting for that update to come.  You know what it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing did when it came? Absolutely jack â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it made the game less playable, it added more grinding and farming, the devs did anything but listen to the community, for a newcomer that update could be seen as good, but it limited what the players already had and just made it all in all, boring. My friend and I just loaded up the game when 1.3 came out, absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hysterical about this whole thing, we played for a while to see that nothing had â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing changed, it was just the same old terraria with like, a few new decoration blocks  If you plan on buying this game, go ahead, you'll like it. Its a good game, but 1.3 was a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing disaster that should take no place in the history of Terraria. I stopped playing this game after 1.3 and I am now looking at starbound to be the next big whatever.  Game before update 7/10 Game after update 5/10 (Moonlord is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t and you need to farm for hours on end to get a single chance at that overpowered piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥)  EDIT: Fixed words and words fixed

7135	0	a	this game is a fun game (for 15 days) but then it becomes horrible and this is a game that doesent have any fun in it  it becomes a blank slate after a while so dont get this game its not that great anyways but if you are rich then you should be able to have it to play when you get way to bored
7136	0	a	I'm not hating. i just want you to view.      Terraria: Otherworld, it's wierd. no like i mean its just. they changed the textures and skins and stuff and. terraria the old one was good. and it's just. they'res atleast a 6.5% chance that terraria (not otherworld) will get updated anymore. its sad
7137	0	a	Boring, like a minecraft without any technology/automation mods.

7144	0	a	Played for about 20 minutes with no indication of what I was supposed to do. I killed some monsters I collected some things but everytime I went to settings to figure out the controls and tweak the game I would die because the game kept going. This is not dark souls its ok to pause when I go to a menu. Gonna see if i can get a refund as its kinda lame.

7146	0	a	  this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks
7147	0	a	  A single game takes ages to generate, the character customization is abysmal, the gameplay is boring, and the building aspect is terribly limited by the 2D mechanics.  Lame game, couldn;t even get into it without falling asleep.

7155	0	a	I dont care how good this game is (i know its good, im not here for that) i really was looking forward playing this game. so i start it up. i heard they have Xbox version, so i assumed they cant be so stupid to not include controller support.  they were that stupid.   where the f..k is the controller support?! you already f....ing have it! why isnt it in the PC version?!  i cant comment on how the game plays, because this little thing ruined it for me.  probabyl noone gonna read this but f u devs for this.
7156	0	a	This game is CRAP, compared to starbound. Get Starbound insted, its way better.
7157	0	a	this is a good game but if you have windows 10 its another thing it may work for most windows 10 players but for other windows 10 players it dosen't work and they woln't fix it iv'e asked but they woln't fix it. id suggest you not buy this game intill future notice
7158	0	a	nope don't like it whatsever. Great for stealing peoples doors though
7159	0	a	A common praise for this game is that is has more 'game' than Minecraft. That if you felt Minecraft lacked 'gameplay' than Terraria is a 2D answer to your problems.  I suppose it is that. But what about this represents more 'gameplay' is beyond me. The amount of button pressing is similar. The flexibility of the building system is greatly diminished. The crafting system is blissfully more transparent and hellishly more bloated feeling. The combat is tedious and as best I can tell the added 'gameplay' is simply more grind. Mining takes more grind, crafting takes more grind, combat takes more grind.  I found it somewhat enjoyable but mostly I found it compulsive in the way grind-filled games tend to be. It lacks the heart, charm, flexibility and stark gandeur of Minecraft. By my reckoning, Minecraft is Terraria with more 'game.' Minecraft has a host of problems, of course, from its tedious dependence on using a wiki to the obscurity and pointlessness of many of its systems such as enchantment. But Terraria has all these problems, too.   Clearly, I don't understand this particular common refrain about Terraria and additionally while I do think it has a compulsive coherence I found myself feeling like I was perpetuatlly waiting for the REAL game to start. I think you probably already know if that's ok with you, but on the off chance that you don't know ... stay away. There are much more worthy games if you're experimenting with the unknown.
7160	0	a	This game gave me cancer.

7162	0	a	Is boring without friends, still boring with friends. There are better bullet hells out there.
7163	0	a	Pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in gay not gonna lie. Minecraft greatly improves the gameplay shown in this game so go buy that you nerds     Also, Heracross is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pokemon     Edit: Because some people are taking this seriously, I would like to point out this is a joke. Please use your brain. No one is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

7171	0	a	This game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Immediatly, after the first save, has broken every world for no reason. I have no mods and did nothing wrong. Developers of this game should â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hang themselves for wasting my time, and creating a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ unfinished piece of trash that is basically unplayable. I want my money back honestly.

7191	0	a	Terraria used to be a lovable little indie game starring cartoony characters, simple graphics, Lovecraftian bosses, and a little bit of everything to explore, slay, build, and craft.  Now, it's filled to the brim with edgy mages, OP bosses, enemies, and weapons, a boring, irrelevant 'plotline' that was just recently devised, and much, much more.  Issues aside, it's still got the fun and excitement of adventure and exploration left in it. But just hear me out on this one:   change isn't always good.  
7192	0	a	It was alright.
7193	0	a	Well I enjoyed it alot. About 4 years ago.  It was easy then. Build. Jam to the awesome chiptune soundtrack. Mine. Fight the Wall of Flesh. Beat all the bosses. Grab the Excalibur. Done.  They rammed in so many weapons that my inventory is constantly filled, and oh dear lord all of the particle effects. It litterally gets you to a point in the game where everything you own is overpowered, one shotting poor little rabbits and basic monsters, and nothing a a challenge anymore. The litterally decided to use Chrismas Tree and mulitple freaking Yo-Yos as weapons in the game.New order.  Build. Mine. Jam to still epic chiptune music. Beat the Wall of Flesh. Grab the Excalibur. Just kidding, apparently that was the fake one. Now use your fake Excalibur to craft the TRUE excalibur. Grab the Night's Edge. Oh wait sorry then the True Night's Edge. Then use the TRUE Excalibur and the TRUE Night's Edge. To Craft lo and behold, the Terrablade. Defeat the Moon Lord. Wallow in self pity on the false sense of accomplishment. Done.  The game takes almost no skilll, just a lot of time. A lot of time wasted.
7194	0	a	It was alright.
7195	0	a	It's a great game!
7196	0	a	Terraria is an awesome game. It is very fun, and there are loads of stuff to do.  That said, I cannot recommend this game because it is simply too hard.   From the beginning: You start off in a forest-like area, and you must build a shelter because at night enemies will spawn and attack you (Like Minecraft) Eventually you will learn to master the world, and NPCs will move to your town, who provide valuable goods and services.  Once you get enough equipment, you fight a boss. The boss then opens up a new boss fight, and so forth. Between the first boss fight (Eye of Cthulu) and the fourth boss (Wall of Flesh) is probably one of the most fun experiences I've had in a video game. However, after you beat the Wall of Flesh (which is a BS boss fight) your world enters 'Hardmode' which means that the difficulty is taken to absurd new heights. After some time, you will have stronger gear and be able to defeat normal enemies with ease, and now you are ready to fight one of the three initial Hardmode bosses.  This is where things get ugly. This is the game's fatal flaw: the boss fights. They are a major part of Terraria and very crucial to game advancement. They are also impossible to kill alone.  Your first choice: The Destroyer. This is a giant worm, and probably the easiest of the Hardmode bosses (relatively) BUT IT IS STILL A LOAD OF BS. I had the strongest equipment possible before killing the boss, but it wasn't enough. You can't beat this game with skill, because the bosses are spongy and move around too much to be able to effectively attack them. Did I mention you only have about ~10 minutes to beat any of the 3 Hardmode bosses? Also BS: consider there is a cooldown of ONE MINUTE between healing potions (though there is an item that takes it down to 45 seconds) and the best healing potion possible can only heal 150 points of maximum 500 health.  Choice #2: The Twins. A pair of giant eyeballs that fly around in a choppy and abrupt manner, making them hard to hit with any sort of weapon (especially melee) Also: they shoot lasers and green fire at you. The best part: once you take one of them down to half health, it transforms, upgrading its attack power AND defense. Must be fought during nighttime and slain before dawn to win. Total BS.  Choice #3: Skeletron Prime. THIS IS THE MOST BS YOU WILL EVER EXPERIENCE. A large floating head with extremely high HP and defense, and arms that a) shoot lasers at you, b) shoot bombs at you, c) slice you with a chainsaw, and d) crush you with a claw. The head also attacks you quite a bit. The arms can be knocked out, but they are even harder to hit than the Twins, since they are smaller and move faster.  Once you beat ALL THREE (note: this is basically impossible alone. You won't have enough firepower, and if you die once, the boss disappears. The boss fights are prohibitively expensive, since the items you need to summon them are hard to get and can only be used once) you can move on to Plantera. I've never even seen Plantera in-game, but I assume the same rules apply that applied to the first three bosses. Not to mention that the thing that summons Plantera spawns randomly underground in the Jungle, which means you could be searching for a while just to ATTEMPT to fight the boss, and you could potentially be knocked out lightning fast.  tl;dr The game is very fun up until hardmode. Afterwards the game becomes a BSfest and grindfest that is impossible to finish unless you have friends. (I don't...) 
7197	0	a	Guess I am one of the odd ones who dislikes this game. I don't understand the hype at all. Chop and build things. Meh. Rather spend my time in ableton. So I get it why some like this game. Its fun to be creative, but for me its not my enjoyment of creation. Give me a Virus ti2 and some brake beats.
7198	0	a	This game is a game ment to take up as much time of your day if you love gaming with friends finding new treasure then this is the game for you but if you like a meaning to a game then done buy it hahaha 10/10 fun 5/10 has magic 3/10 alot of gore unless switched off
7199	0	a	I cant understand why ppl like this game either I thgouht its a 2nd person shooter game like gun monkeys or something that looking like a puzzel game but that even worsse..  Dunno even why I spent my money for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥..
7200	0	a	the 1.3.3 update sucks balls its does not affect end game players and we waited a while for this update and still cant do anything but make a new character like i know thats what you do when u beat game but ive already played all of the roles and have nothing else to do why u do this to us at least they should have made the new weapons and armor more for end game than mid game and maybe a new boss at least it would get people some reason to get on and progress.   the 1.3.4 update sucks balls its does not affect end game players also to even start the event you need to find the cancerous npc and he is a pain to find, the best update in my opinion is 1.3 they added moon lord and the celestial event and the lunitic cultist and more end game items so people could progress and actually play the game. Dont get me wrong they did add new weapons and armor and more items it's just that all of it is for later hardmode and not end game as previously stated i said that 1.3 was my favorite update cause of the addition towards end game and it made people want to progress further and yes i do understand for all of the people who are not at the end game think that this update is great which is good for you people im just say it would have nice to get new end game items and a end game boss/event.
7201	0	a	  this game is for gays
7202	0	a	Edit: (New Review because i compared it too much to minecraft) Basically Terraia is really nothing more than a grindfest in about everything involved with it, Mining, fighting, etc.: grindfests. Due to this and the low replay value, the game gets boring fast when all the content is discovered through endless grinding of course, which is probably the reason why the developers decided to add in all the conetnt in it in the first place because its as if they knew it would be the game's only backbone, as evident from the fanbase when they use this trait as their main argument of the game being worthwhile. On other notes the 2d nostalgia-dependent graphics harms the games buidling aspect as you are limited to a side view which gets quite annoying, as for the combat which is heralded as the game's main selling point against minecraft *drumroll*...... is basically just like minecrafts combat system, they both require spamming the attack button to defeat enemies which is again. boring. the only difference really is the gunz and majuks but you still have to spam. But to sum it up its basically zelda/final fantasy turned into a sandbox, which explains why it would have never appealed to me in a artistic sense. I can see where people would like the game if they had enough tolerance but definitley not me
7203	0	a	THIS IS GOD DAMN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T EVERY TIME I TRY TO MAKE A NEW WORLD IT CRASHES â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU AND YOUR GAME WASTE OF MY MONEY
7204	0	a	This is grinding the game.
7205	0	a	I bought this a long time ago, and only after i bought it did i realize it only worked on windows. recently, i discovered i could play it.    0/10 would not buy again
7206	0	a	This game is for 4 year olds, hence the reason my brother has over 900 hours logged. 2/10 would not recommend to you or your younger siblings.
7207	0	a	I'm a big fan of minecraft, so I was excited to play this game. But I found that it was fiddly, uninteresting, difficult to understand, and ultimately not fun. Also, the endless blobs are really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing annoying,
7208	0	a	Tedious
7209	0	a	I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate when the game stops and I lose all i did that save
7210	0	a	DONT GET IT IT IS THE WORST GAME EVER AN THIS IS A COPY OF MINECRAFT BUT THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT IT IS THERE IS MORE ITEMS IN IT
7211	0	a	I cant even play it. I download it and run it and steam says im in game, but im not. i go to task manager and its running alright, just in 'background procceses' instead of 'applications'. i have this on mobile, but character creation doesnt work when i get up to the the make a character name part. then only two keys work: the letter 'I' and the letter 'R' so i can't even hit enter to create the character.
7212	0	a	I might be the only guy that thinks this is boring. 4/10
7213	0	a	Screw this game. Don't waste your money. Block placement has no ryme or reason, it places blocks in columns of usuall 4 blocks wide, removing the ability to esil make anything. hen to want to attack something, you have to turn around so your sword hits in that direction, meaning that you can't keep hitting and retreating. This game is just a waste of your money and time.
7214	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game i want a refund xD 
7215	0	a	Company Of Terraria Please tell me why all my hard work is gone If i get my stuff back i will be happy i played this game for along time for that crap i want my stuff back  PS IF THIS IS A BUG I STILL WANT MY STUFF BACK PPS  I am serious :(
7216	0	a	I saw the advertising video and I was pretty sure I was buying 1.3, buut I actually bought 1.0
7217	0	a	Too many bugs, the game 'pauses' every 10 seconds, but during the pause the ennemies still kill you. Also, too much fight from the very beginning. In the end, I got bored after 30 min of game.
7218	0	a	(Read the whole review) Don't buy this game its a waste of money, it gets repetitive and you will most likely going to go to a item server to get items. Then the game gets boring. And you get these MAGICAL weapons so cool. If you like minecraft give it a try but if you are into games like Grand Theft Auto or CS:GO or Team Fortress 2, you will not like this game one bit. If you also like arcade graphics and/or have a bad pc you will definitely like this. But im a FPS and GTA 5 Player so this game doesnt appeal to me at all. And for anyone wondering its usually the 22nd most played game on steam.
7219	0	a	THIS GAME SUCK IT IS SO BAD THAT I WOULD RATHER PLAY LEAUGE OF LEGENDS INSTEAD. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME, IM GONNA PLY SOME CS GO OR BLACK OPS 3 BYE (from duh swede)

7229	0	a	Everytime I play this stupid game it crashes so I can't even run it.
7230	0	a	I cant play
7231	0	a	Ok, so first off, I bought this game a long time ago. Then a couple months ago I played it and there were so many new things introduced, like Telelporter, rainbow torches, and a Xenostaff??? Anyways, they've made a massive change, mostly for the good of the game. (Was kind of getting boring... :P) However after you installed the update and started playing with your friends with the new 'Join via Steam' option, you'd realise how much stuff you could get. My buds and I were like 'Woah dude that sick! Yeah man, lets craft everything in the game... &lt;Not really. We thought we were going to have the time of our lives, playing a crafting/survival game together, crafting tons of items... Then after about of month of playing, I realised that we weren't going anywhere quickly,we thought that because we defeated the Wall of Flesh, that we were unstoppable with all of the items that we recieved from the goodie bags. We thought that until the Pirate invasion came, that really hit us hard. We eventually got through it and we kept going through the game. A couple days later my Youth minister came, he was wearing sick as armour and had awesome gear, we thought he had like finished the game! But then a couple days ago he said that the gear that he had was useless junk considering who he was up against. Thats when it hit me, bro, this game at least is gonna take about a year and a half to finish, and I have a life to live for a reason. And so that is when I bought ARK: Survival Evolved and that was good, but repeptative... Anyways, there are a lot more other games to play which are better than this, don't waste your money and your life on this. Buy Dota 2, its a fun game that only lasts for about 40mins a match...  Only get Terraria if you don't want a life...   
7232	0	a	Just bought this game and for some reason it won't even start, half of the time I have no error codes. Oh well wish I could have a refund.
7233	0	a	This game is just not fun 
7234	0	a	'The only ores which will always spawn naturally in any given world are Meteorite, Obsidian, Hellstone, and Chlorophyte. All other ores are paired off so that only one out of each pair will spawn in a world. For pre-hardmode ores, this is determined at world generation; for hardmode ores, this is determined when the first, second, and third Demon Altar or Crimson Altar is destroyed. Within each pair, each member has an equal chance of spawning. Which ores are paired together are shown to the right. Only one of the hard mode ores will spawn, so multiple worlds might be necessary to get a certain ore(Adamantite for Suspicious Looking Skulls).  In all cases, equipment made from replacement ores will be statistically slightly stronger than equivalent equipment made from the original ore.' - Taken from  terraria.wikia.com   I really liked this game up until the devs did this. Basically, the new ore types they introduced to the game weren't simply added to the word generation, which is what I thought, because that would MAKE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SENSE. Either the original ore will be generated in your world, or the equivalent new ore, but never both. You can have copper or tin, but not both. You can have Adamantite or Titanium, but not both. A lot of items can be crafted by either equivalent ore types, but the items crafted out of the newly added ore types will -always- be better somehow. Even if they're statistically identical, the items made out of the new ore types will still sell for more. Basically in order to craft the best items in the game you'll probably want to generate multiple worlds just for mining. It's possible to obtain an ore type that didn't spawn in your world by using the extractinator, but who wants to do that? This is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

7239	0	a	this game sucks it doesint let me PLAY ITS CRAP 
7240	0	a	You'll probably see the 0.1h of playtime, but that is all i needed to see how bad this game is. Bad graphics, awkward controls, nonexistent physics, ripoff of Minecraft, repetitive crashing and any tools you hold are bigger than your player and can go through walls to hit whatever is behind it! Did the developers even try? Basically, what I'm saying is get the game, see if you like it. I didn't like it, but that's me. Get it and try it out.
7241	0	a	Well it is pretty good, but it is harder than ios and xbox games pls make it more easy! 
7242	0	a	Too. Many. Glitches. Excessive crashing and much more.

7245	0	a	Well how would I put it, this game is so repetitive for me, the only good part about this game is multiplayer with friends, but even that gets repetitive pretty quick (atleast for me tho)
7246	0	a	Needs better graphics XD jk I'm just not really into this game genre just have it because a friend gifted it :p
7247	0	a	Yeah dont even bother. Ive had two characters so far who Ive done back breaking work for and have played for 50+ hours on and both of them just disappeared.

7255	0	a	This game is alright for the most part, but it is incredibly buggy and when i tried to configure my options, the game broke on itself because the mobs kept attacking me and it broke the menu. I could not connect to my friends and it was very laggy. I DO NOT recommend this.
7256	0	a	Let me describe my experience playing this.  - Got in . created a character. - Started chopping trees like an ecoterrorist - Got to a cave ...... it was dark, got some torches and explored it - I built a house - Lost interest  For some reason this game disapointed me and made me rush to the uninstall button O.O  This is not a good reason to not buy it , great work you just wasted 1 minute of your life reading this. Maybe ill give it 'another chance' and make a better review but until then.....   Still reading ? 2 min mark now......  In my opinion, its just a failed attempt to make a Side-scroller minecraft-kind game .   I made a mistake buying this (just like i did with state of decay while i could've bought dying light ) so dont do the same   ( 3min mark )   I just failed miserably at making both a review and a joke ...... yay me. Nah just dont buy it...
7257	0	a	Any game that requires a wiki to be open in another window to actually know how to play isn't a good game.
7258	0	a	I like Minecraft better but this game is alright. I'm still not recommending like a bleeting cow though but I will say that most people randomly like it. It's not a positive thing, just a fact. Take it as you will.
7259	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

7267	0	a	this game is very confusing
7268	0	a	Ive played terraria on my iPhone and I loved it! then i played it on my computer and it was very annoying. You have no lighting unless you have torches and the controls are annoying. Also you dont have good range for mining and swinging your sword. It is very hard to install mods also. It was not worth $10.
7269	0	a	Its the new stupid graphics that sucks. remove them

7275	0	a	Not a game I enjoyed, though the charm it holds for those who enjoy it is evident.
7276	0	a	The game can be real good fun but there is a bad issue that causes me to give a bad review. The issue being worlds getting corrupt i spent 10-15 hours on a world and abought to go on hard mode and then i deside i have had enough i save the game and exited and when i went back to play the game was lost. I tryed going back to the save deleating .wld and renaming the .wld.bak file so it was just .wld and it did not work. So for this i have to give a bad review hope the can patch this bug.
7277	0	a	ZERO STARS, zero â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stars. i hate this game soooo â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing much it makes me screem it is way to hard to get started and mobs arre soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing anyoing. not only that but the controlls are jack â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I hate this game and do not recamend it to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    -ps â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME!
7278	0	a	Couldn't get into it for the life of me.  Just feels like 2D Minecraft with more bosses and more weapons.  Not convinced.
7279	0	a	could join any servers and windows is not blocking it...

7285	0	a	SUCKETY SUCKS!!! BOUGHT THIS GAME AND IT WONT EVEN LOAD!!
7286	0	a	I just never found it fun. I have played it before with friends, and even then i found it stupid.
7287	0	a	If two pieces of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ met and had sex then had a baby with birth defects.... that would be this game. 0/10
7288	0	a	CRAP
7289	0	a	this game has the worst graphics not even possible to live a day and it just sucks in general
7290	0	a	Every second I play this game I ask myself why I'm not just playing Minecraft. Minecraft has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics but awesome open world sandbox gameplay. Terraria has even worse graphics and - side scroller gameplay. Most overrated game in the history of overrated games.
7291	0	a	the multiplayer doesnt â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing work!

7294	0	a	This game never â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing saves the characters and world plz change that who ever made this game
7295	0	a	I couldn't even get past 5min of this game without dying every 30 seconds. It's not that I'm lazy and don't want to read wikis but if the learning curve of the game is this difficult I don't even feel motivated to play the game. I spent way too long trying to find a way to get back to the main menu and ended up Alt-F4'ing, only to realise all I had to do was hit Esc and click the word 'Settings' in the lower right hand side of the screen (which I didn't even notice). The preview videos and screenshots made the game look awesomely fun and the idea of a 2D platformer plus minecraftian sandbox intrigued me, but my first impressions of the game just made me extremely frustrated.
7296	0	a	Surprisingly boring.
7297	0	a	This game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks at the beginning. I enjoy the late game but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that start to the game is impossible. So â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing grindy and aweful. Took me about 3 days in real life of grinding on expert mode soft core to beat skeletron. Jesus had a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

7318	0	a	Personally I do not like this game at all. Maybe it was because I played Minecraft before ever playing Terraria. I just can't seem to get into it.
7319	0	a	This being me, i cant really get into minecraft kinds of games, so if u like minecraft u will like this. but for me i couldnt get into it.

7322	0	a	Please realize we are in 2015 !! Stone age pcs can play this in 1980s â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !!! Worthless game even for that money!! Should be free!!!  This is what i call negging marketing!!! Terraria devs paid me for this,so i did!!  Sorry to dissapoint terraria die-hard fans!!  PS: If you like the game cuz of its diversity,then play Anno 2250 or something!!! Spoilers xD!!!
7323	0	a	I loved ths game and found it so addictive then the character i played 25 hours on was lost such a disappointment I loved this game as well
7324	0	a	Game was going great farmed turtles for 3 hours to get 3 turtle shells then when i made the armor poof half the armor was gone waste of time glitchy as hell
7325	0	a	Go on multiplayer Find some guy Wants to be friends I say why In return he starts shooting a meowmere and crashes server........ WHAT  P.S. ALL SERVERS ARE LIKE THIS!!!!!!!! 
7326	0	a	Terraria is a game where if you dont have $26 for minecraft than buy this. Its a little less.
7327	0	a	I personnally do not like this game but it is only because I started off with Minecraft and I enjoy the open word format. But I will say that I hear plenty of good things about Terraria. So lets just leave it at that.
7328	0	a	You were slain... You were slain... You were slain... You were slain...  That's pretty much my experience with Terraria. I'm ragequitting after an hour because it's so damn frustrating to keep dying in the dark and not knowing how to get ahead to the cool parts shown in the trailers. The game doesn't exactly guide you very far. Maybe it would be a better experience with more time but it honestly hasn't pulled me in at all despite how much everyone else seems to love it. So in my frustration I'm leaving a negative review.
7329	0	a	it sucks it wont even load the game and screw up my pc &gt;:(
7330	0	a	Gets boring, no directions, not so good.
7331	0	a	do not get this game its like CRACK mycousin played for 2 days and now he lives in my basement tring to kill king slime
7332	0	a	I just can't understand what i am doing in this game and always die in that frikin cave. If you like grinding things and killing stuff with a tiny man go for it :D
7333	0	a	Ever since auto-swing by holding down the left mouse button for some swords was removed Terraria has become an absolutely tedious game to play. It would be a reasonable feature if the click speed determined the swing speed, but each sword has its built-in swing speed - meaning you have to click in rhythm with the game. In situations where you're getting swarmed by enemies and mash the mouse button in a panic, you achieve nothing.   These weak swords completely break the game by killing the players motivation to make progress. Also, not being able to change the screen resolution is worse than Hitler. Terarria could be a great game if you were allowed some customization, but as it is - it's terrible.
7334	0	a	Wont let me play the game  
7335	0	a	Superminecraftkid's famous words:  'Hey guys Superminecraftkid here, and I just got TERRARIA. WHAT? IS THIS GAME? ITS A F**KING RIPOFF LIKE LOOK AT THIS! PICKAXE? PICKAXE?!?!?! ARE YOU F**CKING KIDDING ME? And a sword? Look at this a swo- sw- sword!? A sh***y a** sword and look at this! JUMP? its just like f***ing minecraft BUT IN 2D!! This just makes minecraft better because its 3D!!! Why would you want to play that 2 f**king D when you can play the same game but better not a ripoff and in 3 F**KING D! ALSO DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS 2 F**KING D? MARIO! I HATE THAT F**KING GAME!!!! WHY WOULD I WANT TO BUY TERRARIA IF I HATE MARIO?!?!?!? Ok lets get some f***ing wood! WAIT! where have I seen this before? OH YEAH F***ING MINECRAFT!'  Link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITnwynqm1XY  Read along :)
7336	0	a	Its fun cause its minecraft but better and its 2d like legend of zelda so they game is a clone i dislike it
7337	0	a	This game was a dissapointment. The animations are terrible, the game mechanics are so confusing, multiplayer rarely connects and it's a straight out ripoff of Minecraft. I'm currently getting a refund for this game, because it was a waste of my Steam giftcard.
7338	0	a	Got boring after about 7 hours. 7/10 wouldn't waste seven hours again.
7339	0	a	THis crap got rid of my worlds and chacters
7340	0	a	good as mate
7341	0	a	The Description is wrong. Nothing is impossible except a 3d game. Minecraft is better than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. For all you haters:   This is just my opinion
7342	0	a	Dont like it. Its silly. 1.1/10
7343	0	a	There is definitely an addictive quality to this game, but it needs a great deal of work done.   The most obvious flaw is the graphics. With an HD monitor, the sprites are too small and need to be resized. Textures are not the same sizes, so you end up with background walls overlapping foreground walls, making structures look extremely shoddy. Lastly, there are too many visual effects for the overall graphics of the game to be so poor. This just makes the designers look lazy.  In the end, I would still rather play Ultima Online, which is where this game got most of its ideas. It is almost twenty years old and still looks better than this.
7344	0	a	This game is ok. I'm not saying I don't like it, it's just not that exciting to me. It seems to be a knock-off of Minecraft. I wouldn't get really into it.
7345	0	a	'Too much corrupt files' 10/10 ~IGN
7346	0	a	itÂ´s a good game only if you play with friends. this review is just for people that donÂ´t have friends that play terraria and that think survival games are a little boring. the rest igonre this review
7347	0	a	not that fun honestly
7348	0	a	Nice game all in all. However, the user interface is like sooo bad, that instead of putting the results of an hour of mining into a chest, I put it into the trash accidentally. Both of it is shift click, one with a chest open, one without. And I thought the chest was open, because usually you access the abilities of a nearby placable by simply opening your inventory (ESC key... ..!) True for everything, except chests. Also, scrolling through the crafting recipes (which you have to do it with every single crafting operation) is just soooo sloooow, yooouu haaave toooo waaait fooor eeeveeeryyyy siiingleee iiiiteeeem to slooowlyyyy paaass throoough. And there's like hundreds. Game is really nice, but the user interface is sooo inconsistent, it actually convinced me the game is a waste of time.
7349	0	a	I Love The Game But If You Want A Game Alot Like This But With A Epic Story And Adventure Or Just To Explore With Friends also With More Cool Things To Find Then Get Starbound.
7350	0	a	this game is crap

7392	0	a	I personally belive that when 1.1 was released... They â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. The game was perfect before
7393	0	a	Game was fun in 2014, but after the big update it is unplayable in multiplayer.  Host lags when making dedicated server, tunngle and hamachi dont fix anything, hosting on steam is laggy for the people who join so it's impossible to do expert mode. We cannot even beat the first boss because the game is so laggy. :( I'ts been a year since this started and there seems to be no fix.  This is a problem at least 2 people I know have but I guess most people dont?? If you know the fix please add a comment!
7394	0	a	I've been having problems running the game... When I try to open it from my home screen it won't open after I try to re-try my connection due to connection errors, and it will not let me open steam nor terraria for about 8 hours after. This is extremely frustrating. Is there any way to fix this issue?   
7395	0	a	As a game i love terraria as i play it on ps4, however the PC version of terraria is extreamly laggy and sometimes its slowmotion and this makes the game totally unplayable.
7396	0	a	I changed up some setting with my mouse and now i cant even play without it bugging out im littearlly stuck in the home screen and i just bought it  
7397	0	a	This game was great but is now absolute trash. Coming with the new update has come the inability to rebind any key whatsoever. After trying litterally almost 20 different keyboards and tons of different setups ive divined that the game is broken and terrible.
7398	0	a	Changed my review. The game is still bad. I enjoy a few aspects of it but it really is not entirely fun. IReason as to why I say this is because:  1. resources are almost worthless. I never even used copper or tin, went straight to the next tier lead, then silver, then shadow and some hellmetal armour. So half of the ore content in this game is worthless.  2. As said in my review before, you cannot craft even some of the most easiest things to craft, like rope.  3. I sort of like this but mainly hate it, you need a 'special' item for everything. Going to the land down under? Well then find, mainly find, or craft the item associated to that place to barely function.  4. They really tried to make the water physics work but they don't. Randomly, my entire mine shaft flooded and it was glitched to where it could not be removed, they acted like indestructable placed blocks. Much more to be said but I will not bore.  5. Mobs are pointless in a way. Once you have met 4 different enemies (zombie, eye, slime, mage) you have met em all. The creators barely alter the enemies' stats and maybe give them an ablility then give them a new skin with little to no animation and blamo, a new enemy.  6. Planting system sux in this game. It is just horrible. I barely get any seeds from my plants and blooming the plants is almost impossible because of all their special requirements. Too annoying to deal with.  7. The largest beef I have with this game is the fact that it almost forces you to look up a wiki, which I refuse to do. The crafting recipies are so ridiculous and the items are so random that guessing what they are is nearly impossible like knowing to combine a hell metal with obsidian to make an ingot. You would imagine that you could just smelt the metal but no, you must add the obsidian in order to craft it.  8. Another huge thing I dispise about this game is that 65% of the crafting recipies are worthless. People say there is so much to this game but most of it is copy and paste with a new skin and it is useless. It is nice to have a diverse background but when it consists of 65% of the game, then it is pointless.  Now before you are like 'you did not try the game out' 'you have the attention span of a 1 year old child' I tried the game out. I went through it and played a decent amount of time. I have seen a great chunk of it. It is okay to fight bosses, build a base, and play sim city but it is just missing a lot. I mean for crying out load, the bee and eye of cathulcabbage, forgot the name, have the same attack sound effect and attack strats. That is just lazy at its core. The eater of worlds is just a bigger worm, that I crushed only losing at max 80 health... really. The bosses are all push overs even with pathetic armour and weapons. It is just missing the diversity all people claim it has. I only got it to play with my bromines. Without them, I simply could not play the game as we compete and constantly raid each other's bases, there are regulations behind how to raid making it unique, thats a game on its own and way too long to describe.   Overall, 3.5/10
7399	0	a	Terriaria is a bad game because its gameplay is terrible, its sandblocks are bad, the world isn't big and so much more. I can't list all the bad this about this game because there is so much to hate about this game!

7401	0	a	not worth playing
7402	0	a	This game is boring. Don't buy it.
7403	0	a	Oh, where do I start. Obviously, like most game developers, they realized that having fast and cheap graphics flies nowadays. But these developers took after Minecraft a little bit more. They decided to make a carbon copy for the most part, but adding more stuff. Sure there is more features, and there is less to worry about in a 2D landscape instead of Minecraft's 3D landscape. I can make this simple that all the Developers were hoping for was that it would be more popular than Minecraft because it has more features and more to do after a while. And because they had put this game in front of the Console market and of course, The Steam Market, they cashed out very well. This game is not good in general, and most of you reading this review will hate me for saying that. The Developers got lucky with this and probably converted many of the Minecraft community into this. The Developers may claim this game was 'inspired' by Mojang's Masterpiece but I just hate to see a game that's a copy of another get popular. Bottomline, Personally I just see this as a terrible copy of Minecraft in the least. I do enjoy this game a bit, but I just can't seem to get the Minecraft copy out of my mind. So, I don't reccommend this game.
7404	0	a	its ok but when ur done doing everything u should uninstall because its boring after no replayability nono
7405	0	a	This game is just flat out boring :/
7406	0	a	Terrible game bought to play with cuzins and got bored in like 2 seconds but way better than minecraft
7407	0	a	my little brother has become stupid 10/10 ign for stupidity
7408	0	a	For the third installment of the black ops series i find this game highly offensive, nearly dropping all of the elements of a shooter and moving generally towards a sandbox rpg. 1/10 IGN
7409	0	a	I want to like this game. But every time I start enjoying it, it rips it all up with frustration and tedium. Unless you are ready to spend 100s of hours grinding, you love collecting useless crap, adore building elaborate structures for purely aesthetic reasons and you enjoy guesswork and trial-and-error gameplay, don't buy Terraria. Here are the main reasons I wouldn't recommend this game:  - You die all the time. Monsters, lava pits, random boss encounters, arbitrary unwanted Hard mode activation, you name it. - Dying and travelling back to where you died to collect your corpse takes about 1/3 of total game time. Even with rudimentary recall function, eventual mounts and buildable railway systems. - The sheer number of items in this game is insane. Most of them are just decorative or peripheral to gameplay. There is basically no info, context or explanation to guide meaningful choices. - Organising your items is a chore. It takes up another 1/3 of game time. There are practically no quality-of-life functions to streamline the experience. - The crafting system is tedious, with way too many crafting stations, no structure and trial-and-error recipes. - Having the unofficial Terraria Wiki on alt-tab is a must if you want any inkling of what you're doing. - When was the last time in a game where you had to repeatedly click the mouse button for every single swing of your sword? - The music is insufferable and the measly 3-4 tracks will drive you nuts within 10 minutes. - Graphics and animation are so bare-bones that half of the stuff is unrecognisable and the rest is just ugly. - Exploration of the randomly-generated worlds is genuinely entertaining. But that is what you do the least amount of time because of all the forced labor to get there.  If you like Minecraft and that sort of open-ended sandbox experience, you will probably find things to like about Terraria. If you are looking for decent RPG elements, any sort of semblance of a story or interesting characters, acceptable graphics, value your carpal tunnel and like to spend time doing fun things in games, this is not for you.
7410	0	a	The game progresses in a very linear way, so there is virtually no replayability. The combat is not good at all, and it takes hours of mining to get good enough things to fight a boss, and then you have to mine to get new things to fight the next boss, and it goes on and on. It gets to a point where you have to kill enemies over and over to get an incredibly rare drop to make something that gets you a bit stronger, so you can even attempt fighting the next boss. The building is not fun at all, because in 2D, it is extremely difficult to do. You will end up building a wooden box as a house. It gets boring (and annoying) very quickly.
7411	0	a	I have to say good game...  But at the start of the game exploring =no   If you do not handle frustration DONT GET!
7412	0	a	It's an ok game, but I find that it gets really boring quickly.
7413	0	a	I really wish I could actually get to enjoy and play this game.. I do.. But I've tried running this on my windows 7 pc and every time I load the game It's just a black screen with a map. No matter what I put my game setting to it's always just a black screen. My pc is more than capable of running this game, but for some reason.. something about this game or my pc doesn't want to cooperate and make sit unplayable.
7414	0	a	I'm 50/50 on this game so far. I dont like how I have to play it as an admin on my system which causes issues for my shared library with my kids on the same computer.   There looks to be no work around for this at the moment. :(
7415	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS FRICKEN CRAP
7416	0	a	when i got out of my game my building i was working on disappears even thought it was on the mini map please fix this it happened after i got out of terraria when the load screen froze at saving world 100% and my inventory was the same as i finished it and my game had cloned some of my stuff i had in my inventory this is mac os computer
7417	0	a	Do you like grinding, do you like unicorns? I don't. No thanks.
7418	0	a	Very detailed 2D minecraft-sort-of-but-not-quite game. I'd totally recommend this, except I can't see what the crap I'm doing because everything is tiny, and the only way to fix this is to change your desktop resolution.
7419	0	a	SCREW THE CRAWLIPIEDS!!!!!!!!
7420	0	a	The game has much to offer. That is a fact. There are a ton of great aspects to the game including simply playability and lots of variety in gear and appearance. However MULTIPLAYER IS HORRIBLE!!! Especially at the end game content. THERE IS SO MUCH LAG ON EVERY SERVER HOSTED BY ANYONE AND EVERYONE!!!   Honestly that's the worst of the game aside from some content simply being overwhelming and the screen becomes so full the cursors are lost (why did they prevent us players from being able to SEE THE CURSOR WHEN THE SCREEN IS FULL OF FIGHT??!?!?!?!), traps are lost and death comes soon. Frost and Pumpkin moons are just death incarnate no matter the circumstance. Yes they are beatable and yes there is entertainment value in them. I cannot recommend this game for any price point above $5.   Oh and you might as well get super familiar with the wiki pages because the game is basically unplayable without them.   Hardcore mode on Expert worlds is absolute fun and an extreme challenge. That's probably the best part of the game; that one can go super easy mode and kill everything (until end game content then its just death or preparation) or one can go pure skill and cheese and try to survive as long as possible.  Overall 6/10. Add a better cursor (yes you can change the color but they use EVERY COLOR in the game) and sell this game for $5 or less or add a better multiplayer option this game gets a 10/10
7421	0	a	This is a cute game that gives you lots of freedom to do whatever you want, but I do not like it's UI at all. It feels like it may work well enough for a touch screen, but not keyboard and mouse. It doesn't have any story that I have seen but I didn't play it that much.
7422	0	a	missing exclucible wtf 
7423	0	a	haha copy of minecraft dont even play it dude

7426	0	a	Made in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ technology (XNA and .NET Framework) doesn't work on most computers at all.
7427	0	a	This game, I guess might be fun for your 7 year old cousin, but this game is probably not good for any regular person over 11, I am currently in my teens and me and my mate got adicted to it! All was well and a week later we were saying that the game was, quite frankly, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Sorry to all of you hardcore terraria fans out there and im sure there are some of you out there, I think I might just stick to my CS-GO and portal 2, of which this game does not compare.  We can see the potential for this game but we can never get past the facts that it will never blow up like games like minecraft witch it is obviously trying to be. Sorry but this game does not nearly reach my level of expextactions and hopefully will find its way into our novalty shelf of old games amongst the wand of gamelon and ET the video game.  All harmfull views aside terraria is acctially an ok game with a good processing speed and no major glitches to recall. And if you were thinking of getting this for your 8 year old son/daughter I would reccommend it and I say, go for it! Just do your 13+ year old children a favour and NEVER get them this game, unless of corse you want them immediatly talking about you behind your backs, saying to their mates, 'oi, my mum just got me terraria for christmas ROFL, ill get revenge next year by getting her minecraft!'

7437	0	a	This is one of the best multilayer games that I have played but really? nobody does it legit everybody downloads maps and gets free items (I did that too) the game is way too long to actually complete it the proper way and it soooo hard to defeat the first boss without really good pre hard mode weapons like the nights edge. My advice... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME IT IS JUST A RIP OFF OF MINECRAFT, IT DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE ON STEAM ANDIT COSTS WAY TOO MUCH.  X(
7438	0	a	I bought the game but it says a bunch of stuff that wont let me play ,and I re-install it and it wont work I demand refund pls (March ,15 ,2016) for all them haters YES i did fix it now leave me alone so i can play it

7459	0	a	I haven't played this game much, but I don't really like it. Even though the concept seems kind of cool, the camera is way too far back. This is one of those games where everything is the size of a little icon.  I could see why people would like this game, as you get to explore, but this is a meh from me.
7460	0	a	Pls,this version keeps freezing and I can't even open it. Fix it pls. 
7461	0	a	i hate this game so much.
7462	0	a	When I added this game to my wishlist, I thought it might be interesting. And if you like Minecraft, then by all means, buy this game. If however, like me, you find it rather simplistic and boring then you'll want to give this game a pass.
7463	0	a	rocket racoon is in this game but you have to pay moey to playu him add me on steam if u want to knoow how to get for free
7464	0	a	WELL I CANT ENTER HARDMODE BECAUSE THE GUIDE IS DEAD SO I CANT ENTER HARDMODE WHY CANT YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE TO SUMMON WALL OF FLESH IT IS STUPID FIX IT

7466	0	a	I guess its worth a dollar or two on â™¥â™¥â™¥. 4/10
7467	0	a	So someone gifts me this game. Ok, I guess I'll give it a try.  I launch the game, start game, etc etc, and here I am sitting atop a 2D world of procedurally generated terrain. There's no instructions on how to do anything, so I'm stuck with an empty inventory, a giant world, and a companion that doesn't seem to be able to do anything.  In short, there was no tutorial or objective given, so apparently I was just supposed to run around and dig holes or something.  It's not that I don't understand the sandbox part of the game, since I have gmod and I understand making cool stuff on your own... but this game... this game is directionless.
7468	0	a	BRO TO REALLY PLAY THE TERRARIA U GOTTA BE THE TERRARIA
7469	0	a	Hard Mode ultimately ruined this game for me. For those who don't know, once summon the boss 'Wall of Flesh' and kill it, your world becomes plagued with one-shot enemies, frustrating bosses, and tedious grinding. Even after spending hours trying to get the best weapons and armor, enemies still do a fourth of my HP and healing items only heal a sixth every 20 seconds.  If your patience levels rival that of Jesus Christ, then maybe you'll be able to survive the unfair deaths and grinding.
7470	0	a	This game is really, really boring.
7471	0	a	Absence of controller support in windows - meh
7472	0	a	I want my money back to be honest. Bought this game just then since I used to play it on Xbox and me and my friend wanted to play it. Literally cannot join him. I only bought it so me and him can play it and I can't even do that much.
7473	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game
7474	0	a	I've got my brightness setting on my monitor set on the highest setting, and I still cannot see a damn thing in the game when its at night. I thought the mobile version was too dark...with the PC version, I can't even see the zombie right in front of me.
7475	0	a	This game isnt minecraft WTF?????????????????
7476	0	a	At first it seemed fun, mining was not always accurate and getting started building things took some research on wiki's but that's fine. Then I saw what it took to get upgrades, how the crafting UI looked, how confining the game felt and I lost all motivation to continue.

7494	0	a	This game is so horrible. I really can't believe why people would like this. Minecraft, the game which Terraria copied, is much more superior. The green slimes don't even do anything. The zombies are way too hard to beat. What kind of game is this? This sucks SO bad......  Cons of Terraria: I have played for 2 hours, figuring out what to do. What do I do? There should be a tutorial. This is a complete clone of Minecraft. Why the heck is it so dark at night time? The 'adventuristic' concept is unrealistic in this game. It's so bad, it doesn't even need a good computer!

7498	0	a	Unlss you have a lot of time on your hands, this is not the game for you.  The gameplay is meh at best and you can't do anything unless you spend 5-6 hours getting a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of materials to make all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to be able to do other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to be able to do other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and THEN stuff remotely intersting starts happening just because you have most of the items in the game at that point, which leaves you ith nothing to do but farm off of bosses over and over again.  Also, people are like 'I beat a super hard boss on my own! I must be so pro!' or 'I beat the chuthulu monsters and wall of flesh at the same time on my own!'. The bosses are reitavely difficult, i'll give them that, but all you have to do is find a glitch in the system, abuse it and have all the best weapons to kill them. There is no kind of skill or rewarding feeling in it. It's jus tlike: 'You abused a glitch! Good job you sad â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!'  That is why I don't reccomend Terraria and LET THE HATE AND NON HELPFUL FEEDBACK TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE MAIN REVIEW PAGE COMMENCE!!
7499	0	a	Was killed by bunny 0/10 would not recommend
7500	0	a	Do you want to create you world and play multiplayer with your friends? To bad, to do it you need to be a tech savvy and expert on servers and internet communications protocols, after that just watch 3 hours of videos and tutorials about how to host a game and... well I bet you will still fail.
7501	0	a	IT Keeps FREEZING!! I can't play it!!!!!
7502	0	a	I was playing and i left the game and i randomly crashed.... so i checked my world and the name has changed to 'world' and everytime i would open it it would be a black screen.... WTFFFF am i expected to make a backup file? 80 HOURS GOOOOONE :(((((((
7503	0	a	  Too overwhelming. And with no tutorial... Not for me
7504	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all of this, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ red.   This game is fantastic! The core gameplay might get boring but challenging yourself to a different play style or just cheating in items and trying to defeat bosses with a stupid loadout or armor set, or even try and beat the final boss on the hard difficulty with the lowest amount of health possible (Somebody has actually done that), this game is fantastic.  However, I'd like to point out why I don't recommend this game.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THE ANGLER  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ HIM BEND HIM OVER AND LET A VERY LARGE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ENTER HIS â™¥â™¥â™¥. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ RANDOM DROPS  What's the angler? A little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who never gives you what you want from him.  NPC's are easy, you get the money, you use the money to buy the thing you want. The angler? He randomly gives you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ after you give him fish. I get so frustrated at this little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing make traps for him just so he could fall down and I could laugh as he slowly suffocates to death.   There are also enemies that have random drops, and I tried to get a daedalous stormbow from a hallow mimic, which is a 1/4 chance, and it took me 14 tries just for him to give it to me. I gave this game up for months after the 12th try. I should also mention that spawning in a hallowed mimic is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hell. The game confuses you and tries to make you spawn in bosses on accident. Here's a list of bosses that an average player might spawn in on accident:   Eye of cthulhu (The tooltip on the SLE does not mention that it spawns in this boss)  Skeletron (The old man does not mention that the curse option spawns in skeletron) Slime King (Killing too many slimes in the raining slimes event triggers him without warning)  Eater of worlds/Brain of cthulhu (The guide tells you to break the orbs, but does not tell you that breaking 3 triggers the BoC/EoW)  Wall of Flesh (Nothing mentions that the voodoo demons drop the guide doll, and if you kill a voodoo demon hovering over lava and you aren't aware of this fact, you will not be prepared to fight the WoF)  Golem (You are given plenty of his spawners, however most players aren't aware that using them will spawn in golem)  Martial Madness (This is more of an event, and not a boss, however most players aren't aware that letting the probe escape, which will inevitably happen for someone who doesn't know what the probe does, will trigger this event.  Duke Fishron (You might get an ocean fishing quest and have a truffle worm in your inventory. Use your imagination)  Lunatic Cultist (The first instinct a player will get when seeing the worshippers is to kill them, use your imagination)   All of these have happened to me. ALL OF THEM.   Alright, one more thing to toss up about terraria: The cellphone. The cellphone cannot be built without using wikipedia, ENOUGH SAID. The Cellphone is incredibly useful, so it should be hard to get right? Nope, you just have to be lucky. You have to be lucky that an enemy will give you a 1/100 chance drop, you have to be lucky for the angler to give you all of the required items in less than one hundred quests, you have to be lucky. I couldn't get the last item for the cellphone, so you know what I did? I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cheated it in.   I felt so unrewarded I went out and deleted the cellphone, which took me hundreds of hours to get. I got all of the required items in 10 hours, the rest of those hours was the angler being a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. From now on, I'm cheating in ALL of the angler items because they're all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing useless anyway, and I'll tell you why.  1. The first item tells you what moon phase it is. This is only helpful if you have a wikipedia page open about moon phases 2. The second item tells you the weather, even though the weather only minorly effects things.  3. The third item tells you your fishing power. I always add up my fishing power, I know how much fishing power I have at all times. This item is useless for me and is only slightly helpful for items that don't tell you how much fishing power they add.   And I'm not exaggerating, it took me hundreds of hours. ALL IN ALL: If you're a completionist, over achiever, or control freak, don't buy this game.  If you're a normal person, why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ not? It's 10 bucks and it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing worth it. The game has a slow start but things get very fast in hardmode.
7505	0	a	I've honestly tried getting into this game numerous times, but failed every time. I just don't find it fun. At all. You have better games to spend your time and money on.
7506	0	a	I find my self getting really bored playing this game. If you like to craft thing's mine thing's, I guess it's a game for you I find it confusing and a total waist of time, it pretty much looks like some thing form the 80s. nothing wrong with that So ive only played a short time ill collect my cards and erase it, If you get it on sale maby worth $2.99 but it's not a $10 game my opinion .. Yeah i'm going to get alot of hate from my opinion but's it's mine.. Not a game for me..

7513	0	a	This Game Wasn't That Enjoyable In My Opinion, I got It To Play With My Friend But Quickly I Realized The Game Was Boring to The Fullest Extent. I Think The Reason Why I Didn't Like It Becuae It's NOTHING Like Minecraft, That's A WAY Better Game In My Opinion, Alot More Than 2D, Its 3D. I Wouldn't Recommend This Game Thgo
7514	0	a	Just a copy off of minecraft, when minecraft was good, same with this game

7520	0	a	Terreria is a fun monster-fighting, exploring, survival game, riddled with peril and adventure!  Unfortunately, I cannot reccomend this game.  Why, you ask? As I said above, the game is quite fun. I shall go into detail on the game.   -----Gameplay-----  The gameplay is quite fun, filled with crazy fighting against crazier, random monsters. The object of the game is to survive, and build a villiage, to attract the townspeople.  However, the game wears itself out. At first, the game is a bit slow, due to the fact that navigating the rugged terrain is a nightmare with starting equipment. After a while, you start to pick up steam, get better equipment, when suddenly, the realization hits -- You are playing to get the next set of equipment. That is all it eventually adds up too, grinding for the next tier.  4/10 -----Controls-----  The controls are a bit clunky, due to the side-scrolling nature. This isn't that much of a problem, except on difficult terrain, which makes it a nightmare to go anywhere without falling into a pit of zombies. This is especially true down in caves.  However, the perils add to the fun, to an extent -- then you get tired of falling further into the cave with no way out.  7/10 -----Graphics-----  The pixalated graphics are very fun, and the monsters are a hoot to fight. They reflect the light mood of the game, although some effects are kind of gruesome.  9.5/10  -----Overall-----  Like I said, the game is enjoyable, until the grinding starts. I got the game for %70 off, so I feel like I didn't waste any money.  Sadly, I do not recommend, except on sale.  5/10

7556	0	a	The most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing insanely boring and biggest waste of time game I have ever played. It is a 2D Minecraft with more items. Once you beat the story for the first time which is extremely quick and easy the game is boring. Cannot believe I spend 20 hours on this game.

7558	0	a	Great game, enjoyed it.
7559	0	a	The whole 2D aspect of the game doesn't really spark my interest, so when I launched it and got into the world, I was bored after a couple of minutes. I can see why this game would be fun towards much younger audiences, but it doesn't awe or amaze me to any degree.
7560	0	a	i would rather shoot up my family then play this game.
7561	0	a	The gameplay is fun, and challenging, but it's no fun building up a large game file and then losing it the next time you turn on your computer.  This game has a nasty glitch that deletes your game files, seemingly at random. Although, I'm not sure if it's the game itself or Steam's synching mechanism because it seems to happen when I have to log back in.  Either way, it wasn't a good introduction to this site and frankly $3.00 (on sale) isn't enough to keep me invested.  Also, they try to say you can set up a link account to a third party server to backup your gamefiles or something, but, honestly, what's the point? If the game doesn't work internally or on the site, it's just a bad product!
7562	0	a	ReLogic YOU BETTER LISTEN! My world disappeared with my meowmere, vampire knives, ufo mount, bone key, and every other important item to me. Not to mention that i put all my important items in chests because my character disapears, and i lose everything in my inventory. on a scale of one to ten 0. 0 STARS. I HATE YOU RELOGIC. I WILL BE TELLING MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS SORRY EXCUSE FOR A GAME. AND I WILL BE PLAYING A MUCH BETTER GAME G MOD, CUZ GMOD DOESN'T LET ME LOSE MY GOOD PROGRESS

7569	0	a	I LOVED THE GAME I still do but when i was playing on a world with my friend after spending hours building we crashed and when i got back on the word was gone(corrupted) THEN i was ok i decided i will make another world for me and my friend then after getting back to the same point of hours and stuff it crashed....the world was gone againcorrupted IT HAPPEND 2 TIMES. dont get me wrong this game is a master peice but i dont trust it with my hours of work and grinding anymore thus im probably never going to play it again. On the other hand if it never corrupts you its the best game ever...
7570	0	a	This game sucks!             Nah this game is better than minecraft ;). This game rocks if you like Adventure. I miss clicked the thumbs down button. Terraria isn't 2d Minecraft and even though I only have like 22 hours on record I first started playing the pocket version and spent 100s of hours on that so yeah...
7571	0	a	i feel like this is one of those games where you cant just play for long periods of time
7572	0	a	What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ did you just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing say about me, you little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? Iâ€™ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Iâ€™ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Iâ€™m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing words. You think you can get away with saying that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to me over the Internet? Think again, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youâ€™re â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thatâ€™s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable â™¥â™¥â™¥ off the face of the continent, you little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little â€œcleverâ€ comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing tongue. But you couldnâ€™t, you didnâ€™t, and now youâ€™re paying the price, you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ idiot. I will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youâ€™re â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dead, kiddo.

7576	0	a	Want a game which is essentially a 2D Minecraft? Then maybe Terraria is for you.  This statement will make a lot of people angry; you might say â€œTerraria is nothing like Minecraftâ€, or â€œTerraria is about gathering items and fighting monstersâ€ and maybe â€œthey arenâ€™t even comparableâ€. Iâ€™ve discovered the reason why many of you will be thinking like this, and itâ€™s a very clever trick from the developers of Terraria.  After the â€œdevelopersâ€ of Terraria successfully converted 3D Minecraft to 2D Minecraft, they realised that everyone will know that the game is a copy. In order to hide this, they changed up some of the sprites and items in the game. For example, the dirt block looks slightly different in Terraria than it does in Minecraft. This is done to give the illusion that Terraria is actually a different game.   Now here is what I donâ€™t understand, why would you want to make a copy of a game which already sucks? Minecraft is clearly a kids game, itâ€™s very similar to Lego (except you are building stuff on a computer) and the graphics are just absolutely terrible. Iâ€™d also like to mention that Minecraft claims to be a survival game, yet it is one of the most unrealistic games Iâ€™ve ever played in my life.  Please donâ€™t get Terraria, all they did was put Minecraft through a â€œ3D to 2D Converterâ€ and just waited for the game to finish converting. Sure, they changed some sprites here and there, but deep down the two games are nearly identical.  Avoid both of them at all costs.
7577	0	a	CAN YOU BAN ALL SERVERS THAT GIVE FREE ITEMS CAUsE WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT YOU CAN CHEAT ITEMS, PLAYING TERRARIA HAS NO PURPOSE I AM SOOO SAD THAT I CAN CHEAT I WISH I COULD ERASE MY MEMORY OF HOW TO CHEAT  
7578	0	a	THIS GAME HAS A ULTIMATE PROBLEM WITH MULTIPLAYER
7579	0	a	My main complaint would be that there is too much dlc in this pay to win fps horror game. In terraria, you are forced to do its uncreative storyline, killing ants on a small stage, and not allowed you to create anything on your own.  Only saving grace of the game would be the fact that I recovered from autism shortly after installing it  1/10 barely better than minecreeper

7586	0	a	omg dis gayme is liek mincraft it suks my bawls and shud go die in a h0le
7587	0	a	I'll be frank: Terraria frightens me. Not because of anything that would conventionaally scare someone, like creepy atmosphere or startling enemies. Terraria frightens me because of the mind-boggling amount of content.  And that's not a backhanded compliment. It's genuinely disturbing how many things are in this game, and even more disturbing how few of them are original ideas. The wiki is bloated and often self-contradictory because the unbelievable volume of enemies, bosses, biomes, and items - oh dear god the items - make it impossible to keep updated. Redigit - the man I am given to understand leads development - has a penchant for adding things to the game that he recently saw somewhere else. The Crimson biome, for instance, apparently showed up right after Redigit saw 'The Red Weed', a theatrical performance based on 'War of the Worlds'. More recently - and more blatantly - Redigit added an entire new weapon class - yoyos. The kicker? Many of them are exact likenesses of yoyos made by One Drop - and One Drop has even agreed to manufacture a real version of a yoyo Redigit programmed to drop from Terraria's final boss. Of course it doesn't stop there. I would bet money that literally 50% or more of the items in Terraria are references or direct ripoffs of things in other media. The SDMG - Space Dolphin Machine Gun - references the game 'Edge of Space'. Costumes galore parody popular culture - including, ironically enough, other, better games.  Moving on from the unoriginal nature of the vast and overwhelming content we rapidly encounter another problem: Difficulty. The difficulty curve, to be exact. It's backwards. I'm not exaggerating here. No matter how much the enemies are buffed or replaced with smarter, more dangerous versions the game only gets easier. And it gets a LOT easier, considering how asinine the game can be early on. Enemies that belong in the endgame randomly float though walls while low-level players are desperately mining in hopes of crafting marginally better armor and weapons. Yet as soon as they have defeated Skeletron Prime the game becomes a cakewalk. Even the final boss - an eldritch horror that makes the whole screen shake and go gray - can be farmed on Expert mode with the right equipment.  Even on a smaller level the balance is wonky all over the place. Ex 1: The game has eight basic ores in four tiers, with each world choosing one of two four times to get a semirandom assortment upon being generated. The problem? One set of ores is slightly better. A world can generate with a tier-2 ore, for example, just as useful as - or even more than - the tier 3 ore, despite being twice as common and half as valuable. Lead and Silver: Lead has significantly more applications, and is more common than Silver; yet Lead armor is just as strong as Silver, and Lead weapons just as powerful. Silver is effectively useless, especially since it is harder to find. If these ores happen to generate in the same world, the player is effectively left without a tier-3 ore and has to exert much more effort to make better gear by finding the significantly rarer Gold or Platinum. Ex 2: Three main styles of combat exist: Melee, Ranged, and Arcane. While swords and bows are easy to craft and use immediately, early-game magic weapons were unheard-of until update 1.2, which added Staves. Even now these staves are poorly balanced - early on, mana doesn't regenerate as fast as the staves seem to think they should - and inordinately difficult to craft, with each staff requiring a lot of a different, specific, and largely arbitrary gemstone the player has no garauntee of finding.  I could go on for days about the myriad flaws and highly questionable design choices that make Terraria poorly-balanced, buggy, and bloated - the frustration of characters' snail-like default speed, the suicidal stupidity of the NPCs, the arbitrarily low drop rates of desirable items - but I want to keep this review readable.  Terraria was once a joyful adventure through a fantastical 2D retro pixel land, with exciting and original ideas. I would reccommend that game - seriously, if you can find a version before 1.2, play that. But the Terraria on Steam today is an unoriginal, overinflated, glitchy, unbalanced mess. If someone gifts it to you, by all means play it up to the Wall of Flesh. But don't bother playing past that, and certainly don't spend any money on it.

If you play this just to let you know back in 1980s there was a mario game, would really love you all to play it first and compare both because, holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the graphics are real.
7591	0	a	Doesn`t appear to have a functioning set of controls for left-handed people who bought the game. Does not appear to allow Controller suppport. Thus, It cant be played by this customer as a game should allow. It also has a rancid community with a Mod who appears unblalanced mentally and socially. Avoid the forums like the plague if you the controls refuse to re-map; or you will be attacked, and then given a lifetime ban by an abuser supporter.

7597	0	a	terraria is the game you play for a week straight then never touch it again untill its updated again and you do this over the course of 3 years because of how slow the updates are
7598	0	a	I've played it. Quality game. best game i've ever dun diddily playedd
7599	0	a	I'm not giving it a thumbs down because it reminds me of Minecraft .. but rather, the game itself has several issues.  In order to even play with someone else... you have to do ALL kinds of coding. Like, knowing their server's number along with digits. Then you have to type the password in to unlock entering their world. The worst offender is that usually you can't connect because the servers are bad.  Playing by yourself is alright, but some of the enemies will be to much of a hassle in dealing with. They can even phase through the floor and hurt you badly. I didn't enjoy this to much.
7600	0	a	Got this game off a sale. Never played a sandbox game before so I decided to give it a try, and here is my impression:  I learnt that in a sandbox game, you would have to collect blocks (in this case via mining) and then put these raw blocks together to make a shelters, platforms and the likes. While there is absolutely no need to, you could also upgrade these buillding blocks by refining or even mixing different types together to make your structures look better.  At the start, it is pretty overwhelming in the sense that there are so many places to explore, different mobs to fight, and also multiple seemingly random events that would happen. Thankfully, there is a kind NPC named The Guide who points you in the direction on what you should focus on next. Soon you find yourself facing the first boss and this keeps you interested in the game as you prepare for the future bosses, crafting stronger weapons and exploring further and deeper.  This game called to my inner OCD, and eventually I find myself clocking a total of 52 hours in gameplay. And here's the twist: I don't even like the genre. Yes, this game isn't for me, but being able to suck me in for ~50 hours says something about it. Afterall, it is one of the best of its genre (97% positive reviews) and I'm glad I tried it.  Overall, I choose not to recommend this game. The pushing factor being that if anyone were to read this review, it would be people on my friend list, and majority of them would not enjoy the genre either. However, like all my reviews, I will end with my presonal rating:  6.5/10
7601	0	a	This game sucks. It is over-rated and over-hyped.
7602	0	a	its always too dark, having to constantly put torches everywhere when mining gets annoying.
7603	0	a	not good at all DO NOT BUY IT!!!!! the multiplayer does not even work at all  
7604	0	a	starbound is way better than this bland and boring like sandbox in a playground 3/10
7605	0	a	This game hawe 1 update in 20 years -.-
7606	0	a	Ripe from the time period where every indie developer could make it big by shipping a game that looks just as terrible as castlevania from the nes with one fourth the challenge and depth. Just another 'retro' rip off of any and everything â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ trying to ride minecrafts coat tails to success.

7610	0	a	this game is probably the worst game i may have ever encountered in my life. it just makes me want to take off my pants and sit down in a nice warm chair, only for an autistic kid to walk in the room and give me a nice long good speech about how the korean war was just a setup by cubans. after the speach the kid will take a nice cold glass of milk and proceed to spill it in my lap
7611	0	a	I played this for 18 minutes and never before have I so desperately wanted to commit genocide. 2/10
7612	0	a	Will change reveiw if multiplayer is easyer
7613	0	a	Game looks good, but for me the problem is that I've played Starbound, and comared to it Terraria is very boring.
7614	0	a	This isn't mine craft tf
7615	0	a	As much as everybody around loves Terraria, I don't. The game is boring and pointless, doesn't really show anything new. If you want to buy it, do it when it's on a 90% sale, at least you'll have a free game for your library.
7616	0	a	it was fun at first but slowly and slowly and slowly and slowly over time i started to hate it it faded from 100 hours a week to 0 a year
7617	0	a	Ignore the time spent playing. which for some reason is completely misrepresented, possibly due to a bug. I've played countless hours between the PC version and the Xbox 360 port, and I can say, with vindication, that Terraria is not so much a game as it is a petty time-sink.  Terraria was not inspired by Minecraft. It *is* Minecraft - Minecraft as presented in a two-dimensional space and rendered with sprites. Minecraft is intensely popular, so it stands to reason that this game - which doesn't even really attempt to conceal the fact that it's a blatant copy - is unreasonably popular as well. This game is loved by 12 year olds everywhere, and it's already sold its thousands upon thousands of dollars' worth of copies. But for those few of us 'traditional' gamers who are left sitting on the fence, wondering if this critically-acclaimed Minecraft-esque 'sandbox' might not be so bad after all, take it from me: it's bad. It's very, very bad.  Now, why would I say this while claiming I've played the game for an obscene amount of time? The answer is easy. Games like this are built for the 'grind' - they're constructed for the sole purpose of wasting your life to artificially pad their own extreme lack of depth. If I've played this game, say, 72 hours, then I can say without hesitation that 50 of those hours were spent holding down a directional input and the 'use item' key, watching my character loop a pickaxe swing animation over and over and over again, and waiting.   Strip out this facet of the game, the whole concept of 'mining,' and more than half of the experience is moot - the other half is holding the use item key and bumping yourself into barely-animating 'monsters,' hoping to 'out-DPS' them with your better numbers before they do the same to you. No wonder today's 'gamers' are so enamored with this one. It requires extremely little thought. In lieu of tired-old RPG stat-based mechanics, we have tired, old RPG gear-based number mechanics. The imperative is to grind enough randomly-distributed materials to get palette swapped items with bigger numbers. That's it.  The game wishes to appeal to our innate love for exploration, which is a noble goal, but ultimately it fails in execution. The worlds are randomly generated, but this merely boils down to 'hidden rooms with treasure chests can be here, here, or HERE.' No elaborate, sprawling underground ruins, no crumbling catacombs, no abandoned villages: just a bunch of differently-colored blocks of dirt with scattered structures that serve as an excuse to hold candy-bag treasure chests. Sometimes, the accessories found in these chests hint at fun, and the game toys with the concept of breaking its own rules with double-jumps, rocket boots, and other gravity-defying trinkets, but the game never transcends its one-button aspirations.  A major flaw rests in the core design of the game. The two primary difficulties are both...wrong. The easiest makes it so that you lose only money on death, which was of only minimal use to begin with. With no other penalty for dying, many players just dump their money in a chest, go grind up a bunch of stuff, then throw themselves into the lava to teleport back home, which neuters the game completely and strips it of any challenge or depth. Then the 'mediumcore' mode sees you drop absolutely everything on death, which gives failure the necessary gravitas, but at the same time it makes the game's constant, endless enemy spawns and cheap one-hit deaths stand out as the extreme flaws that they are. Technically the 'you're dead forever' hardcore mode doesn't really count, because your progress is tied to your gear anyway, not your character. If you lose your gear, it's a long, slow trek back to where you were, which often proves next to impossible without help as your mobility is savaged without all those above mentioned accessories, and your character is mauled to death by the weakest of enemies regardless of your own experience with the game. As a straight numbers experience, without your gear, you are essentially dead meat trying to get your stuff back.  For example, have fun getting killed over and over again by the 'King Slime,' a boss that can spawn at random, who will instantly teleport right on top of you and one-shot your freshly respawned, equipment-less character. That's right, he teleports right on top of you, and your starting character is too slow to do anything about it. Either de-log from the game, and lose all of your dropped stuff forever, or tough it out and wait until the boss despawns thirty minutes later. What's not to love about watching your character die and respawn endlessly for a half an hour? Stuff like this shows that the devs really don't bother to analyze some of their ideas at length before just implementing them into the game.  With nothing bridging the gap between 'so easy the entire experience is easily-abused and utterly moot' and 'so frustrating that this game is not worth the increase in blood pressure,' I cannot in good faith recommend it.  On the positive side, the game is very, very good looking. Its deceptively simple sprite art is charming, and the lighting is quite good, especially when outdoors and in the rain. And it's always thrilling to tap a water reservoir and watch a cascade go spilling down a shaft into the caverns below. Occasionally finding a new item that actually changes the way your character interacts with the world is a momentary thrill that fades when you go back to mining the same old dirt tiles five minutes later, in the exact same way you've been doing it for the past 10 hours or so.  It should be mentioned before closing that the game's interface is terrible on the PC version, and, inexplicably, the console version's is infinitely superior. One would think the opposite should be true for this sort of game. Accessing, organzing, and swapping your items is a massive pain and almost impossible to do properly under stress. The keyboard controls for movement are horrible and suffer from noticeable lag - acrobatic feats with the grappling hook, easy enough to pull off with some practice on the console, are next to impossible on the PC version. Ranged weapons are a nightmare to aim, as the best you can do is to point in the general direction of your target - aiming with the regular cursor - and click. And again - that grappling hook! Same mechanic - point in the general direction and click, and hope the game registers the direction properly.  Way too many flaws, way too little effort to elevate itself beyond its Minecraft-aping roots. I would recommend it for its occasional thrills of sort-of-discovey, but only at a deep discount. Even at its modest initial asking price of $10, it's too expensive for a game in which the majority of your time is, inevitably, spent hammering away at rock walls. Which is what you're going to feel like doing with your head in real life with every one of this game's abundant flaws and cheap deaths.
7618	0	a	This game has a niche audience, and if you're not in that audience, you won't like the game. I couldn't figure out the controls - not because I was confused about what to do, but because I had to constantly fight enemies away because they would just gravitate towards me when I was just minding my own business. Don't get me started on the vultures. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ those things.  If you want a 2D Minecraft-esque game, go for it. If you don't like fighting off tons of enemies all at one time, don't go for it. Seriously.
7619	0	a	A good first gen 2d sandbox. Lots to do and plenty of replay value. The developer is the biggest turnoff.  He puts out fluff updates with lame filler content such as reskins and renames of the same monsters, ores, etc. and then of course everyone praises him for doing so.  He should have given us more customization power when hosting. More server side options like controlling world seeding, mob and item spawning, spawn permissions, block destruction permissions, etc. You could get a lot more custom gameplay out of the game after you've experienced it in vanilla if you could do this.  I would have recommended this game before but now that Starbound is about to be released I'll likely never log into Terraria again.   Starbound has lots of the things I wanted to be implemented into Terraria but never were. E.g., ease of modding, better hosting controls, procedural generation, quests, in-game scripting, and so on.  Tiy might not be able to talk about Redigit or Terraria because of the NDA but it's pretty common knowledge that he left the Terraria dev team because Redigit is greedy and was stealing his ideas.   I've got 723 hours into Terraria, I think I'll get at least 3x that into Starbound.
7620	0	a	It isnt really fun its kind of a let down. 
7621	0	a	Dont play there is a jumpscare

7624	0	a	no multiplayer from the start
7625	0	a	I understand my review, if read at all, will be downvoted to hell, but I feel the need to pass on my experience with this piece of garbage as a warning.  I picked up Terraria on a Steam Sale a while back for a couple bucks. I'll be honest, after hearing good things about the game I was excited to give it a shot.   Unfortunately...  No tutorials, bad UI, arbitrary deaths, and the worst crafting system I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. If the game can't compel me to keep playing it in an hour, there's a problem.   I uninstalled and haven't looked back. I would be willing to pay money to get this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ removed from my library. 0/10, You'd be better off playing Minecraft, Trove, or Planet Explorers.
7626	0	a	This sentence is false.
7627	0	a	Waste of my shekels
7628	0	a	I bought this game during a sale at Christmas cos I had a little wallet money left over. Boy, am I glad I got it on sale. It starts off as a good premise, build a house and slowly build a village of NPCs while battling monsters and soon have a fictional village and world of your control, but it took me HOURS to build a basic hut (not least cos, if you play Starbound or Minecraft, a wall isn't a seperate item you need to craft). A week in, playing a few hours every night, I'd only just gotten four NPCs in my village and had taken out one boss simply to go underground (else Skull Guardians one-shot you. You need to kill the boss I did just to dig below a certain level). Every night, monsters would constantly attack me if I was outside (you can't skip to morning) and I once got three blood moons in a row (so three nights where zombies burst into homes and butchered everyone I had just collected). By then, I'd lost all will to carry on in game. Don't get me wrong, Minecraft is like that too but it takes longer before you feel miserably lost to work. In the end, I turned to a map editor to aid me with my problems (like Corruption/Crimson/Hallow, which spawn annoyingly strong enemies and leave massive chasms you need to cross). Not to mention, you can't swim in this game without certain items. Found this out when I jumped into a lake and nearly drowned trying to climb back out.  Terraria has good points, don't get me wrong. IF you can find a working server, then the community is insanely flooded with talent and you'll desire to make even grander designs to match the work of others. The game itself has good ideas, what with the vast collection of items and bosses, and allows customization on a level that Minecraft requires external software to achieve and most of the in-game jokes found (such as certain item descriptions or the tempermental female NPCs on a blood moon) are chuckle worthy. But, at the end of the day, the months of work, the sacrifice of a life required to achieve something so fruitless in game smothers these things.  If you've played Starbound or Minecraft and liked or loved those, only come here if you're ready to break your spine doing simple things. If you've not played either, this game is punishing all the same. Perfect for those obsessed with recreating New York in a videogame and those who love complex RPG systems, terrible for those who just want to have done with it or just wanna play a few hours.
7629	0	a	Game gives me cancer on PC, better on console.

7639	0	a	It's pretty fun. Love this game on android. Played it when it was a beta, but after having played starbound, I wanted to come back but can't cause its annoying as hell having to click like a mad man to attack.   I guess I've been spoiled by games like starbound and diablo that you can just hold a click and keep attacking.  I recommend starbound, though.
7640	0	a	Touted as 'action packed', I found Terraria got boring quite quickly. Too much of a grind, not enough early game reward to keep you motivated. Interface was a bit clunky, and I lost interest in switching items very fast. Not a bad idea, but could have done with more motivation and purpose.

7650	0	a	Add MAC please
7651	0	a	It's really unfortunate. It did not occur to me that a game that is clearly designed with the controls of classic 8 &amp; 16-bit platformers in mind, still doesn't have gamepad functionality. Especcially given the successful console versions.  For many people, this isn't an issue. I, however, have been unable to enjoy playing this game with a keyboard and mouse. Several third-party solutions later, and I still found the experience highly frustrating. I spent hours trying to get into it, but I never managed to transcend the controls.   Which is a shame; there's a genuinely lovely game here.  If such things do not bother you, then there's a lot to like about Terreria. As it stands, however, I cannot in good faith say that I enjoyed my time with the game.
7652	0	a	I would pay money for this game to not show up in my games list
7653	0	a	Its just so boring. And I like walking around getting loot, mining, crafting, et al. Cant understand why this is so highly rated. Had Steam offered refunds when I originally purchased I wouldve gotten one immediately.
7654	0	a	this game is autistic as heck, it's really bad, please don't buy this game.
7655	0	a	Boring piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 2dimensional Minecraft.
7656	0	a	I think this really needs to be played with friends to be enjoyed. A bit too open world for me with little guidence and I felt like I was making no progress at all. Felt very repetitive and grindy as well.
7657	0	a	The game is alright, but it's a little boring for me. I don't feel like doing a multiplayer because I don't make a server for a friend.  I don't know what I wanted to do on Singleplayer. So yeah
7658	0	a	About as boring as minecraft except its 2D  Same gameplay mechanics as minecraft Same sprite based look like minecraft Same boring as minecraft.
7659	0	a	Any sort of hosting or playing on a multiplayer server is enraging
7660	0	a	I bought Terraria the day it was released. I was really into Minecraft so this was the next best thing. Terraria is really good - just not for me. The controls always felt wonky to me, and the universe is made up of a giant mess of different styles. They mix in everything from sci-fi alien guns to magic to basic primitive crafting and castles. It comes off weird.   Look, there is LOTS of game to be had here, I just don't like side-scrolling crafting games. I have also heard this being called a MetroidVania - which I assure you, it is not. There is not much of a storyline here.  Music is really good.

7671	0	a	I bought this to play it with my friend because he recommended it and we were able to play it together the first day. The next day I got on to play with him again and it just sat there loading and never connected. I would recommend this game if your interested in a fun game to play alone but if your getting it to play with a friend then its not worth the time or frustration.
7672	0	a	To all the Game Developers who are making Terraria, I'd like to give my Honest opinion to this Horrible Game. Kudos to the Character Customisation, a 1/10 for my liking, however, I was playing with my Loving and Kind friends until I died every 5 seconds by Trees, Dogs and even Parrots. This Game is a Disgrace to Steam and should be Banned. Don't let this Minecraft-Copied game enter your lives, It will create Havoc to your Wonderful Lives. Definitely not worth paying $10 for.
7673	0	a	Thought this would be better than Minecraft. It is not. Bought a 4-Pack and didn't even give the last one.
7674	0	a	I just dont understand. What is the appeal of this game? You dont like all the freedom and user friendly interface of minecraft? You hate knowing what anything does? You hate playing with other people?  So i created a character and a world and poped in to start a play session. There was a guy walking around an some pots to my right. Video game insticts kicked in and I started destroying pots and getting stuff. From the moment I started the game there was a slow stream of slimes coming from the left side of the screen that I had to deal with. I press every button to figure out how to get to my inventory before just giving up. Then I hit escape and realize my inventory opens. What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? Why did they think that was a good idea?? It also acts as the options screen as there is a small settings button in the bottom right corner that you probobly wont notice.  So I started looking at all the stuff from the pots when I started thinking, 'What am I supposed to be doing here?' I walked up to the guy that was walking around figuring he was there for a reason. After 5 minutes of fumbling around with him I figured out right click is the interaction button! Come to find out this guy is the tutorial. He has a handful of short messages that I guess are supposed to help you know what to do. Before I could finish reading all his stuff night came and a metric ton of floating eyes and zombies swarmed on me. You do so little damage to them and they kill you very very quickly. The eyes are also very hard to hit. So for about 15 minutes I would spawn, and die over and over until day came.  Then I decided to build a house. A staple for these types of game you would think. And thats when I realized. 'What the hell can you do with a 2d house? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all is the answer to that question. After fighting with the interface to build a simple house I decided to start mining to see what I could get. The sprites are so small compared to you that it becomes frustrating to click all of the tiny crap so you can mine. Not to mention its hard to gauge the depth you are digging for stairs. In minecraft you know to dig 1 down because you can only jump 1 block high. Here however, you have no idea. My stairs ended up looking all deformed and messed up because screw trying to count each little sprite.  I then made a crafting table to try and craft something. I put one down and right click on it an nothing happens. After a while of fumbling about again I realize that you just stand next to it and the recipes show up in the player inventory screen. I just dont understand how people find this game entertaining in the least bit. Maybe they have never heard of minecraft?  After the crafting fun I start digging some more. A slime drops out of nowhere on my head and kills me.  I cant even bother trying this game again. It may get better after a few hundred hours and reading a bunch of guides but who the hell would want to do that? Ill just keep building massive cities and castles and going to the moon and messing with crazy mods in minecraft.
7675	0	a	Its like minecraft, but 10x worse, don't recommend what so ever
7676	0	a	Nope ....  This game is boring
7677	0	a	A game which is not in early access should not crash all the time after this 'new awesome update', before it was an awesome game though
7678	0	a	Easily one of the most boring experiences I've had and is very close to the worst game in my library.  The invintory is the bulkiest, most in the way, trash I've seen in a game. It doesn't go away either. The controls are so clunky that the closest thing I can compare them to is something out of the NES shovelware library or the dollar store electronic games section. All that content people like to talk about? You won't get to see any of that unless you've got days to spend swinging your starter pick at the most obnoxiously sized dirt/stone blocks.  And when I say the blocks are obnoxiously sized I mean it. Once you've mastered the moronic controls you will very quickly realize that single blocks are your biggest enemy.  So if you hate other parts of a game getting in the way of playing a game, don't like spending hours and hours looking at an ugly little man banging away at square turds for hours and hour for literally no gain whatsoever, and like it when your enemies don't extend past set pieces then save your time and money because this game has every one of those.
7679	0	a	  this game really sucks to be honest... I'm glad I picked it up for only $2 USD. This game is similar to minecraft but it's 2D and it has wayyy more things than minecraft.... well sorta.... I'd rather play minecraft then this piece of sh!t even tho I hate both.... This game is good for killing time.... It's so boring tho and so bad.... so many people say this game is a great sandbox and it is but it's just not what I expected.... It's really fake and hard when you come across one of those slime or zombie fu-ckers..... If you have like $20 in your steam accounts then just go ahead and buy terraria when it's on sale, but please don't buy it at full price..... But if your limited on money and your games then don't even bother with this game.... I honestly don't like it, overall I give this game a rating of   10/10...........Billion.

You hate playing with other people?  So i created a character and a world and poped in to start a play session. There was a guy walking around an some pots to my right. Video game insticts kicked in and I started destroying pots and getting stuff. From the moment I started the game there was a slow stream of slimes coming from the left side of the screen that I had to deal with. I press every button to figure out how to get to my inventory before just giving up. Then I hit escape and realize my inventory opens. What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? Why did they think that was a good idea?? It also acts as the options screen as there is a small settings button in the bottom right corner that you probobly wont notice.  So I started looking at all the stuff from the pots when I started thinking, 'What am I supposed to be doing here?' I walked up to the guy that was walking around figuring he was there for a reason. After 5 minutes of fumbling around with him I figured out right click is the interaction button! Come to find out this guy is the tutorial. He has a handful of short messages that I guess are supposed to help you know what to do. Before I could finish reading all his stuff night came and a metric ton of floating eyes and zombies swarmed on me. You do so little damage to them and they kill you very very quickly. The eyes are also very hard to hit. So for about 15 minutes I would spawn, and die over and over until day came.  Then I decided to build a house. A staple for these types of game you would think. And thats when I realized. 'What the hell can you do with a 2d house? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all is the answer to that question. After fighting with the interface to build a simple house I decided to start mining to see what I could get. The sprites are so small compared to you that it becomes frustrating to click all of the tiny crap so you can mine. Not to mention its hard to gauge the depth you are digging for stairs. In minecraft you know to dig 1 down because you can only jump 1 block high. Here however, you have no idea. My stairs ended up looking all deformed and messed up because screw trying to count each little sprite.  I then made a crafting table to try and craft something. I put one down and right click on it an nothing happens. After a while of fumbling about again I realize that you just stand next to it and the recipes show up in the player inventory screen. I just dont understand how people find this game entertaining in the least bit. Maybe they have never heard of minecraft?  After the crafting fun I start digging some more. A slime drops out of nowhere on my head and kills me.  I cant even bother trying this game again. It may get better after a few hundred hours and reading a bunch of guides but who the hell would want to do that? Ill just keep building massive cities and castles and going to the moon and messing with crazy mods in minecraft.
7684	0	a	The game is supposedly quite fun to play with friends. All my friends have already stopped playing before I got a chance to try it. As a solo experience, I find that the game does a bad job introducing the game to you. I've tried to get into this game several different times on various different platforms but it has never managed to spark my interest.
7685	0	a	Its like minecraft, but 10x worse, don't recommend what so ever
7686	0	a	Boring, uninteresting, and downright confusing. These are only a few of the words I would use to describe the horrible and short experience that I had with this game. If you can figure out the awful crafting system, even then the game has nothing new or interesting to offer. Combat is terrible, crafting is like trying to steer a charging rhino, and the entertainment value could not be lower. I regret buying it everytime I see it in my library.
7687	0	a	i need this for MAC!!!!!!
7688	0	a	A game which is not in early access should not crash all the time after this 'new awesome update', before it was an awesome game though
7689	0	a	I had more fun shaving my grandfather's back this morning than I did playing this stupid game. I really tried enjoying it but all I did was DIE DIE DIE!!! If being slain by demon eyes and buzzards over and over again because the only weapons provided for you are a pick axe, useless dagger, and a shovel that take out 1 point damage every 10 hits, then by all means, play the game! But I would not waste my time if I were you.
7690	0	a	I found a pink slime once. I thought it was just a normal slime, some hits and its down. It ended up killing me. You shouldn't play this game unless the most cute and innocent-looking slime should kill you.
7691	0	a	Keeps crashing, can't even play with the 1.3 update.
7692	0	a	The developer already has my time and money, but I would get my money back if I could. The fact that it's 2015 and the game is hard limited to 1080p is insane. No other game I launch has this limitation, because it's stupid and has no reason to exist.  This developer is basically a bag of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, with some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the floor. Buy this game if you support developers who smell like a bag of old â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
7693	0	a	game like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,even worse than mountain
7694	0	a	this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game it giltches out and i lost my character
7695	0	a	Terraria... yeah... it was ok... until Starbound came out... now it kinda sucks... 30/100
7696	0	a	Possible Waste of time and computer space. I couldn't even open it before it crashed. Help?
7697	0	a	It's a great game. Really. Sadly, i wasted money on it, thinking my buddies and I would get together and play every week or so, but it's just not one of those games. If you're hardcore you can go maybe 2-3 hours back to back doing singleplayer, but I would'nt recommend that either. If you want it, go for it. If you're still unsure, just don't. You can use that $10-$15 later.
7698	0	a	Minecraft but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... If you want to play this, just install a Terraria mod to MC, same for Starbound.

7708	0	a	Boring.Like really boring.  
7709	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for all reasons 
7710	0	a	Not for everybody.
7711	0	a	To be honest, I'm not recommending this game based on my own likes of games. This game has nothing inherently wrong with it other than, if you're playing with friends, you can blow through everything the game has to offer in less than a week of playing for maybe 4 hour stretches of time. Some people consider that a good thing.   This game just isn't the style of game I like. That's completely my problem though. The game isn't bad, just not my style.
7712	0	a	The sad part is I read the reviews way before buying this game and the negative reviews were still positive messages. This will leave you with Misinformation and is really unfair for the consumer, so let me give you my real, albeit negative, opinion.  I started a few days ago and as impressed as I was, I now am just irritated with it's tediousness. If you enjoy Minecraft, mainly for it's creative fun, this is NOT the game for you can't just have fun with it, you must spend hundreds of hours to get a great stash and repeat hours and hours of stuff to complete a collection that transfers between worlds. I literaly had someone babysit me to teach me how to play because it was too immense. I spent 4 hours just building a bridge for the Wall of Flesh today and I don't intend on ever doing it again. The Wall of Flesh is a really mean boss at the bottom of the map who moves towards you and you cannot escape him, and to summon him was completely unkown until I asked for help. And after beating this wall of flesh, my house was destroyed because the game jumped into Hardmode and the starting night was an even that spawns enemies like crazy and when I got back home, it was over-taken by powerful and hardy creatures who killed a ton of NPCs. Minecraft may not hold your hand at all, but this game has a lot of nasty first-timer tricks and cruel jokes, suchas Ore that damages you or even spawns lava when it's mined.  If you're a creative person but can handle adventuring and long hours spent mining and farming, than this game for you, if you just want to design castles and dungeons, stay away, there is no creative/cheat mode for you here.
7713	0	a	Gave a try to Terraria as it was in the humble bundle and i wanted to know what the fuss was about - contrary to what the apologists say it is indeed a poor man's Minecraft. Same OC gameplay but with more timesinks, without the 3rd dimension which allows to construct actually interesting buildings and without code injection tools masked as levers and switches.  I do have a problem with figuring out the draw here. It boasts three million copies sold yet it's a game without a proper goal, with the building component rather lacking, some bad RPG-like progression mechanics; the aesthetics are nice but the style's now overused and has got the 'indie game with pixels #12' label all over it.   It's a constant grind that, compared to Minecraft, doesn't even reward you with the option of building something cool that you can post on the internets. I'm not a fan of Minecraft either so I completely understand that I'm not really the kind of gamer Terraria is supposed to appeal to. Would give it a neutral review but Steam doesn't allow it.  My suggestion is - if you're not a fan of Minecraft you're likely to appreciate Terraria even less so steer clear.
7714	0	a	I personally found the late game to be completely unenjoyable in Terraria, even when playing with a friend. There are simply too many items to keep track of and obtain let alone intuitively combine into new ones. The same happens with the combat, as an abundance of choice and general clunkyness made the game too frustrating to finish.  I'm told they're still adding content to the game to which my reply is the game does not need more content and it is obsessed with quantity over quality. If you do want to finish it I hope you like alt-tabbing to guides a lot.
7715	0	a	The start is just ridiculous. Way too many monsters with stupidly unbalanced power compared to player, and no reasonable tutorial makes this a death fest that in no way encourages people new to the genre to pick it up and enjoy.  Crafting is confusing, placing of objects is way too hard, UI is a mess. I gave up after two hours of chain dying on or near the spawn point. I guess I'll just wait for the stable upgrade for Starbound...   EDIT (to expand on previous and respond to some comments):  Chain dying is not the fun part for me, others may think differently. The fun part for me comes after you've checked the wiki pages, learned the basic ropes (no thanks to the game!). Then, and only then can you start incrementally learning how different things work. Repeatedly dying at the spawn point only teaches you to build a 'shed' at the spawn point. By that time I was getting 3-4 mobs at a time + one flying creature, and with the starter weapon there is no way to survive such attack waves.  Guess how the Starting Guide for Terraria (in the official? wiki) starts?  'If you're here then chances are you've begun playing and have wondered what you're supposed to be doing (and perhaps how to keep from dying).' I wonder where they got that from? Could it be that the game simply starts in a way that is way too brutal for those who simply have no idea what to do? Compare to eg. Starbound where you spawn at the ship when you die, so you can actually try to learn the interface without being constantly attacked by mobs. Where the quests teach you the basics incrementally, and leave the rest to be discovered.  I'm sure once people get the hang of it, Terraria becomes a fun sandbox. However, as I said, the start is too harsh, too unforgiving, and too difficult to approach without extra help. I guess I should have looked for a manual, and then read that to know everything there is to know.  Regardless of the dying aspect, the crafting interface is confusing: which part is the source, how many will be crafted, do I need to be close to the table, is the crafting menu context sensitive or not, what materials did I need for what, what can I actually craft, why would I want to craft something...  Placing of objects was simply ridiculous: even though I knew I wanted a door, and had a correct sized opening for it, getting the door into place seemed next to impossible. The best approach seemed to be to just wildly move the mouse pointer in the general area of where the door should be placed and hope for the best. Again, compare to Starbound where you simply place the cursor roughly in the correct place and the door snaps in place without sub-pixel placement requirements. The problems with door placement seemed to be present with table placement, camp fire placement, ...  As for UI being a mess, I meant that literally. Opening a chest places so much text on the screen as to make most of it unreadable as it overlaps the player's inventory text.  I'm sure there is a great game down there somewhere, but if the game is by design harsh for the first timers, then I'm glad to leave it to those who appreciate that sort of thing. I'd rather play something where I don't have to fight user interface idiocies or be killed repeatedly simply because the developers thought that would be fun. Luckily, there is no shortage of great quality games where the challenge is not the interface, and where I'm not punished for not already knowing everything there is to know about the game *before* I've even started.  Nevertheless, I want to thank all the commenters for their helpful insights, and their compassion. It's nice to know that those who can get past the rough start have a great community to play with.

7717	0	a	I'm a huge fan of Minecraft. I love 2D games as well. I thought I would love this. I just... didn't. I just could'nt get into it. I tried guys I really did, I'm sorry.

7719	0	a	after you get all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you wanted, it quickly becomes 'now what?' sure you can build â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ everywhere but whats the point? im not the type that is going to try and make something great just to impress people i don't even know.   also the pvp is just garbage, even if you find a good challenge the fight is just lame anyway. This game really wasn't made for that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to begin with.  i actually enjoyed the game at the very start where i had to be careful at every step but now with a powerful character i don't care about anything anymore including the game itself.
7720	0	a	do not download this game uner any circumstances, you will lose loved ones, you will lose pets, you will lose family members, income and the possibility of ever seeing the actual sun again. terraria becomes everything, it is all consuming and all knowing... the only reason to ever stop playing is so it can update.
7721	0	a	I find this game to be a tad on the boring side and a bit hard to pick up and play. I've had it for over a year and have never been able to commit myself to sitting down and playing it for more than 5 minutes at a time.  Overall, its a well-made game, but I find it rather bland. Starbound is way better if you're looking for a sidescolling minecraftlike.
7722	0	a	I did not do a lot research before buying this game. I saw the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' status and just assumed it was a great game. I started playing it and I got that Mincrafty feeling. I was expecting more of a puzzle platformer than a sandbox game. The game is too open ended and that makes it boring.
7723	0	a	It is a well done game but gets boring really quickly after you've done most of the things this game has to offer. I will not recommend this because only the first hours are fun, the next hours you would've got used to everything and yeah, have nothing to do. Plus the worlds are tiny, even when on the largest size, they aren't really big.  -I am not comparing this to Minecraft, as Minecraft sucks even more, and Terraria is a whole different game.-
7724	0	a	Play Length: Very brief. This is just an impression of the game, so take it with a grain of salt.  Positives: Some of the things I like about Minecraft, I like about this game. I like the lighting system, I like the feeling of exploring a deep cave and harvesting resources.   Negatives: I could call this game a rip-off of Minecraft, but that wouldn't be very constructive. Actually, a 2D version of Minecraft is an idea with a lot of potential. So let me talk about why I think Terraria doesn't harness this potential, and ultimately doesn't work.  For me, the biggest appeal of Minecraft is the idea of being able to freely alter a 3D environment. The fact that you can dig into the ground, and that your very exploration is shaping the earth around you... the idea that you can take the rescources you find and freely shape them into 3D structures. If Minecraft were just legos, that alone would be ground-breaking. But Minecraft is more than just legos, it's also an adventure and exploration game, and allows you to carve out a place in your own world.  The key to why this is so cool is the fact that Minecraft is in 3D. So the fact that Terraria is in 2D really neuters a lot of what makes Minecraft cool. It's not nearly as interesting to build structures in 2D. It's not nearly as interesting to carve out a cave in a 2D plane as you explore. But that's not to say that Terraria couldn't work well as a game... it just needed to find it's own path. And Terraria does try to be different... unfortunately, it mainly does so through combat. Terraria features a greater variety of monsters and bosses, much greater than Minecraft. The reason why this doesn't work well is because combat in Terraria is not particularly well refined. Combat was always the weakest aspect of Minecraft, and that carries over to Terraria. So placing a greater emphasis on this element seems like a mistake.   There's other things that bother me about Terraria. Graphics were never Minecraft's strong suit, but that's because the nature of the game engine necessitated simplistic graphics. That is not so for Terraria, and yet the graphics are still so rudimentary. I'm not asking for realism, but there is a real lack of charm to the art style that would have really helped the feel of the game.   The soundtrack is actually pretty decent. But nothing special. I think Minecraft's music is much better for this style of game... I love how it leaves you in silence most of the time, but every so often some beautiful music comes down from the heavens to accentuate what you're doing. It works amazingly well. Terraria's constant music doesn't work quite as well. This is one area where they actually probably should have copied Minecraft a bit more closely. Which is not to say that the music is bad, but it could have definitely been much better.  Overall: I can kind of see why some people like this game. But for me, the concept of a 2D Minecraft is still very untapped. Terraria borrows (or steals, depending on your slant) a lot from Minecraft, but it leaves behind the essence of what makes Minecraft an amazing game, without compensating with anything special of it's own.  About my rating system: I have two things I rate on. Overall score, and soundtrack. Personally, I feel like game soundtracks are tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a vital factor in getting me into the game. For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and equal importance. The meaning of each number are as follows:  0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: Masterpiece  Terraria's score:  Game Rating: 4 (Mediocre) Soundtrack Rating: 4 (Mediocre) 
7725	0	a	im sorry but out of all the games i have this is the most boring i cant stand this game theres so many games like it that are better i would never ever recommend this game to any one im sorry this is the truth i have this game trust me i know i really do hate it its all just rince and repeat. i have just put this here only to show my side of this game i wish i could retern it and get my money back i just really dont injoy its really not worth it for what it is. be sure to send me all the hate comments you want or if you agree with me make sure to let me know that u for taking the time to read this and have a nice day.

They left Terrarria and started work on their own game.  Starbound is like Terrarria but with an infinite amount of space and planets to explore as well as there being 100000x more things to do.  On it's own, I rate this game a 6/10. Its okay. Just barely above average when it comes to block-building games.

7740	0	a	Important: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Gamerbros will hate and demean you for disliking the game.   Hardmode absolutely brutalizes new players with things they couldn't possibly anticipate and mobs that are stronger than most bosses you fought until that point. Oh and around that time randomly bosses spawn and kill you in your own base. So you can't even bunker yourself in during dangerous times like in Minecraft. Day/Night, there is enough that can kill you in a few hits in HM.  Unless you have a friend who can pull you through most of HM, prepare for a game that makes you wish you were playing Dark Souls instead.

7745	0	a	It had been forever since I'd played this game, and I just happened to see Sips streaming it, and it just got me in the mood to play some Terraria, remember all the fun I used to have, so I loaded the game up, went for some chieves, and it was just what I needed... to realize yet again why I like Starbound so much more, Terraria's got it's whole fluidity of completion, by which I mean, it's not as WIP as something like Starbound, but somehow it manages to be far worse.  Comparison between Terraria and Starbound: Prices T: $9.99 S: $14.99 Sure, Terraria's cheaper, but not by enough to make it favorable for that reason, but I do have to give it a point for pricing.  Gameplay: T: Terraria's gameplay is classic... for it's time. It was THE 2D sandbox game when it was popular, but now it's been vastly improved upon, making Terraria's mechanics somewhat outdated in comparrison, it's got the good ole' tested and true 'you just got dropped on your â™¥â™¥â™¥ into a world you don't know, good luck' feature, and that's fun at first, but it gets old pretty fast, what sets Terraria apart here is your first homeless pal; the guide. That guy's there to help you on your way, and more NPCs to come once you do build a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Super 8 motel. The next thing about the gameplay other than your classic sandbox survival is that it has many various summonable bosses, and the world levels around you into the hallowed version, then you win and it's all been there done that, it has low replayability, or it WOULD per say, if you weren't able to go to a new world through, uh, the sheer meta-ness of it. With that feature you can go everywhere and see everything as much as you want. S: Starbound at first seems kinda like a rip of Terraria, 'your classic 2D sandbox survival, yada yada' until you actually make your character (more on that later though) and spawn in and realize hey, where is the world, and more importantly, where am I now? That's right, Starbound breaks the mold here and gets you into the world in a different way. At first you are on your absolutely wrecked spaceship, with nothing to go by but a few animated sprites on the wall for you to interact with, and well, a door, and that's all you see in your first moments, so naturally, you look for what you're menat to do, and end up finding the ship's AI, and it walks you through just a bit of where you're going to be getting started, it enables your matter manipulator, and your teleporter, and then it gives you an objective and you're off, you are finally dropped into your first world. So after your generic survival sandbox stuff, you find yourself completing more quests for your AI and realizing oh, wait, I'm on a space-ship, I can go to another world if I want! Opening up (eventually) the space exploration aspect of the game, which lets you progress even further until the point you gte some items for bosses, seeing some naturally generated structures, and even getting to the next tier of planet, and getting more ans stronger materials. It's overall pretty vast, and exploration heavy.  Modding capability T: OMFG dont even get me started, Terraria's modding community has never been spectacular, from what I've seen anyways, and the way the update was so random, no mods were updated yet, not that I expect that would have made this much better. S: Starbound's modding community is EXPLOSIVE, new races, new gameplay mechanics, new generation features, and more, every catagory seems to have mods waiting to be tried out in SCORES, it's honestly spectacular, and the community for Starbound's mods might even rival Minecraft or skyrim at some point, the community is ripe with this one! And that's me almost forgetting to mention that mods are easier to install on Starbound.  Character Creation: T: Terraria's character creation is really bland, and a bit difficult to navigate, the best thing about it is the ability to fiddle with the colors with variety, but that said, not ease. S: Starbound's character creation is better overall from point A: Race/Species You have a total of six vanilla races to choose from, and tons more from the modding community, the color options are more limited, but again the modding community comes in to help this, but I will admit it isn't 100% resolved. you can customize what you're character's starting clothes are, what they look like, even the pose they stand still in.  Honestly, if it comes down to it, don't get this game, save up the other five bucks to afford Starbound instead.

7780	0	a	I'm just gonna come out and say it. I don't like this game.  It's not a bad game, but it's not my type of game. It's 2D scale Minecraft and I never really held a love for Minecraft being killed by wolves within 5 minutes of starting the game. I can't recommend it for non-Minecraft fans, but if you like Minecraft, this is the equivalent on a smaller scale.  Is it a bad game? No. Is a good game? Most likely, I haven't played far into it. Is it a game that I like? No.
7781	0	a	STOP GOING ON SALE! THERE ARE BETTER GAMES THAT CAN BE ON SALE; EVERYONE OWNS YOU ALREADY!
7782	0	a	Terraria is a good game, and a fun 2-D side scroller, full of mobs, and collectible items. As a game it is great. For those who enjoy this type of game, this and starbound are great additions to your game librarys.  Yet for entertainment I feel it just lacked the fun element FOR ME, as I just never understood it and thus couldn't enjoy it, that's why I do not recommend it.
7783	0	a	I didn't enjoy my time playing the game. I've spent more than the couple of hours listed on steam, as I've played it off of Steam, and am probably closer to somewhere around 10 or 20 hours total.  There is no goal to the game, besides exploration and getting stronger, which I struggle to find fulfilling. Part of the problem was how I started playing the game - playing with friends who had already gotten as strong as feasibly possible. That sucked the fun out of it for me, and I've never been able to get it back. Most of my time playing was spent hiding away from the strong monsters my friends had spawned, only able to hang around to participate in conversations.  Many others seem to enjoy it, but I do not. Maybe this should be taken as a warning to be careful how you approach the game and who you play with, but I personally don't recommend the game at all.  That, and the art is really... enh.
7784	0	a	Imagine a giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ flying towards your mouth, and there's nothing you can do about it. And you're like 'Oh man, I'm gonna have to suck this thing', and you brace yourself to suck this giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But then, at the last moment, it changes trajectory and hits you in the eye. You think to yourself 'Well, at least I got that out of the way', but then the giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ rears back and stabs your eye again, and again, and again. Eventually, this giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is penetrating your gray matter, and you begin to lose control of your motor skills. That's when the giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ slaps you across the cheek, causing you to fall out of your chair. Unable to move and at your most vulnerable, the giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ finally lodges itself in your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, where it rests uncomfortably for 4, maybe 5 hours. That's what Terraria is like.
7785	0	a	It feels like everyone but me loves this game. To me, it felt like a flash game that was suddenly for sale on steam. Maybe my opinion was tainted when the beta just used recolored final fantasy sprites for everything. I had a bit of fun with it at first, and then quickly became very very bored. Building a city- checking the wiki constantly to try to make villagers show up in it, mining out so far from your city that it takes forever to get back and forth, trying to figure out why a perfectly well lit sealed room in your city is suddenly full of monsters, all good times.  Maybe if I'd gotten past the first five or six hours I'd have a different opinion, as the promotional videos all look much more exciting than my experience, but I suppose showing the week spent digging holes for rocks to make stuff with wouldn't look as fun.
7786	0	a	How the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ did I play 67 hours of this. Help me please.
7787	0	a	You see, I have an odd relationship with this game. It was very fun at first (playing with friends in multiplayer, I can't stand single player) but it got old fairly fast. I found myself beating the game, getting bored and not playing until the next update, rinse and repeat. I feel this game is worth it when it's on sale, but I honestly cannot recommend this at it's full price. Maybe this is just me, and others will have a different experience, but I would advise holding off on buying unless it's on sale.  In conclusion, this game (for me) can be great fun, but ultimately has little replayability and can be beaten (Every boss) in about 10 hours.  Thanks for reading my review, and I hope someone can give me a reason to get back into the game, but I won't be playing it anymore if not.  (Sorry for my terrible formatting, this is one of 3 reviews I have written)
7788	0	a	IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS VISTA DON'T PURCHASE THIS GAME! I tried buying the game earlier, and if you have Windows Vista(A.K.A - The worst of all the windows products) it will not work! You cannot download several things you need in order to make the game run. I've never expirenced such a disapointment in my life. I got no support/help, I had to learn the hard way, and I cannot get my money back. If I'm wrong, someone please tell me how to fix this!
7789	0	a	With everyone else praising this game for everything it does its a rarity that someone critizies it. I can't say that I go for this game much, its the familiar setting of a mystical world filled with vicious creatures that want no more than to eat your insides while forcing you to watch, and thats great, however trying to present this in a 2D view is not ideal.  The enemies are easy to kill once you know how to do it and the items you can craft (tables, chairs, bowls. etc.) have no purpose other than to waste your resources.  Although this is supposed to be a (dare I say it) minecraft clone it centres on co-operative playing and helping one another out, when playing single player you sit there in a house made of stone and just wait, thats it, theres nothing more to this game when playing it alone. On the other hand when you're with others you build a castle, putting everyones collected resources into the building, you fill it with bowls and chairs and tables and then you basically just sit there in the castle and wait.  For the 2.5 hours of mind numbing boredom I endured with this game I would not pay more than what I did (Â£0.84) and I wouldn't advise any one else to.
7790	0	a	A game that requires me to watch tutorials and read the wiki page right off the bat is not a well made game. This game was recommended to me by a lot of friends, knowing me and my love for Minecraft they assumed it would be a great game for me to try. Not sorry to say, but I didn't like it. The UI is terrible, you have to craft an 'approved' house is silly, most of my time spent on this game was looking up what the hell I needed to do or craft... even how to build a house. Something so simple turned out to be a major headache. I'll eventually give this game another try when the bitter taste in my mouth from my dislike and frustration for this game is gone.
7791	0	a	This game is fun for 3 days, then you realize you've already done everything there is to do, been to the farthest left you can go and the farthest right. After you do that, shortly you'll collect all the gadgets have the highest tier set of armor and the realize 'wow, there is nothing more to do...'    No replay value whatsoever. Combat is awful when comparative to any other sandbox game like this. You'll lose every drive you had to play this game after a time peroid literally less than 3 days. This game is not hard to play, it's not fun afterwards, and you will be amazed at how quick you lose all interest in this game once you get the highest tier of armor on your first character. Unless you think you have fun doing the same thing over and over again, it's not worth it. Don't waste your time on this game, you will be so dissapointed in the end.   To add to Terraria's vast sea of negative features the multiplayer in this game is also pitiful. It takes ages to load worlds and maps, and half the time it crashes. It's only connection VIA IP, no servers. (though not a big deal on that one) and once you do get in a server connection issues are evident and just as unavoidable as smashing waves in high tide. And these waves will leave your sandcastle in ruin. Don't think you'll be able to easily play with your friends, because you won't. Connection issues will stop you. Game is easy to play through solo but rather hard to connect with friends and stay in a server long enough to have fun. If you are buying this game to play with your friends, simply buy another game. Wasting your time on Terraria's pathetic multiplayer will prove to be fruitless.  Want a simmilar game that you can get a lot more hours out of with better gameplay, combat, even storyline... and loads of customization along with randomized PLANETS instead of just randomized BIOMES... space travel, and 4 different races?  Try Starbound.
7792	0	a	Not sure why but this game bores me and quickly.
7793	0	a	I just couldn't get into it. the deeper I went, the more it seemed like I wasn't getting anything done in the game. depth is usually a good thing, but when I need 10 hours of grinding to make the slightest progress, I lose interest.
7794	0	a	Don't get me wrong.. This is a great game. Its polished and basically bug free. There is a ton of content in this game and plenty of places to explore, discover and fight.. But what makes this game undesirable for me is the Micromanaging.. When you start getting a stock pile things.. it becomes very tedious to organizing items and you start to get bored once you acquire the higher tier gear.
7795	0	a	As of right now, the game is unaccessible for many people including myself, if this is fixed then I would fully reccomend this game.
7796	0	a	As much as I LOVED this game for the first 20 hours with friends, I gets quite repetitive. I joined a random server where a guy filled my inventory with a bunch random crap. I went to me and my friends home world and too my suprise the stuff the guy gave me was in my inventory. At first I thought it was a glitch but after learning you can join a random server and get lot to transport to your world I saw that as a horrible idea. I finally realized where all the good stuff my friends where finding was coming from. This game is ok but can use some fixings.
7797	0	a	Run around and upgrade stuff, that's about it. Building is diffacult at best, and at times fustrating.  I am also not a fan of the 2d 8-bit like graphics. Also, one seems to end up running around for hours trying to find the one thing they need to craft the best items.

7800	0	a	This game had me hooked for a while, but I sadly stopped playing it. It seems that the developers don't care about this game anymore. I've lost all interest in playing it as there is nothing left for me to do in it. When you do buy it, be prepared to one day never play it again.

7803	0	a	Now that the game actually works for 20 minutes at a time without crashing, I can render my true and informed opinion: I just don't find this game to be especially fun. The simplicity - the monotony, even - of its central game mechanic belies the complexity of the progression, on which matter the game itself offers no guidance. Scurrying back and forth to the wiki for reference is an irritation that has no part in a satisfying game.  Though combat was initially intriguing and satisfying, with some truly excellent sound design, the same limited control scheme that makes Terraria simple to learn simultaneously makes it trivial to master. As I understand it, in the endgame a wider variety of ranged weapons with unique utilities become available, but I have no desire to put in the dozens of hours it will take to get there.  Terraria is a game with a huge amount of content to explore. Unfortunately, exploring that content and reaping the rewards of extended play is tedious and extremely time-intensive. Furthermore, the unstructured nature of the sandbox makes it difficult to maintain any sense of purpose, momentum, or direction. Alone in a hostile, static world, I just feel crushed by the pointlessness of it all - though perhaps it's my own fault that I give in so easily to electronic nihilism. Perhaps sandboxes are just no longer my cup of tea.
7804	0	a	For whatever reason i could never get into terraria i even had trouble getting into this review. But my friends seem to like it so i guess it cant be that bad
7805	0	a	Many people will enjoy this game, since it offers many things Minecraft doesnt, however i was none of them. This has several reasons: * The graphics and the UI are bad. I could still live with the graphics, but i have never seen such a bad interface in my entire life! * I found the controls extremely unintuitive. This game feels like a platformer, just on an extreme scale, and i dont think PC is the right platform for that. I really had serious problems moving and fighting properly * There is no help for newcomers. I hate it to have to watch a couple of tutorial videos, just to know what i can and should do * Variety is very small. There is no campaign or story, (which you'll find and enjoy in other sandbox games like Craft the World, Planet Explorers), just endless play, and no character developement... * The translation is bad. Noticeable parts of the text havent been translated at all, or only sloppy * Crafting is a bit of a mess, since you need to stand in front of a production structure, to be able to use it. Additionaly, only those crafting receipies are shown, which can be crafted with the current ingredients in the inventory. Regarding that there are lots of different production structures, and that the inventory is small, this really gets annoying  Still, if you think you can live with all that, get it and you wont be disappointed...
7806	0	a	Many people liken this game to Minecraft. Personally, I find that freakin' hilarious. Kinda like when people compare a Lexus to a Saab, or meatballs to pizza. This game, TOTALLY unlike Minecraft, does NOT potentially consume half your harddrive with saves, map-files and other worthless, rÃ«tardedly coded java-trash, which is possibly its only redeeming feature. And likewise, it gives you about as much content as it requires harddrive space, which renders THAT feature worthless. Sure, you can go down underground and search for random crap that'll basically just further emphasise what a worthless, pathetic excuse for a gear-whÃ¶re that you really are.  SUUUUURE you can try 'building' things. But does it really matter? Your NPC's sure as hell ain't gonna thank you for letting them live in a luxurious mansion instead of a crappy shanty. So, basically... this game is plain dumb and boring. That and the characters are all ugly as hell. 1.8/10

7810	0	a	At first I was drawn into the game by the cute graphics that reminded me of the old SNES days, the very cheap price and two of my other friends owning it (But one just had it gifted to them and didn't want it). After some playing through the single-player portion (And a run-in with a very toxic and hostile online group, L6D's Community Server), this game just is not very fun. Not much direction on what to do in the single-player mode, and joining a new community puts you in a killzone where you are forced to be slaughtered four dozen times while community members tell you to go slit your wrists in real life.  I've came across some games before, that focus more on multi-player than single-player. That, to fully experience them, you have to play among friends or play online. Terraria is clearly one of those games.  Just it is not a very fun game. The only benefit is I spent only 2 bucks on this.
7811	0	a	Can't say I'd recommend, but it's fun from time to time.
7812	0	a	Quite the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, I'm afraid. Decent for spending some lulzy old school, nostalgiafag time with friends. Not everyone's cup of tea. Especially not those who aren't into tedious menial tasks which end up feeling redundantly more challenging at higher levels. Or those utterly lacking a sense of direction; running out of clever ways to singlemindedly refuse getting stuck and dredge through to construct a virtual fantasy Peach's castle.
7813	0	a	I've purchased this game, my comp meets and exceeds system requirements, It crashes every time I try to open it, i have tried all the fixes me and my friends could think of with no progress, I have sent multiple e-mails to the support team with no response. I have played the game on a friend's comp and enjoy it but it is a waste of money to buy something that isn't supported in any way. Very Disappointed
7814	0	a	Worst $5 I've ever spent. Game has almost no originality or continuity. Game requires large amounts of outside research to understand and what's worse doesn't even make that journey fun. If this game interests you at all you'd be better of with Minecraft, Pixel Piracy, or Space Engineers. All games that have a great sandbox setup without all the things that ruin Terraria.
7815	0	a	DISCLAIMER: While it may seem I am a Minecraft fanboy, I am not. I dislike Minecraft more than I do this game, it's just Minecraft does what Terraria tries to do MUCH better.     It might have been that I went into this game with rather high expectations, but I did not have a very fun time with this game. The 2-D viewpoint, while charming at first, becomes a major annoyance after you begin to try and build things. Building things on a 2D world I instantly saw as difficult. While in Minecraft (which I will be comparing this game to a lot considering Terraria is essentially a 2D Minecraft clone.) it is easy and streamlined since you have all 3 dimensions. After building the best thing you can, a wooden box (not like you'd want to build anything more) you go to dig and find some minerals. Dear God where did I go so wrong. Digging in this game is horrendously difficult. In Minecraft I dig in a stairs sort of way so I don't fall into lava or down a steep drop. I assumed Terraria had random generated caves and whatnot as well, so I dug in a stair fashion. DO NOT EVER DO THAT. Since your character has some freakish way of not being able to move in certain spaces, causing digging down to be your only solution, causing you to inevitably fall to your death. After you manage to explore the bland 2D world, you aquire several various minerals. First thing you'll notice about the crafting menu is it's counter intuitive as balls. In most games where crafting is involved you get the recipes from the game itself. In games where you don't LIKE MINECRAFT, you get a set of boxes to mess around with and expiriment with. In Terraria you get a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who repeats the same couple of tips no matter how far you progress. SPEAKING OF PROGRESSION: there's no sense of it. This might just be me, but I get iron or something and make some tools. I then wander around aimlessly for 15 minutes and go play a good game like TF2. I feel no motivation to go and get more stuff. In Minecraft you can make your house interesting BECAUSE IT ISN'T IN THE FORMAT OF AN NES GAME. (Not to say this game is on par with masterpieces such as The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros 3) I feel as if I have no purpose in this game and when I go to explore I instantly get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by god knows what the hell it was. I have tried time and time again to explore the world to see if there's any redeeming qualities to this game but I continually die by the same mob. Maybe I just suck but I think that's a pretty big problem. The combat is boring, it consist of: hold A or D and click wherever the mob is. I bought this game a lot for the multiplayer, but they had to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that up too. I have the same problem with Minecraft multiplayer as I do with this game, THE SERVERS. You have to recite the Ukrainian pledge of allegiance (does Ukraine have one of those?) backwards 40 times then solve theoretical physics, WITHOUT letting the Combine come through some portal thing and make Earth gay, THEN you have to write an entire game in C++ if you want to host your own server. I know I'm exaggerating, but if I want to play this mediocre game with my friend, I don't want to have to make an exception for it in my modem and figure out what my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ port is or whatever. NO. I don't want to do that. I know if I read a Wikipedia article on the subject matter like 5 times I might be able to barely scrape by, but you know what? Why don't you just take Left 4 Dead 2 as an example and MAKE DEDICATED SERVERS. No one wants to have to fish through some website to find a server someone already made, where you have no free will. MAKE DEDICATED SERVERS.    Overall, I would not reccomend getting this game. The charm of it wears off quickly and whatever it had working for it eventually becomes clunky and annoying. This game has been overhyped by many sources. I give it a final rating of 4/10. What it borrows from Minecraft it ruins. If you want a fun Sandbox building game, get Minecraft.   If you disagree with me feel free to tell me why and try and sway my opinion otherwise.

7818	0	a	Its a sandbox that tried to create much the same model as minecraft. It was basically just a 2-d version. I praise terraria for its wide diversity of gameplay, but at the same time I just don't know if i can recommend it, because in their development of the game, they forgot what the genre of block/survival REALLY is about. And that is about beauty and creativity. Down the road of development they seem to have left that behind, and it dissapoints me.

7844	0	a	Buggy as anything else. Single player is great, but if you want to play with friends... There are no instructions on how to get your server running, or anything on how to join a server. They give you a .exe to run your server, but that doesn't do anything for you. Even with the correct IP address it wont sync with other players. No. I just wasted $10. :P
7845	0	a	horrible.
7846	0	a	CRAP GAME
7847	0	a	It's so boring. Yeah I said it fan boys!
7848	0	a	It's so boring. Yeah I said it fan boys!
7849	0	a	Well minecraft all over again but 2D well this sure sounds fun to me. I have never really liked 2D games and any game in general that have pixelated graphics like this.  3/10
7850	0	a	there are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in this game.
7851	0	a	This game is a well-programmed game, but needs to be a bit simpler. I suggest iPod for this game, not the PC version.
7852	0	a	gimme my money back this thing suck. i cant open doors. i got this for my birthday for 10 euro and its now 5!!!! if i just got 5 euro back then i would be happy.
7853	0	a	So, what do I think of this game?  First, it's one of the most confusing minecraft ripoffs I've played.  Second, it just sux balls.
7854	0	a	dad got angry for buying horrible game like this 
7855	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
7856	0	a	Don't do it man. Buy Minecraft or something
7857	0	a	A 2D game which may or may not be fun if you can get past the ugliest UI I have ever seen.
7858	0	a	2D battlefield, boring.
7859	0	a	It's like Minecraft (I assume.) in 2d. It feels really like addictive, and I'm the type of person who gets into those things. Ultimately the game is very shallow and kind of just relies on you to make it fun for yourself. I like to collect and horde things I think it just takes advantage of people with mindsets like that. I don't really recommend this game, because it's just so blah and bland. The combat is not deep at all, it really has nothing to offer me as a game player. I just found myself compulsively hording and farming for materials so I could make the tools I already had, but get a better version of the tool that does the job of the tool faster, and really the game boils down to that. Just use a trainer and have all the stuff, and realize you kind of just wasted your time.   The obvious counter argument to that I suppose is that all games are wastes of time, but to that I say waste your time more productively, heh.   Also, cheating in games is not really a moralistic thing as long as you're playing a single player game you can do whatever you want, if you don't have the time to farm ridiculous amounts of matierals just save yourself the time and effort. Play the game a little realize there is not much there but time sinks, and move on play something you enjoy or work on your personal life. Just cheat in this game if you have it, then do something with your time.
7860	0	a	I got this game a while back on sale for 2$. It would have been better spent at 7-11
7861	0	a	If you like this game i suggest you try Starbound.
7862	0	a	it doesn't work how it should be. only black overworld.
7863	0	a	Downloaded Terraria when I was on a survival kick, but wasn't all that impressed. I know this game isn't supposed to be visually impressive, but that's not why gave a thumbs down. To me, I never felt like exploring or crafting. The game didn't seem to entice me to keep playing (granted I've only played for 2 hours). I'll stick with Minecraft.
7864	0	a	TYLER, I DONT WANNA PLAY BLOCKLAND STFU.      we could play league tho tyler i want you`re money that you spent to buy me this game badly not worth

7881	0	a	I shouldn't have bought this game. Waste of 10$ It was reccomended to me, so i bought it and i thought is was going to be good. It was terrible, from my understanding it would have been a 'minecraft' type game. It was hard to understand. I would've rather spent my time looking for a game that is much better than this one.

I made to hell nothing but death everytime you die you have to run so far. god forbid you can rez or have somewhere closer to rez to nope nothing. the crafting sucks you can make alot of stuff but prepare to spend the rest of life farming for the items you need. Sucks
7899	0	a	NOTE: I DO NOT THINK THIS IS JUST A MINECRAFT RIP-OFF. PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU ASSUME I DID! I gave this game as fair a chance as I could, but, ultimately, I was very dissappointed with it. Unless you have this game already, or are already very good at this game, then it will be very, VERY difficult. The only multiplayer is NOT private (as far as I could tell) so I could NOT get my friend's help, and the tutorial guy wasn't helpful in the slightest. I came in expecting what the rumors said: a MC ripoff. BOY was I wrong. The only simularity I could find was blocks. EVERYTHING else is VASTLY different. Not to mention I wasn't able to get a house built to protect me from those GAD DANG FLYING FISH. OH THOSE FISH! THOSE STUPID FISH!!! I found the game frustrating and annoying. I was NOT able to get into it. So, from personal experiance, I do not reccomend this game to anyone who hasn't gotten at least SOME idea of what you're doing. (other than building XD)

7909	0	a	Fantastic game with crippling issues. I can very rarely join online servers. Sometimes I am able to join however most of the time (49 out of 50 times), the 'accept' button you have to press to join the server does absolutely nothing when I fix it. There are other reports of this issue online as well but seemingly no fixes. Terraria has given me a lot of enjoyment however I've had enough of the multiplayer issues.

7920	0	a	When I first started this game I was all Hyped up. But Then The update came so I was So happy I had My character Prepared for a new world and Then A day after the 1.3 Update, I lost all my data My characters My worlds My servers Everything. I was quite Enraged But, I kept cool And decided to Restart. So After that I was Having So much fun with My friends and I was so happy And active Until I came back to terraria and All my data was Deleted AGAIN! So I just will end Up filing a complaint To Redigit and get my money back. I Would advise this game Highly if you Like Losing data.

7925	0	a	Wow, this is arguably the most stupid game ever conceived right next to minecraft. No intro, no tutorial, you can reconfigure only half of the controls, and the other half just works randomly. I got it because of a fun looking intro movie after I saw it was the 10th most played game on steam. After spending 30 minutes messing around with it, I want my 30 minutes of my life wasted, back. Plus interest.

7945	0	a	its just boring
7946	0	a	It is just a cheap minecraft with even crappier graphics. sure, it has more stuff, but what is the point of all of that stuff if you can only use it in a 2d, limited size world. Even if it had billions of different types of mobs, blocks, biomes, etc. , it would not count for anything.  Another thing, sure minecraft is not anywhere close to being the best game in the world, but it is still better than this. No, not just because it is 3d, but because the capabilities of a flat, tiny world are nothing compared to the endless, modable, and versitile environment has to offer.
7947	0	a	This game sucks, buy Starbound, not this poop, buy Starbound, period.
7948	0	a	this sucks it crashes hole the time!

7960	0	a	I didnt pay for price for this because it doesent really look that interesting by the pictures, only a 2D mini world to explore and hit stuff as people explain. If you know what you are doing then its a good game, if not then its pointless even getting it as all you can do is basic crafting until you find some good gear. Single player worlds do get very boring and before you buy this game please take note that this game is multiplayer but you will have to create a server to play with friends which is FREE. If you like the game and are getting bored of it you can buy the new terraria game called starbound which you can travel to SPACE.
7961	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, don't buy it.
7962	0	a	This game is Aufull. I started playing after my friend reccomended it but I can not reccomend it. There is no tutorial on the crafting so I have no clue what im doing, and when your trying to craft monsters randomly spawn and attack you. Also the crafting guy keeps disappering constantly. 0/10
7963	0	a	That Graphics
7964	0	a	What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i thought minecraft was first-person. 0/10 No i wouldnt recommend, go play minecraft.

7966	0	a	this game sucked my dead viking grandads balls
7967	0	a	Bought it to play with friends and regret it, I do not recommend it because I did not enjoy it but I know many people did, this is 2D minecraft that's harder and more complicated.
7968	0	a	I can not even play multiplayer which means this game is not worth it i can not enter the server port
7969	0	a	idk what to say if this good or bad but its kinda boring to me for some reason even thought i beat 1 boss and get awesome stuff its kinda boring but the boss fight is kinda good but thats the only thing i like
7970	0	a	Minecraft copy :D
7971	0	a	Absolutely dissapointed. Okay game by yourself but i bought for the fact i wanted to play with my gf but hey guess what the multiplayer connection is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like how the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do you do this?
7972	0	a	I played the game on the iPad and enjoyed it. Friends told me the PC version was even better, so I purchased it from steam. This game has good promise but crashes upon startup and is not playable. Example: Upon install the game would crash every time I tried to create my first character - I looked up the problem on the web and discovered I had to do a regedit just to get it to create a character without crashing. After the regedit, I managed to play for an hour or two. Several days later I tryied to play it again - now it doesnt appear to run at all - If I choose single player it immediately crashes to desktop with unhandled system.IO exceptions. I've spent some time trying to look up the solution, but none of the recommendations work.  Apparently the programmers need to go back to school and learn how to write code that doesnt crash.  save your money - dont buy this game.
7973	0	a	it annoys me
7974	0	a	i had alot of fun and shred alot of gnar with my frends i rallyed up and it was relly fun playing this i relly reccomend this to everyone who is reading this if u dont have this game and this its ar ip off of miencraft then â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you
7975	0	a	Children in Uganda probably had more fun playing with their rocks than me playing this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.
7976	0	a	its an okay game but i mean but it dosent have any replay value gets boring after 2 hrs
7977	0	a	This game is like your mom. It sucks.
7978	0	a	It's OK, I guess.   Do you like playing with legos? Go for it. Do you like sand boxes (the real ones), go make a castle. Do you like Tier based mining, digging, or otherwise going deeper? Enjoy. Do you like arbitrary aesthetics? Woopie! Mindless enemies trying to fly into you all the time? Boy howdie!  11/9 Would prefer over minecraft.
7979	0	a	I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate game cammy cam cam
7980	0	a	I refunded this game because it wouldn't let me join servers.... but I didn't get my money back ;~;
7981	0	a	I did not like this game. Why? I dont know...  I Just thought it was boring... DonÂ´t hate me!  I got spawn killed by a zombie so I had to load a new world, so thats a thing.
7982	0	a	I see why so many people love this game and for a while I did too. You can only gather and craft for so long before it really begins to feel tedious. If you like minecraft or starbound this is more of the same. For me, too much of the same.
7983	0	a	If you came here to read bad stuff about Terraria then you gotta look elsewhere.
7984	0	a	I really could not get into this game. I wasted 15 minutes and there was nothing to lure me back to play it.
7985	0	a	call me a filthy casual but I share the same idea as Yahtzee, the term 'It gets better later' should not be a valid argument because if someone isnt having fun they should have every right to put the game down and play something else.  Somewhere under here is an amazing game but I will never ever play 10 hours of boring â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ just to get to the good parts, as a game should be engaging from the start.
7986	0	a	This game. Well, I'm sorry but i just don't like it. You dig and amass your shiny weapons and armor and equipment, but it just feels so dull. On single player I could scarcely play for 10 minutes straight without saying 'why am I even playing this?'
7987	0	a	is there anyway to avoid losing game files because i just lost 41 hours of game play. not happy with this and hopefully steam can fix this bug to avoid this from happening to anybody else
7988	0	a	Lost all saves, kindly *** you ReLogic
7989	0	a	Game very good. Graphics es very good. In me country we say game je â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥o. the game first person shooter. over 5 weapons to choose from which = unlimted possibilities. el story is shito. in conclsion the game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. I reomiendo it.
7990	0	a	great game. my saves got deleted. thanks obama.
7991	0	a	After 10ish hours of this game it just becomes all repetitve and boring.
7992	0	a	from now on dont buy it. buy starbound its like a better version of terraria with more items and there are even different universes in starbound
7993	0	a	Pretty much Minecraft.

7997	0	a	The devs of this game are terrible people. It's a good game, but i'd recommend pirating it just so they don't get money.
7998	0	a	Terrible server setup. After trying multiple tactics involving port forwarding, Firewall exceptions and UPnP it randomly stops working while other connections to different ports on my PC from outside work fine.
7999	0	a	I picked this up during a steam sale, I should have saved my $3 to put towards legos to step on. That would have been more enjoyable.
8000	0	a	I was fun to explore the random mines for about an hour but then this got very boring. You just gather crap and kill boring monsters.

8003	0	a	I WANNA UPDATE FOR DIS GAME then ill like it :) but dis games great
8004	0	a	All I can remember is digging blocks for hours wondering what I was doing with my life and wishing it would stop.   You set your own goals in this game, and it pretty much revolves around collecting things to get the next tier of armor and tools.   There is building things and combat, but sense of accomplishment for building anything isn't as grand as seeing it in 3D like in Minecraft because of the fixed 2D perspective, and the combat is clicking down until someone's health bar runs out.   It'll waste a lot of your time, it's intentionally designed to be addictive and drawn out.
8005	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and boring game
8006	0	a	Minecraft clone minus all the good features (including 3D). I paid $2.50 for the game, not worth it. Do you know what IS a good game? If you said Mount &amp; Blade: Warband, then you are correct. I regret buying and playing this game.

8009	0	a	First time playing this game and got chased by some wiered creature spent ages underground to protect myself from them and then was killed by a stupid umbrela 10/10 would never play again.
8010	0	a	I will be honest--this game is fun for a little bit, but sincerely, it gets boring after a while. It gets way too easy when you can just bring your stuff into every world and everything is accessible. Don't get me wrong--the game is okay, but it's not something I'd spend money on. Good thing my friend gifted it to me :P
8011	0	a	its not that great
8012	0	a	This game has not loaded for me for the last couple of months. I have reinstalled both Terraria and Steam a couple of times each but still nothing has happened. And until I can play it... 0/5
8013	0	a	Boring. Usually I like survival games but this one just bored me. I can definitely see why people like it, but honestly, I didn't like it much.
8014	0	a	I never really got into terraria. Just my opinion, this game is just another one of those 2D survivals. EDIT: Wow, people do not like opinion. I said I just never got into it, I'm not stopping you from playing.
8015	0	a	At first it was fun....but the more you play, the more you wanna play.....minecraft!?  Yep, its true, this is a okey game on its own merits, but the comparison to minecraft is undeniable.  Terrarias greatest pro, is its sidescrolling view....but also its biggest con.  This will be different from player to player, and if youre a Minecrafter youÂ´ll find some fun things here. But most people just play a little, then go back to minecraft.  Therefor i cant recommend this, because i were one of those who quickly got bored and moved on.   I love that its available and buyable, but i wouldnt buy it, if i could instead get minecraft.
8016	0	a	Not my kind of games. I can't see a reason to prefer it to Minecraft, really.

8019	0	a	I know this isn't going to be a popular review, but please respect other peoples points of view. It isn't about 'agreeing' with it, it's about being useful for people who want to buy it. Thank you.  First, I have to confess that I love Minecraft. Since it isn't on Steam, I haven't kept track of how many hours I've played it. Countless, certainly. And yes, this is most likely biased because I played Minecraft previously to Terraria.   Many people say that Terraria is like Minecraft, but in 2D. It isn't. While they certainly have in common that you explore caves, kill enemies and build things, that's where the similitudes end.  While at Minecraft the focus is around exploration and building, I feel that the focus at Terraria is just the exploration. It certainly has more interesting types of caves than the monothematic Minecraft ones, but at the same time the building options combined with the scrolling view limit the options to 'a house made of stone/wood' and 'n number of floors'. There isn't much room for decoration when all furniture is prefabricated (as in, you create the chair, not put together certain blocks to make something it looks like a chair to you), and you only have 2D to work with.  Speaking of exploration: Terraria's caves are huge. That's a pro for some people, I guess. For me, and compared to Minecraft, it just felt like I never get anywhere. Dig, dig, dig, get the same type of ore that you don't need anymore because the higher-grade tools you made won't ever break.  Other than the extreme dullness of digging with no objective in mind (since you don't know a darn thing about the world), there's no peril in the caves worth mentioning (medium difficulty). Some bat here and there, no damage that you won't regen in 5 secons after. Unless, of course, we speak of the traps. Diabollicaly hidden traps that willl instakill you during at least your 20 first hours of gameplay, making you drop all your items on the floor. God help you if you don't know which way you came from, or if you did need this upgraded equipement you just lost to clear your path there.  People also say that both Minecraft and Terraria are about crafting. Lies. Terraria lets you craft things, in the same sense Skyrim lets you craft tour own weapons and house furniture. Neither of them are games about crafting just because you can craft a handful of items, and in my opinion, Terraria just doesn't step out of the linear paths of crafting where the ores will make bars and the bars will make armor and there it ends. There's only just so much room in a screen for decorative objects cluttering it. No first person view, no eye candy.  Before ending, I want to make clear that I understand that some people may like this game. It just ins't for me, and I think it's important that possible buyers have both parties POV.  Veredict: 5/10
8020	0	a	somethangs rong its got a line in the main menu going up and down and glitchs it gives me a bad time
8021	0	a	dude this minecraft is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gay its not even 3d like call of duty lmao
8022	0	a	I found this game insanely boring and glitchy. It doesn't flow at all. It takes about 20 clicks to get a single block down, as well as the combat is very slow and boring. I don't even know what to rate this, it's so bad. XD
8023	0	a	It's like Minecraft, except worse.
8024	0	a	I am a MAJOR Minecraft fan. My friend decided I should buy Terraria while it was on a $2 sale. I bought it thinking I was getting a great deal. When in reality, $2 should be the original price! This game is awfully boring when your alone, and still even boring with your friends! And let me tell you this, your character transers ALL it's items to whatever server you enter. If you hop on a PVP server, you better hope you put your items away,. This game wasn't for me. It might be for you! This is a worse version of Minecraft... and too easy.
8025	0	a	Absolutely horrible. I spent 2.50 on it and I feel robbed. The Hindenburg was a better idea than this game.

8030	0	a	Baught this game and hate it. Would NOT reccomend it and I am never playing it again. Want a game better than terraria but a tiny bit like it? Minecraft.
8031	0	a	TL;DR (Save $10, don't buy this garbage.)  After playing his load of garbage for many hours I can finally conclude that it isn't worth $10 or even $5 or anything at all. It is a 2-D sandbox with zero effort put into it and a very unbalanced difficulty system. At first glance it looks all well and good but after you reach a certain point defeating a boss called the Wall of Flesh the game falls into the stupidly difficult Hard mode where monster kill you in seconds even with 'Hard mode armor' equiped, Overpowered Bosses can spawn at any time including when you don't even have proper weapons to defeat them at all, and stupid events like a Christmas themed 'Frost Moon' occur spawning literally thousands of mobs that kill your NPCs and kill you and force you to die multiple times in a single night costing you loads of money. And the developer for this worthless game has made almost no progress in patching or updating these problems. This is one of the most boring games ever. It's on the same level as Starbound in all honesty, great idea terrible presentation. Do yourself a favor don't waste your time on this stupid game, the playerbase is full of fanboys and girls who think this game is the best game ever but they dont see what I see; a bad game with poor game design and unbalanced gameplay.
8032	0	a	DO YOU LIKE A GAME WHERE ALL YOU DO IS CHEAT IN CRAP? NOTHING LEGIT? NO FUN? WELL THIS PIECE OF CRAP GAME IS MADE FOR YOU. ALL YOU DO IS FIND A CHEAT SERVER GET CRAP AND ENJOY YOUR WORTHLESS LIFE GO AHEAD AND WASTE YOUR LIFE KNOWING YOU ARE HORRIBLE GAMES AND LIFE. SO BUY THIS GAME THAT RIPES APARTS GREAT FRIENDS AND YOUR SANITY. BUY NOW! NO SARCASM HERE NOPE WHATS SARCASM? NO SARCASM IF YOU THINK THIS IS SARCASM YOUR STUPID

8034	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. But much like minecraft I can never figure out what to do. These survival style games drive me nuts.
8035	0	a	2d clone of Minecraft. Very boring gameplay.

8038	0	a	Gets boring pretty fast, in the end it's just another lazy minecraft clone. Don't waste your money.
8039	0	a	There isn't any guidance to the game... its just a place to build a pixel fantasy. Sure I know there are boses but I shouldn't have to read text or do research to figure anything out... this game isn't my life. It was a nice little thing to do on my own. Try to put in wiki's and stuff in the game... Like a tutorial or something.... Also, you can do an infinate amount more with the games, why aren't you using it. Always the same creatures and same rythm of random bad guys who spawn and try to hurt you... Nothing on the positve side except little pots which you can bust open once. Perhaps more crafting would make it better. I'll come back in a few years and see what your up to. For now, a disgusting review about another pointless game which decays my life quality anyways.

Whitey-tighties now stained red, I charged on into the ever present challenge we all know as life, equiped with my blood soaked briefs and the knowledge that backpacks can prove to be fatal.

I starting getting Bored. Everytime same Bosses. Getting more easyer and easyer. There is only 1 way to beat the game. Kill Moonloard (last boss). He is very easy and u can farm him to get even more good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to make everything easy peasy.  Multiplayer: If u wanna play with friends then u neeed a rly good Internet or u can forgot it. I have 700 mb and lags only if im playing in Multiplayer. My friend has 1000 mb and even dat lags. So you need to have a Really Good Internet or its gonna lag every 2 min.

8064	0	a	Do not play this game. It takes too much time, just look at how many hours people spend playing it!   Games should be played once, and beaten. You cannot do that with this game, so don't bother trying. It is different everytime I make a world! Who would ever want something that can be replayed differently, every time? Certainly not me!  There is too much to do in Terraria. I don't want to be bothered with 'building' structures and 'mining' for resources. What is this? The digital apartheid workforce of South Africa? People do not want to do that!  I hope that after reading this, you will never, ever, for risk of shame, think of playing this game. Do not do it. I warned you.  You already did, didn't you. You hated it, right?   Bah!   There must be something wrong with you.

8066	0	a	You know... I loved this game. Got some of the best best weapons and me and my friends would gather around the computer and try to defeat a boss. Then today happened. My characters highlight was red and my worlds were gone. Now i am locked out of my character and no good worlds so I think this game is very stupid and dont waste money or time on this game. Its not worth it. I have regrets of wasting so many hours of gameplay on this. This is a train wreck.

8071	0	a	I don't because I'd recommend buying Starbound, it's made by the same guys (I think), pretty similar but WAY bigger! I enjoyed Terraria a lot but since I rushed through it pretty quickly I couldn't tell you to buy it ASAP! Hope this helps!
8072	0	a	This game is like trying to play Mario on the Comadore 64 while simultaniously jerking yourself and your neighbor's hot 18 year old son off to the sound of Marilyn Manson played backwards over a tin of grated cheese and over cooked, over seasoned rice. All in all, I would rather have every single tooth yanked out of my skull, ground up, and then shoved into my veins through the worlds biggest needle than play this game again.

8153	0	a	*MY SPELLING IS HORRIBLE* Terraria, Minecraft vs Terraria, The Big wars back then, I was a huge minecraft fan back then (Alpha Stage :D) But Now since Wallet sucker simulator (TF2) I now sit for 24/7. I thought of giving Terraria a try since it was 4.99 on sale. When I bought it, I was very excited, I read alot of good reviews about it. But I regret it. ALOT. First of all, The Music was good for like 3 minutes and it just sucked badly, The Loop was horrible and I had to mute it. But Before I mute it I made my character, It was nice you could make your character your 'Style'. I waited for like 5 minutes when finally it finished. Then I was so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing confused. I didnt know any of the controls. All I did was break trees, get wood, break stone or rock or whatever, And Made a mini house. First of all, the Crafting system is HORRIBLE, The Minecraft crafting systems are atleast better. Anyway After like 20 minutes my Fingers had start to hurt ALOT. Because in this game and Minecraft, You have to click the mouse button FOREVER. This was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off the max, And for some reason if I hold the mouse button it doesnt break anything or attack. I had to install a 'Auto Click' So my fingers could â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rest, When it was night Monsters came out, I didnt craft â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and all I had was the wooden sword,Axe,Pick and some stone and wood. Monsters came out of nowere and I died the moment I when Rambo and killed them. Then I just quit. The Next day My Computer had 'Thousands of Virus' I had to use my Virus Check (Malware Anti-Bytes) and Waited for like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 10 hours. I thanked GabeN because I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my pants thinking if my steam was hacked. Then I played terraria again. I waited again and It was still night. WTF I died like so many times. I was getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, And So I just 'Idle' Until night was over While I was on 'Idle' I played some Kirby Super Star Ultra, Since its my favroite game and Im a HUGE â™¥â™¥â™¥ Kirby Fan. Anyway I waited for like 10 minutes until it was day, and the day started. I mined until I fell into a Botomless Pit, and Died because a hungry pack of monsters were about to eat my satanic corpse. Then I just Quit and played some CS:GO. I did this review before steam added refunds, But Your game could have more then 2 hours on it, OR You could not have it for more then 2 weeks, Well â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I had that game for like 2 months. Im not a Minecraft Fanboy, But I would rather spend $26 Dollars on a blocky game that has GOOD Reviews (Not IGNorant reviews). This was a Waste if $5. I would buy some TF2 Keys, or Buy pack of LEGO's to entertain my self. Too Make this easier   Pros -9.99 Dollars (4.99 Dollars on sale) -Nice Character Customizing  The Best Pros, Has to be the Uninstall button, Its a great feature to Terraria and every other game on steam. -UNINSTALL BUTTON WORKS! UNINSTALL BUTTON NO LONGER EARLY-ACCESS   Cons  -Fanboys Minecraft Vs Terâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Etc. -Finger gets Cancer -Auto Click install -4.99 Dollars given to GabeN -Every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing IGN Review about this game  -Too Minecraft Like, Get something more original not just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game like BLOCKADE 3D -And Everything else in the game -Music -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ monster -No â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Turtorial or 'Training' Mode, WTF -Playing with Multiplayer takes forever and its a waste of MY Time -0.8 Hours of my Life wasted on this horrid â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  Anyway This Game should REALLY DESERVE a Dead Kirby out of 10  By That I mean 3.5/10   Remember This is MY OPINION NOT YOURS! IF I GET RAGE COMMENTS OF 5 YEAR OLDS RAGING THERE â™¥â™¥â™¥ OVER ME Ill Just respond, With Not worth my time  For the GRAND FINALLY HERE IS MY 2 JOKES OF THE DAY   Joke 2 What do you call a Blank sheet of paper? Unfinished â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Terraria    JOKE OF THE DAY You cant spell IGNorant without IGN in it =/   Hope this review help some people either a Good or Bad way, Anyway have a great day!
8154	0	a	I'd give this game a 6.9/100 since its not fun at all. But the 6.9 is because it looks like my favorite game Dead Rising 2: Case West. The main characters of Terraria are Chris Brown and North West. They enter the phenotrans facility and yuck it up for about 69 minutes. The best part of this game is the online. GTerrariA Online is a great expansion to the very great single player. Rockstar really hit a homerun on this game. Have you ever wanted to play a 2D game in 2013? Well you're in luck! Terraria sells for the very cheap price of 6.99 on the origin website. If you want to get 69% off Terraria on uPlay you can ask your neighborhood MrFatSwag and he'll pull a promocode out of his â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8155	0	a	So addicted :)
8156	0	a	This game is soo boring
8157	0	a	I Tried.
8158	0	a	There is something that people love in those sandbox games that I don't get. After spending an hour gathering ressources and building houses, I am bored to death. Exploring dungeons for miles and miles underworld just doesn't appeal to me. And don't get me started on clicking on blocks for hours and hours... I'd rather do a literary commentary than wasting my time and computer on this. But other than that, it's a cool looking game with plenty of possibilities (I'm sure!). I'm just not a fan of those games.
8159	0	a	I am going to be honest about this game. Ok, I don't care if people like this review or not, I just want to state my point.  This game is not worth you, or your friend's money. And if it were free, it wouldn't be worth you or your friend's time. The game is currently uninstalled as a result, sitting in my steam library, most likely not to be touched ever again.  Let's face it. Terraria is a 2D game, with 2D performence. There is literally NO point in this game. Kill monsters, get gold, waste 15 too many hours looking for someone to spend that said money, only to find that whatever you bought was a piece of trash. You can only build 2D things. As a personal player of Minecraft myself, there is no need to get this game. The most you could do is pixel art, and even that is better on the game listed before. Nothing in this game is interesting. If you find yourself able to build 2D castles, fine, that floats your boat. But ask yourself this. Why are you getting this game? Are you truly going to be amazed by this game? Is it worth the money? There are better games out there, that cost less, and actually bring you an experience. As a person who has wasted too much time and gone through the pain of finding my money completely wasted, please take a moment to think, and only buy this game, if this game has EXACTLY what you are looking for, and is perfect for your tastes. Otherwise, save your pennies, and buy a better game. (And for those who think that I am going all out hate, don't even get me started on the devs related around this 'franchise' of this style of game).
8160	0	a	Story: Got Game. Chopped Tree. Built House. Mined Stuff. Turned House Into Ice Bricks. Looked Cool. Built 2 Other Houses. Got Bored. Quit...
8161	0	a	this game is buttcheecks
8162	0	a	Forced to play this game by my son who loves it. The control system is poor so it never feels natural. Most deaths are because it dosent do what you want it to. Its fussy to the point that if a pixel is in the way you dont move. The ores are unclear and look too simular. It dosent support networking very well meaning you have to faff about with it to play on a LAN. Internet play is harder still. All this for a 2d version of minecraft. Its a mess and makes minecraft look like a shining example of design and programming brilliance.
8163	0	a	This game is not for me. I don't know why... I see a lot of people playing it, and I'm sure they're having fun with it, but not me. I think it's downright boring. I had the same feeling with Minecraft. Sure, I knew before I bought this game that it would be somewhat similar to Minecraft, but still, I like to experience all games myself. That's the reason I buy so many games. Anyway, in this game you get to kill enemies and chop wood, things like that. With the resources you build things like houses and weapons. That's the basic idea. There are no objectives, there's no mission. You just create a world of your own, fighting enemies along the way. I salute those who do have the patience to put hundreds of hours into these games, creating the best worlds possible, exploring everything, doing everything, but next time I see a game like this I'll just simply ignore it. Period.  [Rating: 66/100]

8168	0	a	Fun at start, then gets boring once there's nothing left to do
8169	0	a	I cannot fathom any reason people would enjoy, or even play this game. It's repetitive, slow, unoriginal and plain boring as hell. If you enjoy this kind of thing, I would highly recommend playing Starbound, because even the deep-beta that that game is in at this moment, it blows Terraria right out of the water. Steer clear of this one, because â‚¬ 10,- is ridiculous for this kind of crap.

8184	0	a	I couldn't really get into this game, but most of my friends are addicted to it.  I guess you just gotta try it and see if you like it, which I didn't. (Did I mention that already? :&gt;)
8185	0	a	You like PLAYING games? dont buy this!
8186	0	a	Well i was playing with my ranger and about to get full shroomite armor then i lag. I try to restart my computer, come back on and then boom. My character said 'Marksman' in red. And i couldnt play on the character and he had nothing equiped. Then i try going on the world and my game crashes. Is my world and character corrupted? If it is, learn to fix it. Thanks Terraria &lt;3
8187	0	a	Nah not that good aye.
8188	0	a	Its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, don't play it
8189	0	a	Good for salty nerds like me. It's good for a little while.
8190	0	a	Every person I've known who enjoyed this game smelled of burnt pizza farts. Avoid.
8191	0	a	This is a fun game that can be played for hours when it works. Recently this game crashes on startup, and can't be played. I reinstalled .Net and XNA, but the game still crashes on startup.
8192	0	a	The dev(s?) behind this game promised Steam Achievements, and then he was just decided to abandon that idea. This game, therefore, loses its appeal for me. I feel ripped off by this undelivered feature.
8193	0	a	This game will become a great disappointment for players that gives lots of time to it. If you will run into situation when your PC is accidentaly shuts down during game then don't be surprised to lose everything you created. Your character and your world will be erased due to some bug that is well known by developers and they don't bother themselfs to fix it.
8194	0	a	Good for salty nerds like me. It's good for a little while.
8195	0	a	Cool game, it has a lot of depth, but I'd rather play Minecraft.
8196	0	a	This is absolute junk! No other way to say it its just junk! 
8197	0	a	I don't agree with consoles having exclusive content so I regret buying this on PC.
8198	0	a	All I have to say is that this game is bland and linear. I am telling you that there is no end game once you grind through hours and hours to get better gear you head into combat that involves jumping around, spaming pots, and rapidly clicking in an atempt to kill bosses that just spam attacks back at you. The building and creativity of this game is severly limited by the 2d and the building should have been put in the background so that when you open a door you can enter your home. The way it currently works is that you place blocks and make a wall around you and must jump over or walk through your house making it feel much less like a house. This game was also made just for the money as you can find many clips around youtube of the devs saying they patch it to make money. Also this game was orginally planned to move fully to xbox and have the pc updates end. Why? simple to get the hundreds of players to pay more money to play with new items. The devs are just plain evil and the game itself will get boring dispite it's inital appeal. Personally I would not have bought the game knowing that the devs have taken down honest reviews of the game for 'copyright' purposes yet left extremely positive reveiws untouched. Please do the world a favor go play a good indie game deserving of your money.

I may try to play this again soon, but honestly I think I'll rate this down 4/10
8210	0	a	This game... This game is only fun if you have no other game installed on your computer and your internet is off... thats the only time i've played it... unless my friends wanted me to play it.... The poor developer brought this game to handheld devises because he wasent making enough money from the poor 5 year old downers. If you like Mario and Minecraft you should get this game... But the design of it i do not like and is too rough around the edges.

8226	0	a	I've almost had enough
8227	0	a	Terraria is a 2D crafting exploration game. It has called itself the 2D Minecraft, but this game puts a higher emphasis on combat. More enemies, more attack patterns, more weapons that do unique things including grappling hooks, grenades, throwing stars, sticky grenades and so on.   Once you create your character, the game generates an entire world when you start, so no two playthroughs are exactly the same. When you begin, you have a pic axe, wood axe and sword. Wood axes cut down trees, pic axes dig and take down things you've put up and swords, spears, bows and other weapons are efficient for dealing with enemies. The only problem here is switching between all three with the use of the mouse wheel. Not just that, but you'll need to aim your mouse cursor at blocks and enemies. Mouse aim on a platformer isn't that fun, but its even worse on PSN.  The left mouse button is to use the object you have highlighted in your inventory. The right mouse button interacts with things such as opening doors. There is a jump key that thankfully you can rebind, since I find it difficult to traverse when I need to move to the right, jump and aim with the mouse. There is an inventory button where you'll not only see a list of 10 hotkeyed items up at the top, but a crafting system that lets you easily craft from things in your inventory. You won't have to guess what combination of things will make something, the game bluntly tells you that you can make this, because you have this and that. You will need workshop tables and smelters to make more complex items like armor. Its a nice system, but the array of items you can craft is limited to one column instead of an entire grid of things. This causes you to have to scroll to what you want to build instead of just selecting it from a giant grid like the inventory.  You can equip your character with armor, helmets, greaves (leg armor) and other things you find along the way like climbing claws. Its as easy as drag and drop. Life will regenerate, but if you don't have the time, potions will do and you can even craft a campfire to increase the generation. The game gives you treasures that make me feel overpowered and invulnerable too early in the game. Finding things adds another interesting layer because of how much loot is in a single chest and getting to the treasures is always interesting. Finding underground rooms, having to dig a chest out of a wall that you may have missed the first 8 times you passed by it.  With all of the materials you harvest, wood, dirt, stone, gold, copper, and so on, you can use them to build and craft. Build platforms to get to higher places or keep from dropping to your death. Build walls to protect yourself from zombies at night. Build doors to let you and other NPCs through, but keep out enemies. You can make your own creations. Want a treehouse, go for it. Want to make a Castlevania style mansion with stone gargoyles made with copper walls? Go for it. You can even have friends drop into your world to help and play.  There is a lot of creativity in the game, both in enemy design, world terrain and what you can craft. Stronger monsters lurk in the dark either in caves or at night. You can put down torches to keep them from respawning and you can carry a torch to light your way, you just can't 'work' or fight while carrying a torch. The enemies feel good, they'll jump, float and fly at you from odd angles, but the combat just doesn't. Uneven terrain with a sword that only goes forward can leave you at a great disadvantage, especially flying enemies that come from all sorts of different angles, but luckily a lot of weapons have mouse aim and even then it can be difficult to hit enemies. Axes and other weapons have a full overhead to forward attack that seems good. Some weapons have a chance to knock back enemies that feels helpful.  Because this is a game of exploration, you have a mini map that helps a lot if you want it, but not just that you have a big overall map. You'll only see territory you've explored. You don't have to have it or use it, in fact there's a permadeath hardcore mode, but whenever I spend hours in a single playthrough, I don't want to feel like my time was wasted like that. My work and time spent chopping down trees, digging through dirt, assembling things.  There is a lot of creativity and the chance to build a 2D castle of your dreams, mold strange worlds to your liking and explore the depths of lava labyrinths. You can sink hours, days, months and years into this game by building and exploring. With all of this being said, the game feels more like work than fun. I want a game that I can play. I never felt that I was getting anywhere with hours into it. Playing with friends in the game was a lot of fun, but friends make everything fun.

8232	0	a	Purchasing this game is like purchasing an ineffective enima- You assumed you got your money's worth, but instead you end up with constipation, and then eventually hemroids.
8233	0	a	Someone decided it would be a good idea to turn Dig Dug into an RPG...some game ideas should just be left in the 80s, and this is one of them.
8234	0	a	Multiplayer is confusing as hell. Several of my friends and I all own the game, and we have yet to figure out how to play together. Basically, you have to host a server, and then your friends have to join by entering your computer's IP address, plus some other port address, and it's not explained anywhere within the game. In otherwords, you have to know exactly who you're playing with before hand. You can't just go looking for a random server to make friends in. Single player is relatively fun, but without other players you'll likely find yourself becoming bored rather quickly. Assuming you can get the multiplayer to work, however, you can carry the same character over from server to server and use all of the same items you previously collected. This was really a game meant for multiple people, but they went about it in a very poor way. Overall, I would say don't get this game if you wanted to play it with a friend.
8235	0	a	I like the ability to at ease move around and dig and build with quick and with no limits that i have to rest all the time ability. This game is a good game.  THE DOWN FALL: The game has tone of items with no auto up date book guide how to or what for so your not waisting your life on never fining the right item or thing or what ever needs to be done to move on. Like i said just because you can make more of this or that dose not make a good game. You have to have a personal auto book you carry to look at to now how to build this or that not look online for those who have no life out side of games.
8236	0	a	Boring and bad multiplayer system
8237	0	a	This game is boring... AS HELL... The only funny part is when you're digging to see if you can reach the center of the earth...
8238	0	a	okay game, but overly complicated and really just not that fun to play (epecially if everyone you know has played a lot longer than you). you better off spending your $10 somewhere else.
8239	0	a	Boring and bad multiplayer system

8248	0	a	CastleVania: Symphony of the Terraria is the latest in a long standing series of running back and forth simulators developed by Namco-Bandai. In this latest offering, the ante has truly been upped, nearly as high as the bar has been hoisted. Gone are the scary vampires from the original titles,as they've been replaced by annoying eyeballs that crash into until you die.   Minecraft: The Super Mario Brothers Super Show is quite possibly the pinnacle of games where you go left until you find a castle. The soundtrack pulses with 1960s thunder as you delve ever deeper into the planet's core. By the time I found a diamond, I knew that Motherlode: Prepare to Die Edition was a cornerstone of the 'Bullet Hell' genre of 2D shooters.  Dig Dug II: Assassins of Kings is the premier digging simulator of 2011. It features such stunningly dynamic gameplay interfaces as trees that fall down, alongside terrifying and challenging boss battles such as fan favorite 'That's a really big eyeball.'  This game has everything. Side scrolling. Digging. Bats. NPCs.  When I built a F/A-18 Super Horney using only wooden planks and eyeballs, I knew this was the game for me. Overall, I give Bebe's Kids: The Fall of Max Payne a mystifying 3/10.

8250	0	a	ItÂ´s a mhhhm game.... that is bored as hell and there are non good servers sooo dont buy it.
8251	0	a	After 1,100 hours on this game I would have to say that it is fun to play with friends but solo not so fun, I dont recommend this game it's one of those games where you play for a certain amount of time, but then you dont go back to it. so #NO
8252	0	a	Jeez. I get it. It's creative and totally undirected. But it's also slow and extremely frustrating. Not sure how to describe it in terms of genre but it's certainly not an RPG. More like platform build-em-up. Not for me I'm afraid. No score.
8253	0	a	I got this game for free. Still want my money back.
8254	0	a	I couldn't get into it. The controls are so hackneyed it felt like I was fighting walruses in a tub of Jell-O with a waterlogged roll of off-brand paper towels. The inventory system is a mess, it's like looking for a red marble in a sea of red M&amp;Ms. And what's with the resolution? Drug Wars on a TI-81 has more fidelity. Terraria, more like Terriblia.

8259	0	a	Its an okay game, only bought it to play with friends. I bought it when it was $10.00 and i really got bored of it quick. Reminds me of like block builder or minecraft just 2d. Can be a really fun game with friends but i would't recommend it by yourself or $10.00 and over.
8260	0	a	Starbounds dumber older cousin
8261	0	a	Can't walk backwards while attacking. Even in 1.3. No thanks.
8262	0	a	This game is horrible. It advertises multiplayer gameplay, but setting that up is a nightmare and a half. I sat down with 3 other people for over 2 hours trying to get the multiplayer aspect to work; tried creating a dedicated server; tried messing with the router's port forwarding settings and firewall. This game fails at delivering something very simple that should not be such a hassle. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOUR ONLY INTENTION IS TO PLAY SINGLE PLAYER.   2/10  Sent the devs an email asking for a refund.

8278	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. 
8279	0	a	Ok so a few things. I'll start with singleplayer. Single player is fricking amazing, the bosses, the armour, the ores, the npcs, everything is flawless. Oh god not the multiplayer. I have never tried joining a dedicated server, but holy hell, is it impossible to host a server and play with friends. You might be able to figure it out, but not without a tutorial somewhere and a very extensive knowledge about computers. My rate 6.7/10. It would be great as a single player game, but taunts you with its multiplayer option.
8280	0	a	What the fuq is wrong with you. Really tho.
8281	0	a	I wish people would stop making negative reviews for such a great game!
8282	0	a	if your looking here for reasons not to play the game then u should kill yourself
8283	0	a	this game made me want to kill my dog so i did  -micheal vick
8284	0	a	Quite complicated.
8285	0	a	I'd rather watch grass grow.
8286	0	a	+ Gets enjoyable after a lot of hours  - The idea isn't original - Very slow based - Boring - Getting started takes ages - The lack of instructions - You have no idea what are you supposed to do if you don't read guides - Get's even more boring after completing it - The annoying soundtrack - You get stuck a lot - The tools last far too long - Getting out of the underground alive is quite an achvievement in the early game - The creators of the game bann YouTube users that dislike this game - The backround - All the customisation abilities on the character look ugly - The art style hurts my eyes - Far too many reason why to dislike this game
8287	0	a	It's been surpassed by everything in the genre and combines the worst aspects of sandbox games: Grinding, not being very open-ended (It forces you to activate hardmode to unlock half the game), has little to no mod support, it's impossible to not get killed dozens of times even at endgame so people who just want to build with nice blocks are SOL, the game is extremely graphic so it alienates anyone who might be squeamish and the main developer is a complete tool with no sense of commitment.  Just go buy Starbound, Crea, Magicite, Signs of Life or one of the other games out there where the dev team actually seems to give a crap about the community.
8288	0	a	Good game but its version on the ipad is better as it is easy to use
8289	0	a	As a builder game, its boring with tedious disruptions. As a fighting game its the simpliest hack and slash. All combined - mindless grind that rewards you with more mindless grinding.
8290	0	a	I found it boring lel!
8291	0	a	I think its pretty crappy that kids are playing this game on their xbox with a controller and I can't play on my PC with a controller.
8292	0	a	I dont â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing like this game.
8293	0	a	honestly terraria isn't a bad game although it takes a certain kind of person that like this one that can put hours into a game without going no where and then finally getting to that next step you have to be very patient with terraria and can be a great game for a long time and yes this does just seem like a 2d minecraft at first glance after beating the first boss it made me see the game a different way its not a building game its a prep to defeat the big scary â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in eyeball and then the next boss after that but unless you are that kind of person terraria isn't for you but one of my friends told me that the developers hire people to write good reviews which on a quick google search if didn't find any evidence I did however see that they take bad reviews down from YouTube.  http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/just-a-myth-i-heard.102902/   http://www.giantbomb.com/terraria/3030-34940/forums/terraria-developer-cant-take-a-joke-and-hates-fun-497028/  in my opinion if a developer cant take negative critic and go out of there way to remove it they remove all credibility they have even if the review is biased you should let people see it otherwise you are just saying that you are a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ can cant take negative feed back and if people don't tell you that something in your game is bad it wont improve and games that are made after that will probably bad as well which is sad because terraria is a good game and has got a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of content and I also heard that the original developers don't even update the game anymore nor work on the game. (thanks for ruining the image of indie games and this is the kind of stuff that wants to make me pirate games)
8294	0	a	You have to kill me. It makes me sad. Jk would recommend this game to anyone. Really fun and also challenging. 8/10
8295	0	a	I can't really recommend this game. It's basically 2D Minecraft. That's all it is. If you took Minecraft and made it have sex with 2D, you would get Terraria. I know that doesn't make sense. Shut up. I guess if you're tired of Minecraft and love 8-bit graphics this game isn't bad. Personally, I didn't find much to enjoy. Mostly the control scheme is what turns me away. There is definitely a more fluid control scheme that could have been used, or at least implemented as an option. Wonky mouse clicking is sucky. Two thumbs down.

8305	0	a	It's fake, just a prank!
8306	0	a	Ok ok ok....So I got Terrerria about a year ago just so me and my friend could play Multiplyer but guess what? Multiplayer dosen't work. I was quite angry because thats the only thing I wanted to do with the game. Then I said, 'Well I guess singleplayer COULD be worth 10 dollors alone....' But It wasnt. It was the definition of crap. It was a cheap ripoff of Minecraft and the dungion bosses were UNBEATABLE doing 1 hit kills on me when I couldnt see them! Well you would think 'Well this game has a LOT of items.' Well yes it does but half of them are useless, And the other half are hard to get. And you need a crafting table to make these but guess what? When I put down my crafting table and TRY to make stuff it dosent work! Well there you have it. The definition of Terraria.    Edit: Well I tried playing it again and got bored right off it was too hard and I didnt know where to get any items. Everywhere I went I died. So I just quit. Guys beware of terraria DONT BUY IT!!!

8308	0	a	Its laggy minecraft with 120 mods would run better then this. Dont waste your money with this game its a 2d game and you need a super computer to get even 10 fps. I had better time on 3d games filled with mods and on multiplayer. Other then the game being un playable the game play is great.

8312	0	a	'After the end of World War II,   the world was split into two - East and West.   This marked the beginning of the era called the Cold War.'
8313	0	a	This game is pretty much the Battletoads of this decade. A game title so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing profoundly and mind-numbingly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tarded that I'd rather rip out my teeth and gum a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cactus than play this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I've found about as much entertainment with this â™¥â™¥â™¥ wad as I have slamming my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing noggin into a brick wall. If I had to, I'd put it somewhere between Mega Man and individually smashing my fingers with a sledgehammer on the 'fun' meter. I know I've made reviews that were meant to be taken with a grain of salt in the past (I literally have like ONE serious review excluding this one). My reviews are meant to be sarcastic and satirical. But this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game, this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing... I don't even know. A braindead dying walrus could probably design a better game than Re-Logic. Maybe it's just me, hell, it probably IS just me, but don't play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pile of anal discharge. I literally got AIDS the second I installed it.
8314	0	a	Game? Fun? No. Terraria is none of these. This, pathetic excuse for a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game is one of the worst ways I've spent money in basically my entire life. And I bought it hearing 'good' things about it. No. This is pathetic. Wanna play with a friend? Better know how to take apart your computer piece by piece system wise so you can even begin to access part of it. Oh, you thought you could just invite someone to play? NOPE. BECOME A IT SPECIALIST AND THEN WE'LL TALK. Or what about the actual meat and potatoes of this 'game?' Ha. That's pathetic. 2D minecraft my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥. Minecraft is a perfectly executed building simulator that allows you to have full access to amazing tools and build a world that is your own. Terarria is a pathetic little side scroller that doesn't let you have any creative freedom. It's obtuse, roadblocks you anytime you even begin to think you've figured something out, and doesn't even have anything fun about it. If I could get a refund for even just my copy, I'd be thankful. But I can't get a refund for the time I spent trying to figure out this sad, pathetic excuse for a game.

8323	0	a	The only reason why i disliked this is because if you try to mod to have some fun after playing th game it kills you so i shall no longer play the game.
8324	0	a	You will be spending much time building, deconstructing &amp; jumping just to get around. Because there are no slants or much smooth ground, especially after playing a while, it's almost impossible to make a simple walk with enemies out of any journey. It makes a chore out of something only marginally fun once you're doing battle. Why not have any goal being a reasonable travel of time away? Because they need to waste your time with this open world crafting and digging gimmick.  This game has such a low focus on the battles themselves, they are a mess on their own and look so poorly animated. The music is GRATING and I love chiptune! It's just horrible sound choice &amp; the composition doesn't help. I disliked this game so much I hate even seeing it in my library. Is there a way to fix that and drop ownership? I don't need a refund, but that would be better.
8325	0	a	This game is garbage, i do not get the hype about it at all. I feel cheated by the community that hyped this trash  This game would be ok for a small child or someone with mental disabilities

The game is good, items are good, textures and music are good, but the game itself? eh, don't waste your money. Get Starbound. Way better (Again, not because i played it first. If you think that's why, don't.).  The controls are confusing no matter what you set them to, you have to look at your inventory just to exit out, you cant exit the game using that big red x at the top, you start out with crappy weapons and mining is slow, you cant see AT ALL at night unless you have a torch, you cant defend yourself from monsters that are flying at the beginning, takes forever just to respawn, you cant do much at first, you don't see how much of a block you mined, the pickaxe is a better weapon than the sword, and the biomes make no sense. there is literally a block inbetween biomes.  If you want this game, go ahead. It's fine, but i would recommend Starbound (YOU SERIOUSLY THINK I WROTE THIS SINCE I PLAYED STARBOUND FIRST!? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?)
8330	0	a	If you build a house they will rave in it

8343	0	a	During the year of 2014 my best friend was going to Sierra Leone to aid those who had gotten their whole life destroyed because of the horrible virus that is ebola. I really wanted to go with him but unfortionatly I had other things to take care of at home. On his journey he got to meet all sorts of people from poor, hungry children to happy tribesfolk. But there was one thing they all had in common, they where all sick. Only a couple of days before his journey back home my best friend made the horrible discovery that he had also been affected by the virus and he would not be able to make it. His fate had been decided, he were to die. My heart broke when I heard of the news an yet there was nothing I could do about it. After the incident my mother has repetitivly reminded me of how lucky I was that I wasn't able to go with my friend. Yet I still strongly regret not doing so, because this game gave me ebola anyway.

Well then Terraria is perfect for you, expierence a sordid game that transcribes it's thoughts not only into a written form through it's inviting and exciting 1992 direct IP connection feature, but it also holds your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by making a game that allows you the player to do all the work. Make a house, masturbate, die, or hit rocks and build another house! You name it Terraria has it and its an atrocious 8bit nightmare I sure do love 8bit, the retro sylings go great with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up IP connect. Do you have a PC that is older than the first troglodyte to create fire? Then this game is perfect for you otherwise I'd reccomend you play a real game like I dunno Call of Dogs: Black Ghost. 1 out of 10
8353	0	a	Like a hand in rushing water, a cool and tangible surface, like a hand out a car window, the wind controlling its movement, like a hand upon green grass, as you watch it bend in softness, like a hand touching fire, every moment leaves a mark, like a hand in the frozen snow, your warmth could melt it all,  gently, slowly, specifically, all detail matters, and every inch is art, I could tell you about a reason, to love a moment like this, but its better left, unsaid,  for a touch is worth a thousand words, and pictures just donâ€™t matter anymore, for only a memory of your touch, can bring that look to her face, and that longing, to her eyes.
8354	0	a	Can't wait for people to dislike this automatically. BRING ON THE HATE, I HAVE AN OPINION.  Terraria is interesting, to say the most. It has more charm than minecraft, but like minecraft, it's boredom central. Oh, yes, there are plenty of things to do, but holding down the mouse for two hours to end up attacking the occasional zombie that crosses your path just to mine again gets so boring. I suppose multiplayer is more hectic and livelier, but the single player is very dull. It's a very good time waster, I'll give it that; when waiting for things to happen to me in real life I might play this for a bit, as it certainly distracts you from things, but it's just not something I want to play all the time.  My problem is not the graphics (although pixel based games are oversaturating the market) and it's not the sound (which sounds boring, but gets the job done). It's just the gameplay; Minecraft and this game share a lot of the same problems; HOWEVER, Terraria has way better combat than Minecraft, and it's NPC's are better as well; they have actual pathfinding, unlike Minecraft, in which enemies simply walk in a straight line toward you. Crafting is weird, and I have to say it is better and worse than Minecraft; it tells you what you need for an item from the getgo, but the way you craft seems unweildy (having to press esc and scroll through a very small menu at the bottom left).  All in all, I had more fun with this than Minecraft, but I still didn't have a lot of it. It's probably worth it to every single other person other than me, but it just isn't my thing.  BUT HEY, $1.99 ON SALE, CAN'T BEAAAAAAT THAT!  pickaxe/10.
8355	0	a	This game is extremely unstable. What the requirements don't tell you is you need an up to date version of .Net Framework (4.0 or higher), XNA Game Studio, and it's operation is dependent on your Sound Card's sound set. APPROACH WITH EXTREME CAUTION!
8356	0	a	This game is crap. It is basicly Taco Bell with the same price and quality. There is nothing to do and its over complicated. The 2D graphics make it unbareable to play and dont get me started on the fighting. They add in 'fighting' mechanics but its absolute trash from the start. Just click and hold. The AI also stinks and you just place a block then your safe. Overall, this game is just crap and NEVER buy it. The only reason this is in the runing for an award is becasue of the annoying minecraft kids that buy horrible merch for this game. Terraria is the litteraly Donald Trump of steam. Game = Trash
8357	0	a	Minecraft is in 3d, and because terreria is in 2d, its a terrible game. THATS 1D WERE MISSING GUYS!!!!!!
8358	0	a	My only problem with this almost problemless game is i pay 9.99 plus tax out of my money to enjoy this game but as i played i finally made it into hardmode...The next day nostalgic i get on my pc and TRY to load the world and it crashes the game every time multiple times i tried everything Thank you A Terraria DV's for a game i put alot of time into and get nothing out of it.

8362	0	a	I could only play for a bit because it got boring...   EDIT: its a joke people stop looking at the reviews and buy it lads
8363	0	a	I have been playing this game since 2011, and it's always getting better. I will say, terraria is much better when playing with friends But here is when I'm angry THERE IS ALWAYS A F***ING PROBLEM WHEN TRYING TO JOIN OR START A SERVER TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS.  'Oh well it works for most players' 'Oh so you change your router port and port forward' EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE THE SAME POST TO F*CKING CHANGE SOMETHING OR LITERALLY BREAK THE GAME OR YOUR ROUTER I RESET MY ENTIRE F*CKING COMPUTER TO REINSTALL SOME MICROSOFT FRAMEWORK S**T  'What are you talking about? There was a new update that lets you join players via steam' OH WELL THAT LITERALLY NOTHING EITHER THE SERVERS WORKED UNTIL THESE USELESS UPDATES THAT ADD LITERALLY 5 ITEMS PER UPDATE SO IF YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS AND WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME, USE YOUR $10 DOLLARS FOR THIS PIECE OF SH*T
8364	0	a	Fun for the first few hours, then gets boring, after that point you will only play the game with friends when you are bored, 2D mining was not a good topic for this game.
8365	0	a	0/10 This game is a Dumb minecraft rip off and is basicly the same game execpt this is an indie game
8366	0	a	You can't even swim. What the hell
8367	0	a	Truthfully? I don't get this game, I found it to be kind of boring and hard to pick-up. The lack of a server browser is what really kills it for me, it's on Steam, why is there no matchmaking? It might be different with single player, but I'm probably not going to try it on single player, if I ever do play it I guarantee I'll be using Skype and Hamachi in conjunction with it to let whomever else I'm playing with know that I 'HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THE HELL I'M SUPPOSED TO DO'. The combat is rather difficult, it's not uncommon that you take as many hits as you deal out, and then the crafting system. It's impossible without having an internet browser in the background for first-timers But it doesn't come without it's pros, unlike it's 3D counterpart Minecraft it focuses more on adventuring and exploration rather than digging a hole and building giant monuments. And it's a reasonably small filesize, less than 20MB.
8368	0	a	Its a piece of trash
8369	0	a	This game is BAD! I bought it because it was only a dollar but i still feel like this game was a waste of money. I played this game for a couple of minutes and it has already given me cancer. This game, quitefrankly, is a cheap 2D crappy version of minecraft. If you want a good version of this game buy minecraft. Much better and more fun.
8370	0	a	Just hopping into the negative review bandwagon to tell you to go back to the positive section.  EDIT: updated so i get a free steam badge
8371	0	a	Terraria is like the more bestest game i mefv played in my lifed. Pls buy the game is it 10/9 yes.
8372	0	a	some white kid pronounced it tea-aria, since you somehow made this possible, im giving a negative review
8373	0	a	honestly, buy starbound instead.
8374	0	a	Gaem sux bull â™¥â™¥â™¥\  Jk i love this game
8375	0	a	Really thius game is good but crap at the same time, its good if u want to have fun and run around and kill stuff with OP tools, But crap because theres a problem that if u join a server and the person on the server gives u good loot if u try to play that person u can so im givin this game a bad review after i collected so much good loot like a sandstorm in a bottle and magical fricn daggers and they did 51 damage, so this game is crap but some what good
8376	0	a	Ok now i liked it BUT something â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ came AGAIN.I cant even join anyone beacause it allways says connecting to.FFS Terraria nothing is right on this game.If you are gonna play with friends on the game i dont recommend this its just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up with online things.And this happend in 2.X.X.X Too ffs.

8380	0	a	Terraria is a land of adventure! A land of mystery! A land that's yours to shape, to defend and to enjoy. Your options in Terraria are limitless. Are you an action gamer with an itchy trigger finger? A master builder? A collector? An explorer? There's something for everyone here. Play it now on PC, Xbox 360, PS3, PS Vita, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone!      Its Bad         Really Bad          Unless you like minecraft          Combined with Mario      
8381	0	a	It wont let me play the game when i just got it for 10$ now I have to download a bunch on crap after minecraft.  
8382	0	a	this is a boring game dont buy it
8383	0	a	A good game. No graphics or lag flaws, or anything like that. I had no problems for about 250 hours.    But then, it happened. I beat the game. The final boss, Cthulu. So, I made a new character, but after you've done everything you can with the game, it gets [bold] BORINGGG. [/bold] I had already got all the items but a few. I had beat all the bosses. There was nothing left to do. Its a good game for a while, but then it's just not worth it anymore. Get it when it's on sale. Trust me. Patience is key.
8384	0	a	game sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8385	0	a	It's great.
8386	0	a	Eh, I cant say its as good as everyone says. Its okay with friends but not anything special. Minecraft was way better.  When I'm extremely bored, this is somewhat fun.  3/10

8393	0	a	I believe this game is garbage because how kidish the whole game is with a on going minecraft feel (despite 2D pixel graphics). The graphics are bland and the game is generally boring. This game might appeal to 12 year olds or man babies tho not me. My ovarall score is 2/10. (Its not my type of game). One more thing is that is is really overrated so, go buy age of empires (Factorio is good too) or some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off fanboys this review is made 4 people looking to buy the game not for you to b annoying.
8394	0	a	  haha i pirated this game and then got it for free
8395	0	a	A painfully average game that wants to do everything without doing any of it well.
8396	0	a	Cool idea but didn't work that well and tough to learn.
8397	0	a	I dont really like terraria and here are the reasons why: there is no tutorial, game is to expensive for a game that was moved from a mobile to pc, multiplayer sucks and it has such a small download. This is basically like a kiddie minecraft game but the cheap version.
8398	0	a	so after dying to get this game that has over 60k positive reviews suddenly i find it gay, maybe its not my type or i still dont know whats the point of it !
8399	0	a	It's really funny at first but it startes to suck after a couple hours. Wasn't really worth the money. Get other, better games. 3/10 would not waste my time again
8400	0	a	When i try to open Terraria it just says 'Terraria has stopped working' and then it closes. Is there a way so i can get a refund? Thanks
8401	0	a	BUAHAHAHAHAAHA IM THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WHO DISLIKED TERRARIA jk this game is amazing the dislike is only a troll

8403	0	a	Pointless. Stupid. Just play minecraft with tweens.
8404	0	a	made a house, thats about it
8405	0	a	This game has AWFUL load times, and I'm running it on a Titan 1980x, 2 TB of harddrive space and struggle to get 1-2 FPS. I wouldn't even recommend this to anyone on the spectrum.
8406	0	a	You can throw your money down the toilet, which makes more sense.  1/10
8407	0	a	Just really not my type of game. I thought that it would be worth it to just try it out, but honestly I shouldve went w my gut and avoided it  EDIT: Wow, people really weren't happy with my review. Maybe if I put it in a more reasonable way: I had gone into to this game apprhensive, knowing that I dont like games such as Minecraft. I decided to give it a chance anyways just because of the great reviews &amp; my friends who love it. But if someone doesn't like beef, it doesn't matter how great the steak is. They just won't like it.

8409	0	a	Co-op is very hard to set up. 0/10 IGN.
8410	0	a	This game is alright, it get's boring after awhile. The first time you fight it's hard, but when you get better gear then it's like there really is no challenge at all. The bosses are cruddy and really easy to fight. The only thing I like is the multiplayer mode, that still get's boring. Even with MODS, this game doesn't amuse me. So what this game have more crafting recipes, it's just pointless stuff. I think this game could have been better if it was 3D , because the fighting stinks in 2D, it's just hit, wait hit, wait hit, wait, dead! At least in Mincraft you have to worry about 3 dimensions. . Switching Softcore to mediumcore doesn't change a thing, it only changes what you drop. I think this game isn't worth ten bucks. Why don't every sad little troll who owns this game get Minecraft? I think their to stubborn to admit that this game is a piece of garbo ( compared to Minecraft) but I do like is the equipment, I'll give them that, it's still limited in 2D.
8411	0	a	ripped off starbound 1/10 for effort atleast
8412	0	a	i cant play the 1.3 version because it requires a better graphic card and the cheapest that works fo i could find was Â£100.
8413	0	a	  its mincraft
8414	0	a	Spawned in a new world...first time playing...after speaking with the help guy twice, a giant bee called Stinger attacked me and i died. It continued to attack me 46 more times...sorry, but I'm not even going to give this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a second chance. There's a lot better/nicer/smoother games out there that don't spawn a boss on you in the first eleven secodns of the game.
8415	0	a	Terraria is disgusting. A game made of pixels that isn't really fun. Pretty bland and stale so I wouldn't recommend unless your a little kid or into these disgraces of a game. I've prepared myself for the dumb fan boys to leave dislikes and rude comments because Terraria is their only life. Rate 3/10 Rank Bad
8416	0	a	I always loved terraria but when i recently went on, i lost my dude with hallowed amour, wings and a terra blade. SOOOOOOO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OFF
8417	0	a	This is a really good game and I highly recommend it.
8418	0	a	Guys you should listen to this and stop blowing him off. The graphics in this game are high quality compared to the last one. If you are a noob then i suggest getting this game because noobs find this game more fun like a 6/10 man its like when your a little kid and things seem bigger but i mean pros it like when you grow up and things r kindaa smaller so if you want i guess just by advanced warfare if u r good but if u r a noob at pc gaming then just buy this cause it will seem cooler so over all i would give this review a 9/10 and stop blowing him off guys but this game gets boring kinda fast its basiclly a dlc to the original that came out last year so over 9.5/10 buy this game just be careful because when you are playing on line lik this time some guy hacked money out of my pay pal account so i would just download an anti virus so just buy kasperski or super anti spyware but i would actually suggest avast because it works i would probobly give it a 4/10 compared to all of the other anti viruses for pc. One complante i have is that the crafting is not as good as it is in casle miner z. i mean why would it not be as good. in casle miner z you can make many items like guns and shovels and in minecraft you can make jukeboxes and in skyrim you can make Dragon Armor and these factors are not in the binding of isacc which really dissapoints me. Also i cant seem to find the first person mode that was in the last game or maybbe im thinking of another game. idk. well you might be asking what if im not a noob or a pro, what game should i get, well i would suggest getting the dlc for the original and just playing that be my friend free ds is an average gamer and he loves that so i would just get that guys okkk? ok!!!!!!!!! Some of you guys might think that cod ghosts is the game you should get but it isnt. Now i really really love the graphics in this game as Ford F150 4x4 XLT Texas Edition. They show much improvement from the original but they are not as good as the graphics in the original. Most of you will call me stupid but im pretty sure i have a good understanding of what im talking about because i have a assosiates degree in Graphic Desighn from the career halmark college and i have published a few apps on the amazon app store so im pretty sure i know all about graphics. So in conclussion i would stick to the original game for one simple reason. the money. this game is FIFTEEN DOLLARS while the original is only five and goes on sale a lot like it will probobly go on sale this week so i would just stivk that one and buy the dlc and if you get bored you can just get a job and save some money to buy the pre sequal which is only 60$ and it a complely new inovation unlike this crappy game. So all in all i would just abondon the terraria series and move on yall cauese its like almost 2015 and our generation is moving in more futuristic games like Borderlands the Pre Sequal. Im going to tie back to my original point and say that saving your allowence and buying the pre sequal is the best and i would give this idea an 8.5/10 and the game an 8/10. So just remember to play safe and that graphics are not the only thing in a game i mean just look at Battlefied 4. The graphics are not that grate but the game is still pretty cool because it looks nice. Just remember to buy a good anti virus when you play online because of the hackers and common guys Ford F-150 4x4 XLT Texas Edition deserves a little bit more then 3% support so lets help him but this is just a better version of his comment if you have any comment or questions, instagram me @ckasper77788. have a good thanks giving.
8419	0	a	It really isn't worth your money, as the last update hardly added anything for new players and only caitered to the old ones that spent time grinding their way through the tedious garbage that is this game's midgame.  Don't buy it.

8427	0	a	Well, it may be an awesome game with great fun. Yes, I thought it should be. But saddly I got stuck at the very beginning. The very beginning... :( Really dont know what to do with it. Can my guide talk? He even died for quite some times before I managed to figured out the meaning of his exsistence... So, maybe I'll get back later with some knowledge. :(
8428	0	a	If you like making out with little boys then you should play this game. It's amazing. What's even more amazing is downloading a map with all the items on it and never playing it...EVER AGAIN.
8429	0	a	Doesnt work. When I try to open the game, it doesnt open, but for like 5 secons it'll say to all my friends I'm playing it. Can anyone help fix?

8431	0	a	I got this game for Â£6.99, Â£6.99! For what? I play and get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by zombies then some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing eye cums all over my face and kills me. My friend makes a house but some homeless guy steals the thing called jeff the killer of house manners. Fudge this game. AFTER ALL OF THAT I MAKE MY OWN HOUSE AND MY FRIEND COMES ALONG AND STEALS ME CHESTS ME GOLDEN CHEST. 0/10
8432	0	a	Good game but have to say no because I wanted to play multiplayer. A few friends and I have spent hours on one of us trying to host the server and followed multiple tutorials without even coming close to playing this game together. They should have made it simpler to play multiplayer. The 'Host and Play' does NOT work.
8433	0	a	it's a good game, but for whatever reason, i could never really get into it.
8434	0	a	After 300 hours, this is the worst Left 4 Dead copy I've ever seen. 0/10
8435	0	a	Terraria is one of the first games I got on steam. But i don't play it much anymore.  Terraria was a fun game when I played it but after I purchased the game 'minecraft' it got a little dull. Yes, terraria has some stuff in it which minecraft doesn't have such as guns. But once you get certain weapons on a character, you basically just won the game since when you start a new world. You're character's items and gear transfer over to the new world.  Multiplayer is fun-ish because when you slay a boss, someone can come in a jack your stuff and you can't do anything about it.  Terraria in my opinion wasn't worth the pickup.  Note: This is my opinion and I know people out there like this game but I just didn't enjoy it
8436	0	a	trying too hard to be roblox
8437	0	a	I do not like this game at all. I want a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!
8438	0	a	Possibly one of the worst games I've ever had the misfortune of playing. It is a pale imitation of an unsuccessful product, a blurry image photocopied through a printer with no ink. Not a single asset is original, not a single idea unique or noteworthy. Though it is absolutely overloaded with systems, not a single one functions in any way that could be perceived as fun or engaging. This is a product sold through subversion and trickery. It does not succeed on its own merits, only through suggesting an experience much grander than it can deliver. This is a product that could not have possibly succeeded in any time other than now, any place other than here. Decades of technological advancement have created the ideal environment for complete and utter failures of game design like Terraria to thrive. A person could play this game for hundreds of hours, constantly believing that within the next few minutes, every disparate, poorly realized element will come together into some beautiful whole, some masterpiece that justifies the time and money spent on it by the developers and players. This review serves as a warning: that moment will never come. If Terraria represents where video games are going, I'd suggesting finding a new hobby.   Also, I kept getting recommened Minecraft clones, so I throught downvoting this game might tell Steam's algorithm that I don't want to put up with this anymore.
8439	0	a	As a fan of Minecraft since the Alpha stages, I thought Terraria could be a bit of fun. I was very wrong. Bad controls, graphics that are more childish than charming, and linear gameplay make Terraria pale in comparison to Minecraft.
8440	0	a	Weird game... It has a really really strange atmosphere and a quite annoying system to mine, craft or build something. It's more a point &amp; click game than a survival /crafting game...   Better stay with Minecraft!  
8441	0	a	I don't get why people like this game? xD
8442	0	a	Okay game. Worth $2.50.
8443	0	a	I'm serious when I say this is one of the worst games i've ever played. I don't know why people like it, I won't question their judgement, but I am going to question a lot about this games design, because it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is fascinating.  +Easy to pick up on +Social game better played with friends +Alright boss fights  -A shamefully obvious attempt to jump on Minecraft's bandwagon -Published by 505 games, the company responsible for banning users from its forums for criticism and the second game ever to be recalled after release. -Super â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing easy, getting end-game gear is as easy as finding a floating island and building your way up to the top. Chances are you'll find adamantite and angel wings. Now you're set to do absolutely nothing for a few hours.  -End game can be reached super quickly, and there's nothing to do afterwards. Minecraft may be pointless to play beyond slaying the dragon or whatever, but here there's no real objective. In Minecraft you could set your own objectives, build your own cool-looking 3d â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but the 2d limits this game in that regard. -Better flash games online. Free flash games. Y'know... the kind you play in your BROWSER! -Map generation is incredibly limited, biomes aren't interesting at all. -The soundtrack is probably one of the worst. It's practically the same two songs and it seriously felt like a hot drill was being put to my head after about 20 minutes of listening to it. -No dedicated multiplayer servers -No matter how you die, you explode. This means you can fall a couple of feet at low health and you still turn into a mess of gore. It's funny if anything besides â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid. -Water is annoying and cannot be traversed without flippers. Wouldn't be so bad if it weren't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing everywhere, and if you didn't have to chance to drown in a seriously difficult boss fight just because you can't get out. -Combat is pitiful. Nearly every weapons swings in a complete circle, which makes combat rediculously easy. Ranged combat is hardly ever used outside of bosses and is just a simple point and shoot.  -2d perspective limits creativity.   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Don't really care what people think about me saying that, but I say it with the utmost confidence. 2/10

Minecraft may be pointless to play beyond slaying the dragon or whatever, but here there's no real objective. In Minecraft you could set your own objectives, build your own cool-looking 3d â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but the 2d limits this game in that regard. -Better flash games online. Free flash games. Y'know... the kind you play in your BROWSER! -Map generation is incredibly limited, biomes aren't interesting at all. -The soundtrack is probably one of the worst. It's practically the same two songs and it seriously felt like a hot drill was being put to my head after about 20 minutes of listening to it. -No dedicated multiplayer servers -No matter how you die, you explode. This means you can fall a couple of feet at low health and you still turn into a mess of gore. It's funny if anything besides â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid. -Water is annoying and cannot be traversed without flippers. Wouldn't be so bad if it weren't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing everywhere, and if you didn't have to chance to drown in a seriously difficult boss fight just because you can't get out. -Combat is pitiful. Nearly every weapons swings in a complete circle, which makes combat rediculously easy. Ranged combat is hardly ever used outside of bosses and is just a simple point and shoot.  -2d perspective limits creativity.   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. Don't really care what people think about me saying that, but I say it with the utmost confidence. 2/10

8455	0	a	F*cked up and boring after 3 minutes NOT WORTH $10
8456	0	a	General Review:  This game is a pile of crap.  Pros:  -The advertising campaign -The fact that they sold more than one copy of this game  Cons:  -Controls are messy -Crafting is messy -Stay alive would be hard for Gandhi with all his patience   What could they do to make it better?  -Rewrite the entire crafting mechanic system -Fix the control system -Provide better explanation for first time players
8457	0	a	Just 2d minecraft, didn't find anything special about it you're better off with starbound since theres so much more to do
8458	0	a	3rd try to start playing. While I'm figuring out how to build a wall, the night came and everything I see it's a mouse cursor and I hear some one are biting me. So much fun.
8459	0	a	This is an awesome game. I play it a lot. I have an issue right now though. I clicked on my terraria game and started up a world. About five seconds later it popped up that says A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available. It's been like that for like two days now and im getting worried. For that I am putting a thumbs down.
8460	0	a	I just simply never liked it &amp; never will , its the most simplistic &amp; boring gameplay you'll see.  For 9.99 you can get better games like FEZ or Rayman Origins (Rayman origins has no uplay DRM!)
8461	0	a	Why you hating? You just don't know how to play, so shut up and buy this game
8462	0	a	OMG GUYZ THEREZ BLOCKS IN DIS GAME!!!!!!! ITZ A MINECRAFT RIP OFF!!!!!!! IF THERZ BLOCKS IN A GAME, IT MAKES IT A MINECRAFT RIP OFF! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MOJANG HAS TO HEAR ABOUT THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
8463	0	a	Too many r's in the title  0/10 worst game
8464	0	a	17:22 - PÎ»Â³TRiCiA åŽ¶ VAMPYRE: maybe its fun on tablet 17:22 - Abronsius: no fun on pc? 17:23 - PÎ»Â³TRiCiA åŽ¶ VAMPYRE: f-ck no 17:23 - PÎ»Â³TRiCiA åŽ¶ VAMPYRE: lol
8465	0	a	I love the Creepers.
8466	0	a	Terrible graphics. I can barely tell what anything is. I get it's a type of art style but it's too pixelated. Too distorted. The controls are horribly awkward and the 2 dimensional gameplay is terribly awkward also. It's difficult overall to manage. It took me a while to figure out what the heck was attacking me. 0/10.
8467	0	a	  Positives: Crafting Pixelated  Negatives: Hard to Get Materials Early on Not Fun Annoying Music TOO OP Monsters (40 Minutes In: 32 Damage) Coins Weaponary
8468	0	a	No, no, no; i dunno what it is about this game i just dont like it, my opinion!
8469	0	a	Minecraft is in 3D.. Go play that instead.
8470	0	a	This game is a big No... Brainer buy it
8471	0	a	At least I got it cheap
8472	0	a	Gets boring after two minutes. 3/10.
8473	0	a	hey whats up guys its scarce hereand here 
8474	0	a	this sucks do not get it is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8475	0	a	almost perfect but i don;t know why you still dont provide Chinese version !!!!
8476	0	a	I thought this game would be like Craft the World or Minecraft or something but it's much worse. I don't really care about paying $10 or $20 or whatever I paid for this game but the reality is the game isn't that good. The graphics don't scale well if you have a high resolution display, the main character and icons are tiny, ok. Second, the gameplay isn't that great. Feels very alpha quality. That being said if you don't expect much or haven't played better games then maybe you can enjoy it. Thank you for reading.
8477	0	a	People go mostly fangay when you say anything about how this game is boring, when it IS boring when you play it alone. Same general mechanics like in Minecraft. Harvest in the day, hide at night if you aren't ready to take on the monsters. Rinse and repeat adinfinitum. Once you get stronger, or use a mod to boost yourself, you get to go 'raid' as they put it. Killing bosses for their loot. But as said, doing all this is as boring as playing Minecraft alone, unless you are using Minecraft to hand build worlds, statues and whatnot which you can't really do in this.
8478	0	a	Do not buy this extremely boring! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
8479	0	a	this game lacks replayability
8480	0	a	i don't play this game anymore. it got to complicated. it's like 2d minecraft but more focused on the adventuring then the mining or crafting.
8481	0	a	I don't know in which category to post this, but for all the people who are saying that it's crashing, from what i noticed, it's only people who used a key to activate the game, also, there is a steam cloud feature to maybe help you out. BUT SERIOUSLY, THE GAME WILL NOT WORK MOSTLY ONLY IF YOU USED A KEY FOR IT
8482	0	a	Bad controls clunky interface awful combat. Terrible game waste of money
8483	0	a	Starbound ripoff
8484	0	a	make it free plz :^) 
8485	0	a	Terraria is the most overated crapy game over apart from undertale. Its a minecraft rip off and its certianly not fun. 1.5/10
8486	0	a	Game won't run anymore and I can't get any help from Steam Support.....I can't even re-download the game and do a reinstall
8487	0	a	minecraft ripoff. not even a good ripoff either. anyone who has played this game for more than one hour should be killed to death
8488	0	a	This game is as gud az a grape on the ground
8489	0	a	its complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.... this game resembles to the gameplay of minecrÃ¤ft
8490	0	a	Pure T mouth-full-of-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ garbage.
8491	0	a	minecraft ripoff
8492	0	a	Built a giant sign that said nerdraria.
8493	0	a	minecraft ripoff
8494	0	a	I wish this game was fun. I really do. But it isn't. It's tedious, and the crafting is the least intuitive thing I have ever experienced. Even quitting the game isn't intuitive. When I want out, I shouldn't have to go three menus deep, I should be able to hit the X in the corner and wash my hands of the experience. If I had to dig up something positive to say, I guess that it's visually pretty cute while you're being murdered by slime and trying to figure out what a wall does or how to place a door.  This game does not even remotely live up to its hype.
8495	0	a	What the hell are you looking in the negative reviews for? This game is one of the best 10 bucks you'll ever spend!
8496	0	a	Ok so just started had one of my friends who play terraria sitting next to me, (because the game does not have a tutorial) im getting in to it finally have a weapon that can hurt a zombie. I'm feeling good, found loot found cash, even had a travelling merchant come by. Finally learnt how to build properly, Everythings great. (if your wondering why this is in the negative section ill get to that) I spent not ages but awhile playing the game. 30 hrs in and now i have killed every boss (not all the event bosses o and i had help) then it goes down hill, this is when fishing became a thing, log in planning to bring the ocean to the bottom of the world only to find my world isnt there, it sucked but i was like MEH, did as i planned and then had no more ideas. It got boring, more boring then trying to level up in HALO REACH, i quit for awhile playing starbound and come back and its hard to compare the two games, at 20$ in terraria you got a tiny world with no tutorial which was also considered finished then starbound pre 1. you get a whole galxy an intr a tutorial now its 1. u get a guided campaign multiplayer steam mods and different biomes other then grass jungle and desert if you want to buy an awesome game get starbound not terraria, if you read this your cool and deserve a cookie. but i spent 20$ on terraria so i cant go and buy you a cookie
8497	0	a	THIS GAME, I LOVE IT PIECES AND HATE SO MUCH BECAUSE EVERY FLIPPIN TIME I BINGE PLAY IT THEN STAHP FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME EVERYTHING GOES OF AND DELETES ITSELF LIKE HILARIES EMAILS SO MEH/10 WOULD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ SLAP AGAIN
8498	0	a	Just play Minecraft instead.
8499	0	a	1) World saves normally corrupt 2) Character saves normally corrupt 3) You have to spend hours of your time to do things that evenually corrupt/become useless
8500	0	a	I like Minecraft, but never got to like this game, tried playing it more than 5 times, but just can't seem to get to like it.  It sucks. =/
8501	0	a	this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me and than spat on my shiny â™¥â™¥â™¥, do not buy
8502	0	a	Don't buy into the idea that this game is similar to minecraft or starbound, all three games have much less alike than most people think. I personally think this is less fun than minecraft by a long shot. (I don't have starbound.) Probably the only reason I still play it at all is because most of my friends think the exact opposite. In fact they're all playing this game right now.
8503	0	a	Awesome Game Played For 3 Months , Then One Day Lost All Proggress !
8504	0	a	DONT BUY THE GAME TRUST ME I NOW HAVE NO LIFE. IT IS SO ADDICTING. IT WILL SUCK YOU IN!

8511	0	a	I chose the Negative because I like the color red, this game rocks :) 10/10
8512	0	a	This game is like minecraft, but 2D and not as good.

8514	0	a	Oh man...words cannot express what happened to me after eating these. The Gummi Bear 'Cleanse'. If you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute, enjoy. If you are like the dozens of people that tried my order, RUN!  First of all, for taste I would rate these a 5. So good. Soft, true-to-taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety...I was a happy camper.  BUT (or should I say BUTT), not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose. I had a gastrointestinal experience like nothing I've ever imagined. Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare. I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.  Then came the, uh, flatulence. Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited. I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.  But wait; there's more. What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw. I swear my sphincters were screaming. It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste. 100% liquid. Flammable liquid. NAPALM. It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond)as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.  AND IT WENT ON FOR HOURS.  I felt violated when it was over, which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day. There was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding in 2005.  I had FIVE POUNDS of these innocent-looking delicious-tasting HELLBEARS so I told a friend about what happened to me, thinking it HAD to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute, and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions, she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands.  Silly woman. All of the same for her, and a phone call from her while on the toilet (because you kinda end up living in the bathroom for a spell) telling me she really wished she would have listened. I think she was crying.  Her sister was skeptical and suspected that we were exaggerating. She took them to work, since there was still 99% of a 5 pound bag left. She works for a construction company, where there are builders, roofers, house painters, landscapers, etc. Lots of people who generally have limited access to toilets on a given day. I can't imagine where all of those poor men (and women) pooped that day. I keep envisioning men on roofs, crossing their legs and trying to decide if they can make it down the ladder, or if they should just jump.  If you order these, best of luck to you. And please, don't post a video review during the aftershocks.  PS: When I ordered these, the warnings and disclaimers and legalese were NOT posted. I'm not a moron. Also, not sure why so many people assume I'm a man. I am a woman. We poop too. Of course, our poop sparkles and smells like a walk in a meadow of wildflowers. Thanks for all the great comments. I've been enjoying reading them and so glad that the horror show I experienced from snacking on these has at least made some people smile.
8515	0	a	Game Has stopped working about 2 years ago, Whenever I would load the game, it would crash before even the click to play screen, leaving a white screen, and after a short time would show a 'terraria is not responding' message. I do NOT recommend this game until it has been fixed as you may recieve this issue as well and waste your money.
8516	0	a	Overwhelming Rating aside 0/10 on the super fun factor scale. (I'm pretty sure most reviewers just got this game from their friends because they are too poor to buy their own games)  What!? You got this game from a kind rich friend on the 75% discount days!? So you decided to leave silly reviews about how superior this game is to everything else!? *Gasps* My word...  Music is... *Gags* Boring, Ugly UI, Ugly Pixels design hooman race? more like poomans.  Just drop me into a boring bland world!? Ugh!  Starbound: Beautiful Music, UI, Skills, Weapons, Bosses, Interstaller space travel, multiple multiple infinite worlds, Fun. I honestly prefer starbound over this inferior trash (Shots fired) at least chuckle fish did things right even if they 'Copied' Terraria, well Terraria copied super mario an made it even worse! It's pixel it's all the same to me. *Nod*  Sure I didn't play 400+ hours of this game why? Because I have better things to play. Sure port forward an play with friends, but that is still bland asf.  My review summed up: I bought it, I gave it a chance.  If you're looking for some super awesome game go play Starbound not MicroSoftCraft or Terraria.
8517	0	a	ITS A MEME U DIP 
8518	0	a	you must have had a rough relationship with your father if you enjoy playing thisgame
8519	0	a	Fun at first, killing the pre-hard bosses and everything, but once you get to hardcore worlds, its almost impossible to move up in armor since your dying every five seconds by some door opening monster! The health of the hardmode enemies is ridiculous, and the damage is as much as a pre-hardmode boss for one monster!
8520	0	a	not my cup of tea
8521	0	a	it wont let me load cause of the graphics to much graphics 
8522	0	a	THIS GAME TAKES AWAY YOUR LIFE!!!  DONT BUY IT... EVER!!!!  
8523	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up my afternoon by trying to join my sister in a game, just impossible, Ip adresses&amp; port are not given in game, but you have to work with that, so check yourself, and try, again and again, don't get how it has been developped, but I think it was with a potato...  (also, why isn't there a menu to go back to the welcome page of the game, once you can play on a server? seriously, how can you forget that...) I do not recommend that potato-developped game.
8524	0	a	this game is the most dumbest game do not buy this u cant get online and it doesnt let u build on single player
8525	0	a	eh useless company waste my money i buy it at 3.15 cents uh useless now 1.15 i â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your mother knn you think money come from tree isit knn useless game srsly i â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your mother recommend this game i dont even think anyone wan to play its to useless alr
8526	0	a	the problem about this game is that you cant play **** multiplayer
8527	0	a	I bought this game because it looked fun, and I had never really done the 'sandbox' thing before (it was also on sale at the time, so for a few bucks why not?). It was interesting for awhile, and I could see myself getting pretty involved (build a tower to space? WHY NOT), but ultimately this game left me feeling frustrated.  For one thing, the guide in the beginning is not as helpful as he thinks he is. Besides some basic hints and facts, I had very little idea of what I was doing. It was only after looking up a tutorial that I finally figured out how to build a house and not die constantly.  Which brings me to my main grievance: I vastly underestimated the amount of monsters in this game. While I accepted them to be a thing at night, during the day they were almost as unavoidable. It would be pretty annoying to have to stop whatever I was doing just to keep the slimes off my back. And if I wanted to explore the adjacent landscapes? Instantly attacked by new (and stronger) monsters. Also if it's nighttime and there is an open flat space, zombies are guaranteed to spawn no matter where you are. Even in space.  These are my current hangups, and it's bothered me enough that I'm not going to play for awhile, but in the end it's just my personal preference. I'd probably be less frustrated if I could deal with the monsters on my own terms, rather than having to constatntly watch my back. I may open it up again in the future, but for now this just isn't for me.

8530	0	a	Please don't hate me for saying this. I do not really enjoy this game that much. I just can't get into it, I'm sure if I actually tried to do the stuff I would most likely love it. But, Alas, I do not want to spend the time on it.
8531	0	a	It is awsome but the good mods like omnirs and necro pack need to be updated and keeps crashing! have a fix tell me
8532	0	a	I didn't feel like scavenging for hours to find one mineral only to craft a sword.
8533	0	a	Much like Minecraft, I simply don't 'get' this. Do not recommend for those who like to dive right in with things
8534	0	a	You can very easily get this game free. Not my personal favorite, but it seems a lot of people enjoy it, so it's not like you have much reason not to try it.
8535	0	a	For the price of $2.00 this is a neat little game. I wouldnt call it much of a deal at the regular price of $10.00 sorry to say. Take a look at Starbound, it is a much prettier version of this game, but Terraria has much more depth. If the develpoers of Starbound didnt give up on the game, so many paid into, it could put this game to shame. So its a toss up on what one i like more. Ill have to play this one a bit more to make up my mine.  Apon firther testing i do not recommend this game. It just dont live up to the rest of the games it has to compete with.
8536	0	a	Meh, fun until you find that one exploting server thatg ruins everything.
8537	0	a	I got glitched because of this game.. Sandbox 2d survival game.
8538	0	a	Got the four pack, and played it with my friends!!    10/10 would buy 4 more  After a while of playing, the Game was still Awesome, but my worlds would always glitch out and it would crash everytime i tried to join them, and i would lose my stuff, so I cant play SinglePlayer anymore. Please fix D:  SCREW THIS GAME, NOBODY WILL FIX ANYTHING WE SAY, BUT, MY GAME DELETED ALL MY WORLDS AND PLAYERS, PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEE FFFFFFFFFIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 0/99999999999999 DO NOT GET THIS PEICE OF CRAP OF A GAME
8539	0	a	There are people who this game will be enjoyed by. I was not one of them. In order to experience adventure, you have to grind an absurd amount and rely heavily on random luck. If you want to challenge yourself in combat, you're not going to have fun in a 2D slow-swinging sidescroller like this when there's so much better available. If you want creativity, you can do less in this game with the same amount of work as you can in Minecraft or other similar games.  But please, if you aren't satisfied with other similar games and think this might be the right balance for you, you should give it a try. I just wouldn't recommend it over the others, personally.
8540	0	a	Terraria is fun for a while. Then it becomes a part time job to manage your inventory.
8541	0	a	It's minecraft with less clear commands. The NPC that gives you advice doesn't really give useful advice.
8542	0	a	Gets boring after a while. A lot to do but is just to much work to grind and get good items.
8543	0	a	If your used to Xbox/Playstation controlls, then this game may not be for you. Unless of course you have a controller hooked up to the pc.
8544	0	a	Good game...However I would not tell you to get this for multiple reasons..One is once you beat the game there is nothing to do,two is that the devs that made the game will do anything to keep positive reviews...They even have paid people to rate the game good.So if I was you I would not get this game.
8545	0	a	Loved this game spent many an hour on it just buliding things with no plan in mind and doing challenges. Sadly the updates made it unplayable on my system as it killed my fps right down to 3 :(. Which I though was quite unfair, they basically upped the system load after release which is a stab in the groin at those with lower end systems that had already paid for the game. And for that I can not give it a thumbs up.
8546	0	a	Well that was a disappointment.
8547	0	a	This game is very boring and there is nothing to do, it's a waste of money and i recommend you don't buy it.
8548	0	a	it's alright. gets dry quick.

8551	0	a	to be honest its terrible. i hate that its in 2d and looks like a mario jump and run mixed with minecraft. nah.
8552	0	a	This is not worth more than a buck or two.
8553	0	a	I feel that this game is clunky and terrible, after having played it and compared it to Starbound. I got it for like 3 dollars + change and I feel like I paid too much.  
8554	0	a	Massive lack of information on how to play this game. No tutorial to start with which makes the whole process very frustrating. Game continuously throws enemies at you at a rate that does not allow you time to figure anything out. It doesn't pause when you go into crafting mode (which I haven't figured out as well) so by the time you begin to piece something together, you've died. Even if you kill all the enemies on the screen just to give yourself a breather, 8 more show up within about 5 seconds. So all in all, a terrible experience.  On the service, the 8-bit graphics convey a simple pick-up-and-play to figure things out, but so far this is not true. I will continue to give this game a shot as it has been very popular. But so far, it has been a purely frustrating experience. Or did I just buy Dark Souls, the 8-bit experience? I will update as I learn more.  TL;DR No introduction for new players coupled with a constant barrage of enemies makes it a very frustrating game to get into.
8555	0	a	Its awful
8556	0	a	Wish I could get my money back.
8557	0	a	Not really worth it if you liked minecraft.
8558	0	a	Can't buy 4 pack if you already have the game...
8559	0	a	dont get this game it bugs and deletes all your worlds and characters erasing all your porgress puting you into anger and depression when your pretty uch about to 100% it by beating every boss.
8560	0	a	If not playing with friends, then it gets broing quickly.
8561	0	a	If you are a hardcore Minecraft fan, this may be a game you enjoy. I found the tutorial too fast-paced and the game play frustratingly boring. I would recommend you skip this game and get Starbound if you want to try 2D minecraft-esque games.
8562	0	a	I like this game like i like Madlin Mcain, gathering dust im my libary

8568	0	a	2-d Minecraft clone
8569	0	a	Really bad game, feels literally like 2D minecraft but somehow even more boring. Really bad controlls combined with that does not make it that much of a fun game to play.

8571	0	a	
8572	0	a	Very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, the most least entertaining game ive played, and it was 10$.. What a joke loool
8573	0	a	Waste of $10, setting up server is annoying, gameplay is boring. Everything bad. Go play minecraft.
8574	0	a	Uninteresting, irritating, and difficult to adapt to, this game looked quite entertaining but proved to be rather disappointing. Combat was something best avoided, building early game shelters was like pulling teeth, and the items were difficult to read or distinguish from one another. Add to that unpredictable enemy movement, slidy and shaky player control, and the game's apparent stalwart desire to push you away, and it's a losing combination. On the whole, while the idea was excellent, the execution left much to be desired.
8575	0	a	This game....it just simply sucks
8576	0	a	i enjoyed this game better when it was downloading
8577	0	a	This is just a neverending freestyle game. Trust me, it is so boring to play alone in Single Player mode. I joined a few public servers in Multiplayer mode. All the public servers are disappointing. All the servers are administred by selfish â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s who would just simply ban you for cutting down a tree or building a small house. I simply has been banned for something that I didn't do in the last server I played. Unless Terraria hosts their own game servers, I don't really think Terraria gonna last long. And forever bye bye to TErraria.
8578	0	a	THIS IS REDICKULOS I SPEN 286 HOURS AND I GET A ERROR AND WHEN I LOOK FOR MY CHARCTER I CANT SELECT HIM AND HIS STUFF IS GONE DONT GET THIS WASIT OF MONEY
8579	0	a	could be monitor but game looks pixelated
8580	0	a	NO, NO, NO, NO, NOO! The 1.2 updates absolutely ruined the game by adding spiders! You're probably looking at my play time thinking: 'You've played almost 150 hours of it!' THAT WAS ALL BEFORE I DISCOVERED SPIDERS!
8581	0	a	It is really fun and is a bit like minecraft just alot of mods and 2d so much you can do on here. 0/10
8582	0	a	Its just the same every time. I know this is a really high rated video game and all and i don't think it sucks or anything but i don't think its great either. I just don't get why people find it so fun to go around in caves for hours. I just find it plain and boring and for me personally this game has never been fun to play for longer than 2 hours MAX ! I mean its cool and and all to play it with your friends but... thats all there really is to it. maybe its just the fact that i really don't like 2D games but its not a game for me sorry!  I'd give it 3,8/10 Stars ! For being.. well you already know.
8583	0	a	Minecraft clone.
8584	0	a	This game is fun for the most part but by best items keep disapearing. This has to be the WORST GLITCH EVER!
8585	0	a	A game to play with friends  Cant play with friends becuase the system is old and archaic garbage   1/10 can mine, cool .
8586	0	a	NO NO NO. Minecraft rip off with bad graphics. Not addictave at all. It is just boring and childish, Get somthing else, this is right by cod ghosts.
8587	0	a	Pre-update: Hilariously fun. Tons to do as well as having a more definitive and obvious goals. Very expansive and large world to play in, weapons to collect, monsters to defeat, even hell is a possible stomping ground! Definitly not for casual gamers, can be very unforgiviing if you dont know what your doing. definitly a 9/10 in my book!  Post update: I really don't care for this game anymore, It may have something to do with playing several hundred more hours of starbound and enjoying that more, or maybe it has something to do with terraria just being boring. I no longer reccomend this title.
8588	0	a	If you liked Terraria buy it on steam so it can crash 5 minutes into you logging on.
8589	0	a	So I was playing Hardcore difficulty, it turned night and I've been farming some resources for a quite a while, spent some time into the game. Then my guide opens the door to let a eye in and kill me. 12/10 would do again.
8590	0	a	Terraria has stopped working for me. It will not launch anymore. I tried everythimg I could. Uninstalling, installling, updating drives for my PC and nothing happens. Forget about tech support they never ansered me. I requested a refund and I was told it is too late. So, I paid for a game that I'\ can't play. When I try to launch Terraria  atI get the following error message:  System.ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a disposed object.Object name: 'WindowsGameForm'.at System.

8591	0	a	This Game Is Horrible.
8592	0	a	A lot of people was praising this (comparing to Minecraft) so I gave it a try. Killed some blobs and tried to dig a hole, didn't enjoy it. Want my money back.
8593	0	a	I alt-tabbed apparently out of this game for a long time. I did not actually enjoy the game that much pre 1.1 update but have not played since that to know if the newer large updates have made it more fun for me personally. I liked starbound for some reason but just couldn't get into this even though this is way more complete game than starbound is.   A game that most people will like but if you don't people will look at you funny.. especially if you tell them you liked starbound.
8594	0	a	Thought it was a bit dull and frustrating to be honest
8595	0	a	First of all, I want to make it clear that this is one of my favorite games of all time, and the quality is not the reason for a negative review. I have played 80 hours of this game as of when I wrote this, and I loved every minute of it. However, it's hard to enjoy something when all of that hard work dissapears; I was doing quite well in the game until I started to see small bugs with the world saves(map errors, npc housing resetting, nothing game breaking.) around 76 hours in. By that point I was already up to the level where I had an Adamantite pickaxe and Mythril armor, so I was absolutely loving it. Then, my worlds stopped saving. Not all of them, just 2 I hadn't played in a while. I wasn't too worried until my two main worlds became corrupt, crashing the game when they started up. I had been playing on my Mac laptop up until that point, so I tried using my desktop PC instead... Same thing happened. Now I have to start from scratch, and I feel just fine admitting that I feel insanely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off about losing a month's work in a single moment. So, my fellow gamers, don't build a castle just to get it torn down; just go build it somewhere else.
8596	0	a	It's great except when you lose a world and everything on it when the game decides to fail loading the backup world. Also you dont Ever move the files because it will f everything up and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you off even more

8618	0	a	ohhh boy, Terraria. I got word of this game from a friend after my Minecraft fever. They said it was basically like Minecraft except 2D, but had WAAYYYY more stuff. Well I wouldn't call this anything close to Minecraft, Terraria is so much better. I've played my share of this game and quit it from time to time, but it only takes a couple months before I'm back playing it again. The only thing I find REALLY gets in the way is the multiplayer. It's not linked with Steam so you have to go through a whole bunch of annoying processed to get multiplayer working which becomes effort than reward, simply because of this, i wouldn't suggest people this game unless you enjoy paying full price for half the game, because the best part of it, multiplayer, doesn't work.
8619	0	a	I really want to like this game but I just can't. The controls are hard to use and it's fun for the first hour or 2 but hen it gets boring really quickly. I bought it on sale and i think it's a bit pricey. I mean it seems like it could be a web browser game that you play for free. That's just what I think. Don't want to somehow offend anyone
8620	0	a	It's like Minecraft, but cheaper, and in 2D, wich sucks.
8621	0	a	Minecraft clone. 10/10 dont recommend.

8624	0	a	this game is so dumb for one reason gettin your friends to join is so flippin hard u really need to make online servers would make this game 1000 times more appealing ill change my review or make a new one if u ever decide to work on this i tired port forwarding and all that other crap just cant get it silly shi
8625	0	a	This game is great. It has a lot of stuff to offer, and tons of things to do. But, if you have played Starbound, Terraria kind of seems burnt out. I have only played five hours and i dont really like it that much.
8626	0	a	Local Servers Are So Hard To Play With Freinds. 
8627	0	a	Hulk hate
8628	0	a	Final Rating: 5/10 Closing Statements: This game was fun for the first couple of hours, but I gradually got bored of it and never really picked it back up again. If you're bored or you're a diehard minecraft fan then you ahead and pick it up. Yet, I really don't recommend this game because there are many other games out there that are more worthy or your attention.   A lot of people say that this game is the 2-D Minecraft and I think that's a fair analysis of the game. You gather resources during the day and get attacked by various 'creatures' at night. There's obviously no true storyline that comes across in this game.   'You survive, get better resources, build better equipment, and defeat more and more powerful monsters.' There is also a way to play online with your friends via building a client-side server.   Pros: Fairly balanced level of difficulty Semi-Open World Many different Items you can craft  Magic! Online play with your friends Build a house for NPC's and they'll be your best friend  Cons: The use of a wiki might be required I was never that much of the game mechanics. The process of creating items seemed more difficult than it had to be.  No 'developed' storyline Dig Down and Down, and Down, and Down :/  Note: I know there are a lot of people that love this game, but I quite simply couldn't get into it. I found the game very boring and 'rage quitingly' difficult at times.  Compared to this game, Minecraft takes the cake.  Save your money
8629	0	a	Its Terraible.
8630	0	a	I Really don't recommend this game because its very boring and it lagged me out. I thought it was going to be awesome as my friends told me but it wasn't what i expected.
8631	0	a	Gameplay - 3.  Game it is like - Minecraft but 2D instead of 3.  What is this? - The game creates random worlds for you to play. Like minecraft you are looking for materials to make better weapons and armor, except your tools and armor don't break. You also don't need to worry about food. The game features about 10 bosses, 5 different events that randomly can occur and has days and nights are 24 minutes long. Monsters spawn really rapidly and are easy to defeat. You can create a town of NPC shops that prevent spawning. Pros - Bosses can be difficult Cons - It takes a long time to build up your towns, find bosses, get materials to spawn bosses, search online for hours to recipes and how to find bosses.  I played it a lot because a nephew of mine was banned from Minecraft and wanted a game we could play together. It was fun to see the look in his eyes when I'd undercover new items and new bosses.  
8632	0	a	this review is red
8633	0	a	This game is horrible. Endless repetitive fights that don't take any skill, just attention; endless repetitive digging looking for just a little loot; work work work, dig dig dig, fight fight fight, and aimless wandering. This is too much like real life but without the variety that makes life interesting. This is a hopeless boring game.
8634	0	a	This game has its moments. These moments shine in multiplayer though. The game is only fun with friends who are willing to stick together, help each other and overall be there maybe not all the time but most of the time. Unless you have enough people to play with who will help you out, not fun at all.
8635	0	a	dis game is a poop
8636	0	a	(compared to minecraft):  positive: +far more monsters +more weapons  neutral: ~plays like a jump and run with weapons ~2D world  negative: -no way to build electric/logic circuits(like redstone) -town concept is boring and predictable/manipulable -the concept makes it far less versatile f.e.no custom-games (especially competive) like spleef arena
8637	0	a	i added tapi and i unistall it and it will not let me play terraria 
8638	0	a	no because right when i bought the game as soon as all of the downloads were done i click play and i did not work so who ever wants to get this game do not or you lose $9.99 cents ok.
8639	0	a	This game is crap and I would like to return it
8640	0	a	ive gotten this game installed on my computer, it was a friends game and he let me install it and gave me access to it and everything. It just wont let me play. When i try to open the game it brings me to the games home page instead of actually opening it. I really dont mean to complain but im really just disappointed. :(

8643	0	a	This is a fun game but, it gets boring after sometime. But I would put my money in something else like minecraft, starbound, or any other game.
8644	0	a	During the day you are fighting slime and at night you are fighting zombies. Very repetivtive and got old fast.
8645	0	a	Despite the main picture, the main enemy is not a tree
8646	0	a	The 2d exp for this game was rather unpleasant. I couldn't adjutst properly to the visuals and found the controls to be awkward (Noob to the game, cant cut down a tree unless I google it). Just my opinion.
8647	0	a	It's boring.
8648	0	a	Game sucked couldt even play with friends
8649	0	a	I did not play this, i hate it! All the hours on it was from my friend!
8650	0	a	this game is a complete wast of ur time, if u thought this was minecraft, well then ur wrong. i spent most of my weekend trying to host and join my friends server and searched up multiple turtouriels. we couldnt do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.if ur some guy who only got this game to play with friends, well sorry players. THIS MULTYPLAYER IS CRAP!. Which is why i bought this game on my playstation :)
8651	0	a	i cant play every time i go to steam it say i cant connect to the servers and wont launch anything!!!
8652	0	a	i would have recommended about 1 or more when it was free , but now it is 10 dollars , so i don't really recommended 
8653	0	a	this game keeps crashing every time i press a button other than that i would recomend it
8654	0	a	want to play  as FFV butz ripoff  swinging your axe like a yoyo and read a font worst  than comic sans ? this game is for you!
8655	0	a	The terraria 1.3 up made this game useless for me. I got a Brand new Dell Inspiron M731R laptop for the chirstmas of 2014(1TB internal, 2TB external), prior to the 1.3 update my laptop run it beautifully. After 1.3 update: I keep getting errors about graphics cards, ram, etc. Well i have all my non factory installed programs on a 2TB hard drive except for the required steam and terraria software. My computer will run any other steam or non steam program fine. So in conclusion 1.3 i couldnt even test it out because the update rendered terraria unplayable on my less-than-year-old laptop....oh well time to play F.S.15 or wait for windows 10 and try it again, otherwise i had loved this game. Update: yes i have checked online and on my laptop myself and it meets and exceeds all requirments... Windows 8.1(set to update to windows 10 when it comes out) 8 GB ram video card and graphics meet and exceeds, alog with everything else
8656	0	a	I just can't like this game. I really just can't. I have tried playing this alone and getting into it, ive tried playing with friends and getting into it. I just don't find any aspect of it interesting or fun. Then with the way my friends push me to play this game like its the best thing in the world, I just can't like it.
8657	0	a	I TAKE EVERYTHING BACK THIS SUCKS THE NW UPDATE RESET EVERYTHING I HAD. true excaliber, chlorophyte armour, guns, repeater, full health, full mana e.t.c.  I LOST SOME OF THE HARDEST STUFF IN THE GAME TO GET I MEAN SERIOUSLY I HAD THE TURTLE ARMOUR ON DISPLAY WHICH I GOT LEGIT
8658	0	a	Sorry,but really dissapointed about this game..i guess im not really to 2D games
8659	0	a	I never got into this game. I really don't know why because everyone seems to love this game. I played it when it first came out but it never blew me away. The only potential I ever saw in this game was when I played it on my smartphone. It seemed like a perfect mobile game if it only had controller support.  When I heard that there was a new patch, I wanted to try it out again. I noticed that I didn't have any old save files so I thought it was a good opportunity to start fresh. I decided to play online with my friends, since there was apparently a new feature that allowed you to connect through Steam. (Last time I wanted to play I couldn't even get the online mode working so I quickly lost interest) Ok, some minor connection problems at first but then I got connected and started playing. When I went on exploring the world the enemies started teleporting around me and killing me instantly. I was kinda bummed by this and tried googling for a fix thinking that there should be an easy fix for this since the game has been around for quite some time. I tried a bunch of things but nothing seemed to work so I thought I'll just let it go and try single player mode.  Ok, at least the single player mode works and I can finally play the game. I begin exploring the world and digging deeper and I'm kinda starting to understand why people enjoy this so much. I realize that I'm actually making progress and enjoying the game. I stay up late playing and somewhat reluctantly call it quits and go to bed. I'm anxiously waiting to fall asleep so I can wake up and continue playing.  I wake up, brush my teeth and start up Terraria. I load my character and notice that something is missing. I can't find my world save. Maybe I'm just tired, because it should be here. No, it's really not there. It has been replaced by a nameless world with an unknown world size. I try loading the world but it just crashes the game. This time I really hope there is a fix. Interestingly I find forum posts from four years ago that report the same problem, and a possible fix is to disable the autosave function. Well, it's too late for that now. I try the obvious thing and restore to a previous file version. The previous version is from two days ago when I started playing which would mean that I'll lose all my progress and the world is back to where it started.  This is unacceptable. Please fix the bugs or remove all the functions that will break the game or somehow make it worse. Or at least warn people that something like this might happen. You've had plenty of time to fix all these things. I really wanted to like this game, but I quit. I just quit. I'm done trying to fix a game that should not be this badly broken. I wish I could just refund this so I never have to try it again and be disappointed.
8660	0	a	And as of 1.3, the issues with Terraria have gotten worse once more. Mostly in the form of the most absurd last boss fight in history, so severely railroaded that it might as well come with the disclaimer 'you need the exact expected equipment setup and battle strategy to survive this fight'. Doesn't help that it's also preceded by no less than FIVE other bosses fought in a row. The insulting Expert Mode was also added, designed to pander to the sub-1% of Terraria players who thought the game was somehow 'too easy' before. I can only recommend Terraria as it stands if you happen to hate fun, as the developers clearly do.
8661	0	a	my terraria will not work something about a missing verifacation or something
8662	0	a	its not fun its very hard very boring and you will die alot i even tryed to refund this game but they denied to do it
8663	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8664	0	a	PLEASE READ BEFORE THUMBS DOWN: so i bought it. its really dumb. why do you have to craft walls to put in the backround? why cant it be like its better younger brother starbound? look, i know that this will get a bunch of backlash, thumbs downs, and general 10 year old hate. its just doesn't appeal to me. you should seriously research the game before you buy, such as watch lets plays, try it at a friends, and most importantly, get a feel for the game. study the mechanics, controls, and the general feeling you have when you play. for me, a huge survival, fps, and beat em' up rpg fan, the feelings i get are dissapointment, boredom, and confusion. the controls feel clunky, you have to jump out of water, cant swim out, yet there is a breath meter. you have a hotbar that you keep cycling through to different items, and just... the game gives you that 'ugh. really?' feeling. i dont mean to offend any fans of the game, but i dont like this game. i obviously didnt sink a ton of time into the game, but im sure some people find it more enjoyable after they make a bunch of progress.
8665	0	a	I'm glad steam refunds policy really changed so I can get a refund on this crap.  It probly isn't crap but I haven't at all enjoyed it. :|
8666	0	a	To easy wasted 9 hours of my life. Found Faker and beat him in a 1v1 without the Jacob Xiong blade.
8667	0	a	IT DOESNT LAUNCH!!!!
8668	0	a	i wish i didnt spend money on this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8669	0	a	So much fun!!!I highly recomend this game,its replayable,many vanity combat style and equipment combos,creativity in your buildings,2D platformer with dungeons that conatains amazing stuff which can be used to make even better stuff,npcs that are unlocked when you are meeting reqiurements they also need housing,many events like goblin army (which will annoy a lot as you get future in the game) also these events requires some amount of hp and gear and you can get some rare drops as well, easy mode and hardmode by killing hell boss (wall of flesh) many accesories acludding rocket boots nad wings,bosses which you need to kill to get for example driad or killing skeletron to get acces to the dungeon.Many bioms,amazing underground,not so easy when the game gets serious (hard mode) tons of gear and weapons.magical,ranged,mellee and newly summoning. If i have to write all to stuff os good about this game i would finish about hour later lets end it with price only 10E and goes on slae 2E,am saying buy it its more than worth it!Well after it crashed i got my main character and world dleted and backups or anything cant load the character back,even after it worked it did the same thing again,the game itself is fun but the technical page kinda sucks for me.(negative)
8670	0	a	It's just a meaty version of Minecraft. You gather for hours, you build for hours, you kill for hours, you get bored of it just as fast.
8671	0	a	i need help. the game wont start up it keeps on saying it has stoped working. and i have deleted it and then re downloaded it but it still wont work
8672	0	a	Just really boring
8673	0	a	Multiplayer wouldn't work. Thats the only reason I got the game and it didn't even work. If you want to play multiplayer you might as well leave the computer. It just doesn't work and it's a piece of crap.
8674	0	a	What I would think would be an amazing game with all of it's positive feedback from the community really let me down. It's like Minecraft but much less fun. Not as much about ceativity but more about exploration.
8675	0	a	Not my cup of tea. And to the viral fans of this game who stand up for it like it's their God, I really don't care about your opinion. I didn't like it, accept it. It's good to a pretty big sized group of people, but it's not guaranteed. Nothing is. For me, this game was very boring.
8676	0	a	really boring and i have no idea whats going on
8677	0	a	I just couldn't get into this game. It's super popular with my friends and tons of people but I got quickly bored after a day or two in game. I kept trying to no avail. It would probably be more fun in multiplayer with my friends, but they all moved on to different games by now. I can't handle strangers on the internet.  I like the music and backgrounds, and the randomly generated maps can be fun. Getting a house built before nightfall was really fun and driving force for the game. But I just didn't have a reason to keep at it after that other that upgrading my house. The worlds were somewhat repetitive and it being a 2D side scroller really damaged the exploration value. There's only so many pallatte swaps on the same map icons I can interpret as new area.  I'll stick with minecraft's creative mode. Terraria is just not for me. If you like platformers, 2D side scrollers, and getting attacked by endless slimes while cutting down trees, I'd give it a shot. If you like survival games wherein overnight the rapebeasts come out, I'd also give this a shot. But it's just not my cup of tea.
8678	0	a	Terraria was fun until my data corrupted.
8679	0	a	So, normally I would highly recommend this game. It is fun and full of content.  However, with this new update a bug has been completely destroying me and many others game. Terraria wont even launch, and nothing fixes it. It is currently a waste of space in my steam library, which I can't do anything about. When this problem is fixed, perhaps I'd recommend it once more.
8680	0	a	I've been a long time lover of Terraria, and stopped playing a year ago to focus on college and my career. I come back all excited with a new update! After dying countless times and being spawn killed REPEATEDLY (playing on the regular difficulty mind you), I get my hallowed armor and excalibur, and teleport home for a solar eclipse! Finally a chance for broken hero swords, right? WRONG. When I last played, they were a drop from frankensteins and swamp things, and an abysmal drop rate at that. As soon as I get home, I'm taken apart in SECONDS by the new monster that the Terraria dev team wants to bone you over with... Mothron. As if the game wasn't frustrating enough as it was already, apparently it's cool to have every other day be a spawn-kill-fest, and the guest of honor is you! I don't get it, why was it considered a good idea to amp up the difficulty so much? The fun game known as Terraria is now nothing more than a rage game for me. I can't enjoy this game anymore. Am I supposed to be playing ONLY with other players, and single player is condemned with all this needless difficulty? I'm confused and irate as all manner of hell. I cannot recommend this game to ANYONE on the account of how frustratingly difficult it is, as if the abysmal drop rates for the only items that can help you defeat the hordes of overpowered enemies that spawn-kill you to oblivion weren't bad enough. Thanks, Terraria developers, for turning one of my favorite games into a Dark Souls-Minecraft abomination.
8681	0	a	Couldnt really get into it, hard to understand. 5/10
8682	0	a	i dont recomend it but if you play multi you have a whole diffrent story coming your way and that includes ADVENTURE
8683	0	a	No controller support, none of the common mods work with the latest version, keeps crashing/freezing and can't be played fullscreen. No idea what actually playing the game is like after you wade through all this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.
8684	0	a	Formerly reviewed Terraria as a recommendation, now I just can't recommend it anymore.  - Fails to Steam Sync, causing the game to crash constantly. (Majority loading characters and worlds) - Crashes on it's own. (Loading characters and worlds) - Has a chance to randomly unannouncibly close while playing, causing you to lose all progress since your last save. - When crashing, also crashes the entirety of your Steam program.  All in all, while a really fun game, its nearly unplayable. 9/10 without the crashing. 3/10 with the crashing.  Fix your crap Re-Logic.
8685	0	a	Unfortunately, this game was too boring for me. Minecraft with mods add infinitely value, while terraria with mods seems paltry.
8686	0	a	I never really enjoyed this. I'm sorry to everyone who does, but I don't see what's enjoyable about it.
8687	0	a	This games great but I want to take this opportunity to blackmail the devs into adding local multiplayer. Not adding it is a serious oversight.
8688	0	a	Unfortunately this game is better on a console. No split-screen and controller support really ruins the game.
8689	0	a	Keeps crashing, Lenny face no like. :-( pls fix
8690	0	a	Bought it during sales looking at the positive ratings. It's not for adults if you ask me.
8691	0	a	i regret paying money for this. its a 2d minecraft. 
8692	0	a	I love this game and all but, every few days all my worlds, characters and custom settings get deleted. its a real shame since I cant complete the game. Nobody else I've talked to has this problem so PLZ FIX.
8693	0	a	Are you really in the negative reviews for TERRARIA!!! This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life, so scroll up out of negative reviews and click that purchase button!!!  P.S. I really recommend this game

8698	0	a	Can't get past the first obstacle in either direction. Two choices, both impossible. Infinite slimes and zombies, AFK is not a possibility.  We built upwards to avoid zombies. Shortly after, demon eyeball PK'd us.  10/10 would accomplish absolutely nothing never again
8699	0	a	why are you even here? there is no such thing as negative review for terraria. please get back to the other side.
8700	0	a	Terrible game. I played for an hour and still didn't realize how to build walls in a front layer. Lack of tutorials.
8701	0	a	Opened game, made a character, spawned a map, waddled around for 10 minutes figuring out all the controls, got literally no directions, tutorials, objectives, or hints as to what was going on or why. Just piles of menus, and nonsensical controls.  Not sure why so many developers now seem to think that directions and tutorials are passe.

8715	0	a	It doesn't work, I try to load it and it works fine, but when I try to actually play, it freezes on the loading screen of the match, I've looked up and changed its properties, the only thing that changed was it had a new loading message and a higher loading percentage. Windows 10

8720	0	a	uh, it turned night, and I just watched a black starfield for 30 minutes, dying 15 times by black monsters on a black sky. is there actually a game here, or just a starfield simulator?
8721	0	a	This WAS a fun game, i played it alot some time ago, and i still do on console. But when i tried it now on PC... The developers have updated the resolution in such a way that for me, the game is broken. I just cant play it, either it stretches and blurs, or everything gets way to small, i`ve tried all resolutions with a 1920x1080 screen and nothing works, it`s just become so unpleasant to play i`ll probably never gonna bother with it on PC again...  But it`s okay on console, so i recommend you go there
8722	0	a	noob grqafics. frend troled me got raded defrendd frend bad guy sux 0/10 noob game
8723	0	a	Do NOT get it sits in your downloads and says 80.0mb left and the time when it is done downloading.  'IT IS JUST A WAST OF YOUR MONEY DO NOT GET'
8724	0	a	I have a few problems with this game.  First in almost every game I played with my friend if I expolored left or right there was some area with over powered mobs, which made it feel like i could not explore much outside of the forrest area that we spawned in. Also there were not many caves that connected to the surface so once my friend explored them all I felt like that there was not much that I could do. Another problem I had was the bosses. When I did a boss battle the difficulty seemed to come from the boss spamming you and the 'strategy' to it was just kiting. And the bosses were hard to spawn so when some boss kills you just by spamming a bunch of things, you have to respawn it. Lastly when I looked in the negative review section, all of them were the same stupid 'joke' where people just said 'Why r u looking in the negative review section, just buy the game already!', which is just stupid because it makes the overall percentage of people who liked lower.
8725	0	a	this is suck after while, not buy!

8745	0	a	im really confused.. i have a mid 07 imac 2.4ghz with 6gb of ram . spec wise i should be able to run this no problem. however.. i try and play it and i get a pop up that says i can not play this on my platform. like wth ..
8746	0	a	This game is a lot of fun. However the best way to play is with friends and the muliplayer simply doesnt work. The game will not let you join a friends world and when invited you will be kicked within a minute of joining. Dont waste your money on a game that says it has multiplayer but wont allow you to play multiplayer.

8748	0	a	Fun, but glitchy. Lost my best world because of some idiotic glitch
8749	0	a	I have a fear of slimes, and at one point in the game it started to rain slime, I was so scared I immediately closed the game. Why must there be slimes in games ;(
8750	0	a	PLOT TWIST: I love this game
8751	0	a	Terraria killed my mom. It made her go dead. One day i came in on her playing with her Terraria husband. She loved him more than she loved me. I would ask her for food and water, she told me to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and die. I told her to get food for the dog but she told to kill my dog. I rate it a 10/10 game would never play again. Don t play this game or it will kill you like it killed my mom.
8752	0	a	sooo.... what happened to the 'monthly updates' the devs promised?
8753	0	a	First things first, I love this game. however, it seems to start having issues once you start getting a lot of hours. The longer you play on a world the laggier it gets and the more frequently it crashes. It finally got to the point where the world became unplayable and then the save got corrupted loosing me 150+ hours of play. I very much hope that this will be fixed, but until then, I'm going to hae to give it a negative review.
8754	0	a	Theres too much to understand and learn about and i find myself researching things about the game then actually playing it. Maybe it's just not my type of game.  Now go buy something else...     Han dies   
8755	0	a	Have ot been able to load this program!
8756	0	a	Can someone help me? Its not letting me run my game?!?!
8757	0	a	I really can't get into this game. I don't know why, but it just feels repetative. Even when you get gear, fight bosses, get better gear, you start asking yourself, 'for what?' After you've reached end-game, there is no replay value. You've already done everything the game has to offer. I will admit, there was some fun in playing with friends, but even we would get bored after about a half hour to an hour of gameplay, because it was just doing the same routine over and over again. Nothing exciting happens outside of the worms and falling into pits of mobs.
8758	0	a	Nope
8759	0	a	LOST MY CHARACTER AND WORLD ENTIRELY!!!!!!!!!!!! [JUST TO BE WARNED, THIS MIGHT HAPPEN TO EVRYONE]
8760	0	a	0/10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game that needs to get gud
8761	0	a	After the latest update I get ridiculous framerate drops whenever I use weapons. I have tried restarting the game, playing on the lowest graphical settings, etc. I cannot find a solution anywhere. The unstable framerate has made the game unplayable.
8762	0	a	It's an awesome game, no doubt about that. But they need to, and I mean need to fix how easily it is for worlds to corrupt. This is not just me I have been digging and looking and it is all over worlds getting corrupt left and right. So, please please please! Fix the problem with the worlds becoming corrupt.
8763	0	a	Originally, I really liked this game. Building my own little village is awesome; filling it with people and creating my own little 'community'. Exploring the caves and building my own mine system is great. Combat is pretty simplistic- and sometimes annoying, but alright. Sure, the graphical style wasn't my favorite, but I could understand why people like it. Everything was pretty awesome, that was until I reached the next evolutionary stage of the game- the spread of corruption.  As soon as you defeat the Wall of Flesh, the game kicks off and starts increasing the spread of corruption- changing the world above, and in my opinion- creating an unecessary stress on the game. I had the same problem with Majora's mask; the constant reminder that you have only so much time before you lose all of your items or have to reset. It's basically a chore in an otherwise amazing game. Dealing with the ever expanding corruption is the same kind of chore; a constant reminder that the world is being destroyed, and you have to check on it every once in a while to ensure it hasn't wet the bed. Which is what breaks Terraria for me.  An argument against this would be 'Just don't go into the next stage'. The thing is, so much extra content is in the next stage. New bosses, new 'villagers', new blocks, new weapons, new everything. It's like becoming a 'member' of a free to play game- like Runescape or World Of Warcraft. Of course, you must pay for membership in these games- with money that someone has to earn. In Terraria, you 'pay for the membership' with dealing with corruption. The thing is- it isn't worth paying for the membership, at least for me.   Which is why I like Starbound better. Progression isn't stressful, combat and exploration always feels fresh and new, and there isn't any constant reminders or chores that you have to deal with that would otherwise detract from the experience. I haven't played Starbound in a while, but as soon as I got it, I understood why I didn't like Terraria.   If you are okay with having chores in an otherwise amazing game, go right ahead. It's not for me though.
8764	0	a	i dont know why but when terraria updated my player was gone my world was gone and my brother's world was gone too! now he hates me and he has had 3 worlds and they were all amazing and they wereall deleted he was just about to fight the destroyer and tghen his world was gone! please help me because this game is awesome! and i dont wanna delete it  because of amazing worlds deleting and the back-up files dont have the worlds and my character! im sorry but i dont  recommend this game anymore unless this gets fixed......
8765	0	a	Uninstalled. Nerfraria is bestraria.
8766	0	a	This is a game with a concept of minecraft (one of the worlds most know games besides mario) its cheaper and fun but. It has a crappy system of hosting servers, there is no clear way to have a working server for friends or fellow gamers to play on. You might say this is a great game but i haven't had a great impression. To me this is a game for people who don't know about minecraft or if you don't have enough money to pay for minecraft but in other words i like minecraft better and this game isn't for me.
8767	0	a	PIECE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GARBAGE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS WASTE OF MONEY. (It was free for me, and I still feel cheated). KEEP YOUR KIDS AWAY FROM THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T.
8768	0	a	I wish I'd read some negative reviews before buying this game. I appreciate the potential, but I'm not a fan of co-op or multi-player games. Don't get me wrong - I'm a people person. But when I sit at my computer to play a game, it's to enjoy some me-time. I found this game incredibly tedious as a single-player endeavor, and other reviewers seem to feel the same way.  So here's the thing - I do not recommend this game, but I think folks in the mood for some collaborative play would probably enjoy it.
8769	0	a	Were you done playing minecraft, well youre done playing terraria. not even worth the 2 euros. just go watch a lets play or something
8770	0	a	Simple 2D game that i got borde of very fast
8771	0	a	If you are looking for a enjoyable game in which to explore, build, be creative, and simply just have fun, look elsewhere. Terraria promises none of these aspects.
8772	0	a	Go buy Starbound.
8773	0	a	If you like long crawls with little-to-no progress and the most obnoxious mob spawning ever concieved, play this game. Make a town. Get unlucky enough to have goblins attack.  Without fault, you'll ditest this game and yourself a little more every time you pick up your sword and fail to scroll over to it in time to stop the marauders from turning you into gelatin in the shape of what may have once been human. And what is up with the female damage sounds? Why do they sound like a sensual moan when you're getting attacked by vultures or breaking your legs from a fall? The art-style is decent at least.
8774	0	a	I like Minecraft. I thought: 2D minecraft and its on sale! Don't really enjoy it.
8775	0	a	the game keeps crashing i quit!
8776	0	a	Sh**iest game ever . it cant let get back the crafting menu
8777	0	a	This game is a steaming pile of crap i defeat skeletron prime the twins and the destroyer and my world gets deleted for no reason no recommendation
8778	0	a	its ok can really get boring
8779	0	a	I bought this hoping to play on my TV with controller, but was dissapointed when i found out it doesn't support controllers (Unless i'm missing something here). Why this doesn't support controllers but the console versions do i don't know &gt;.&lt; Oh well
8780	0	a	There's doubtless hours and hours of content to explore here, but if you're not a fan of platforming, side-scrolling combat or endless grinding for better gear you're not going to have a good time with this game. Unfortunately I couldn't get to any of the 'end game' content due to the frustration of the clumsy movement and combat mechanics, and after 9 hours I felt like I experienced nothing of any value. Some people love spending hundreds of hours grinding out some cool stuff, I don't.
8781	0	a	(This is all based on a personal opinion if my playthough) This game is terrible Here are some of the reasons why 1- How the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do I play this?: Hand holding sucks, but atleast a tutorial explaining a game basics is appreciated. Terraria doesnÂ´t tell you ANYTHING on how to play it. That means searching on Google how to do basic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like 'how to build a house' or 'how to place a door'. And the so called 'tutorial NPC' is useless  2- No multiple save files for one character: I have no idea why the developers havenÂ´t implemented this. When you create a character you can choose what will happen if he/she dies.  Softcore- You lose money Mediumcore- You lose items Hardcore- Permadeath I went with mediumcore. I was having a ton of fun until I discovered a dungeon. I decided to explore it. I heard some the boss music, but I didnÂ´t saw him, so I guessed he was below me. I was about go down to fight the boss when suddenly, he appears and 1 hit kills me. And my items are in the same place in which I died, so when I tried to go get them, I got killed by something I coulndÂ´t fight. There was no way to rescue my items, so all the time I wasted getting those items went to hell. And this could have been prevented if there was a way to save before entering the dungeon.  3- No way to skip the night section Pretty much self explanatory. If IÂ´m not doing anything I should be given the option to skip to the next day.  4- No explanation on the controls I was moving some items to a chest, but it was taking a while so I decided to press Shift while cliking on the items. SURPRISE SURPRISE. That deletes the items... HOW THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?  5- The multiplayer is based on IP adresses and not servers, meaning that, in order to find a server, you must search the IP adress and then connect to it.  4/10
8782	0	a	Very bad game, dont buy this!
8783	0	a	I do like this game. Its just not worth a â‚¬10 in my opionion.
8784	0	a	I love the game its suppper fun and in my opinion its better than MC, BUT i am very mad!!!!! 2 times already my world has been deleted for no aparent reason and it jsut makes you not want to play it! Try it if ur intrested but im tired of playing it with this bug
8785	0	a	I had no idea what I was doing when I started this game....and I learned nothing. If I can't get into a game in the first 10 minutes, I don't see why I should keep playing. Maybe I'll try again another time.
8786	0	a	Waste of 10 dollars
8787	0	a	You know what I hate this game now, everytime me and my friends try and launch a sever it either lags out or just gets stuck on the found server pages. So the last thing this peice of s*** was good for is now void. Play Starbound instead of this obsolete game.
8788	0	a	Dont buy, simple as that. Kill slimes etc and dig thats it... :(
8789	0	a	Sucks massive ball â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8790	0	a	for a game that focuses on adventure, weapons, and killing things. the combat system is boring and simple
8791	0	a	the game keeps deleting stuff from my inventory and when i put stuff in a chest it deletes every thing
8792	0	a	meh. that's all, really; 'meh.'
8793	0	a	Worst game ever i cry the money i scammed to buy this
8794	0	a	I bought Terraria because a friend recommended it. I've had a hard time maintaining interest in the game. This may be because I compare it to Minecraft, and Terraria just seems like a 2D version of Minecraft.
8795	0	a	TERRIBLE! DO NOT GET. Crashes every time you make a decent world, cant mine above your head just terrible.
8796	0	a	This game is not a game that anyone with work, school or anything that you want to get done in life should play. This game is addicting even though it looks boring and is slightly is.
8797	0	a	All items went missing on death, disappeared from game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this shÃ­t. /rage
8798	0	a	I'll tell ya the truth here: This game is hard. Especially if you're too used to Minecraft to get used to it. Popular as it is, I wouldn't recommend it to those who think it's just a side-scroller clone of Minecraft.   (Get the game if any of the things I wrote didn't give you any hints. Find out whether it's worth the money or not.)
8799	0	a	awful multiplayer support. that is all.
8800	0	a	Blue thats all
8801	0	a	This game is garbage, don't waste your money. If you want to play Minecraft, play Minecraft.
8802	0	a	can't play on mac so when my friends got it we couldnt play i was disapointed  
8803	0	a	this game sucks
8804	0	a	it wont even let me play the game
8805	0	a	horrable game its boring when your not playing with friends then it makes you go around like a crazy person just to get a server port and its dumb cause i cant even get it up and me and my friend know how to do it     my last comment WASTE OF MONEY
8806	0	a	play thru once in a day and never again
8807	0	a	This is the least fun I've ever had playing a game. I recommend Starbound over this; Starbound is a beta and is still significantly better than this game. This markets itself as a 2-D Minecraft, without the fun of Minecraft.
8808	0	a	This game is sort of designed to be an addictive time sink and it's kind of transparent. Most of the game is spent waiting for your little man to dig so that it's satisfying when you've finally dug enough. If you're worried about spending your time effectively, it's not going to feel good to play this game.   That's not to say there are no fun parts. Exploring existing caves, getting lost down in the deep dark underground, and getting upgrades ARE fun. It's just that they're part of a game that's drawn out too long and I don't recommend it unless you're looking to kill as much time as possible on a game.
8809	0	a	This game it me is good but i just don't like how it reminds me of minecraft but 2d and starbound (the second game) is the same but with spaceships (this is just what i think)
8810	0	a	When I group this game with others that share the concept I am left thinking, 'I still like MineCraft'. Though it is a complex and fun game it isn't really on the same par. If Minecraft isn't your cup of tea, then this may fill the world creation void in your gaming.
8811	0	a	This game wouldn't be so bad if they gave you intstruction on how to perform basic tasks, like crafting, but sadly it doesn't. It makes the game extremely frustrating and unfun. Furthermore, the system for multiplayer is flawed to such the extent that it requires the use of Hamachi to utilize. If the game has a multiplayer option it should be multiplayer without the use of third party software.
8812	0	a	It sucks,terrible game it wouldnt let me do much of anything like jumping half the time,and placing stuff?good luck, i didnt even get an hour in before getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and quitting
8813	0	a	I don't recomand this game...I played for 30 minutes ,and it's boring(as a FPS gamer) , If you don't like minecraft I suggest NOT TO BUY THIS GAME!!! For me it's just : Mario combined with Minecraft and Zelda , nothing special ,IMHO. I regret...I spent my money on this...
8814	0	a	I despise this inelegant, obtuse, pointless game.
8815	0	a	saw everyone playing the game and thought id get it on offer, played for 30 minuttes and couldnt figure out how to get my house made without anything gonig through the walls. spent an hour online searching and finally found out i ahd to build the back wall but no information no how to make it.  so i cannot with any sense reccomend a game that doenst even give a basic tutorial in game. deffinetly a 0/10 for everything.
8816	0	a	It was ssssooooo pathetic and boring....Watching paint dry has more entertainment than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t game...
8817	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME.  This game is really bad made i know it's like minecraft but minecraft is better because mods and stuff but this game is like a piece of crap sorry to say waste of money!.
8818	0	a	Very boring and pointless, even when you play with friends. If you're not into sandbox games, do not buy this. I bought this game because I have never played a sandbox game before and I wanted to try it out.  Basically, if you don't like sandbox games, don't buy this, very big waste of $10, I would return if it was possible. Yes my gameplay time is over 10 hours but most of the time I just left the game on while afk. I played for like 3 hours and don't plan on playing again, big waste of $10
8819	0	a	i dont reccomend this game unless u like this sort of thing i just hated it my opinion i do not reccomend this
8820	0	a	I am losing my data every time I update my steam, dont buy this game.
8821	0	a	This is an alright game, but I'm just going to leave it as simple as it's disappointing. I give it a 3/10
8822	0	a	Someone else already said it better than I can: This is one of those games thats really bad and good at the same time, it reminds me a lot more of 2D Skyrim than it does minecraft
8823	0	a	so fucvking boring
8824	0	a	there is a bug with my game my friend gifted it to me and when i downloaded it it it would not load and it itis getting really annoying
8825	0	a	Momentarily quirky and promising, but very quickly pointless.  2 out of 5.
8826	0	a	It's an interesting little game but I just couldn't get pulled into it like other sandbox games have done for me. Perhaps there isn't enough visual feedback, I don't know. Clearly there's a huge player base for this but not for me. I would recommend to try it out first (or watch some videos) before buying unless you already know exactly what your getting.
8827	0	a	This game is a rip off of Minecraft, and I don't like it.
8828	0	a	Its a terrible version of minecraft. Its not fun at all and the controls are pretty annoying. By that I mean i hate using the mouse to do everything pretty much.
8829	0	a	The game is awful. It's boring, and the gameplay is very slow. If you want to buy this, buy it when there is a discount on the game 
8830	0	a	 www.google.com/THISGAMEISBAD    look it up
8831	0	a	I dont recommend this game. I say that because evertime i get into hardmode and get a pair of wings and some good items, everytime i go off for a bit my caracter gets deleted. Plz fix and maybe ill reccomned it
8832	0	a	This game is basicly a 2-D Minecraft. This games mechanics and bad, and the load up is worse than Minecraft, and Minecraft is a 3-D game. In the end, don't spend $10:00 on this game, unless you really want to try it.
8833	0	a	Terraria is a good game but if your about to buy it and have $15 stop right now and go look at Starbound just stop right now and go check it out if you don't like it and like this more fine but man are you missing out!
8834	0	a	Terraria best fits on consoles more than on steam. Servers are very hard and complicated to get into, and solo is just incredibly boring. The game is pretty cool for a sale but not for 10 dollars
8835	0	a	If you like a crappy boot leg minecraft, this is the game for you. Im not sure if this came out before minecraft but its just so so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8836	0	a	EVER LOOK AT A FLOWER AND HATE IT?
8837	0	a	Personally I hate it ,but like most games much better when played with friends.
8838	0	a	If you dont know anyone that will play with you than dont bother
8839	0	a	its a really bad game brian
8840	0	a	I am apparently too stupid to play this game. Waste of $2.50.
8841	0	a	While I can see why people like this because of its extensive content, I found all of my playtime not really having fun, and more just boring grinding.
8842	0	a	Got old very quick. 2D minecraft.
8843	0	a	Bought a 4 pack of terreria for the kids....only one works....there are no instructions / info on how to get the onther 3 accounts to works ?????? well done....no emails..no nothing
8844	0	a	I've gathered a whole folder of games which are crap. This is one of them. - Oh, hi, Terraria. You're so popular! What am I supposed to be doing here? - LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN WILD! THERE'RE TONS OF POSSIBILITIES! - mhhhokay, uninstall
8845	0	a	Not to say that this is a  bad  game. It's not. It's just kinda mediocre. It is very difficult to get anything done unless you have the wiki open and have watched a million Lets Play's on it. While MineCraft is more focused on building, Terraria is more focused on loot and combat.  The combat is good, there's nothing at all wrong with it. Loot however, is a grind (like usual though), usually being built by yourself rather than finding it in chests. By the time you find those chests you'll be geared up for anything, and I found the items to be a fair bit useless by then.  Enemies are varied, and the fact that people populate your houses as you build them is a nice touch. But other than building a nice town and digging deeper, it got old fast. Despite all the cool armor and weapons and tools and all these cool toys to mess with, it just somehow got old. The loot from enemies and in chests didn't seem to keep pace with the items I made myself, and so I found little incentive to keep going.  Personally, I prefer Starbound. (Yes, I'm one of  those  people, to the fans of this game). Why? It's basically Terraria, but with goals and a quest line. It has everything this does, but it doesn't get boring for some reason. The Multiplayer in SB also works, unlike in this game for some reason. I can join big servers owned by rich hosts, but I can't even join my friends despite going through all the setup, using hamachi, using router, etc... Private servers would seem nice but nobody I've tried to play with can get it running. It's a shame.  For a few hours or so, this game will be enjoyable. I suggest getting it while it's on a sale or something, because that justifies the price. Even though I've played this game enough, both online and offline, I can't say I've played 9.99 worth of this game.  Now, you might enjoy it, but I just couldn't myself. It was okay, not BAD like my thumbsdown said. I just say to you if you contemplate getting this game, think about it some more, watch some videos on it, or buy the futuristic 'Terraria' called StarBound.
8846	0	a	Cheap for a reason. 2D 'adventure' minecraft-esque, but far more annoying with tiny blocks, and VERY slow building processes and general progress.
8847	0	a	I don't understand why people like this game. It's boring, repetitive, and all you do is run either left or right intill you find a place you wanna make a house or explore for dungeons. For me this game was boring for all of the reasons I listed above and even more smaller parts that are not worth saying. Others have told me 'Well if you played with friends it would be fun, single player is always boring in these games' well that's not true either. With friends you still have the same things, running left or right, repetitive dungeons, and over all still boring. I highly suggest not playing this unless you have played games like these and you like them. (This is coming from a FPS gamers Point Of View).
8848	0	a	So hard, i can't survive a second at night, the eyeballs are to over powered.
8849	0	a	Not able to play on mac.
8850	0	a	Not very good didnt enjoy, minecraft is well better
8851	0	a	One of the most frustrating games I've ever played. There are no instructions in the game, maybe that's part of the lure of the game but it irritates me that basic things aren't explained. I've talked with one of my friends who owns this game and he tells me that he loves this game and I want to as well, but it's extremely unforgiving. When you die you have to go back to where you died and pick up all your stuff, which irritates me because I have to go back to where I died and face the thing that killed me without my items.   My only advice to anyone picking up this game is to use a guide because otherwise you will be lost.
8852	0	a	So I just booted up terarria for the first time...   There seems to be an NPC next to me with a text buble next to his head, I should talk to him. [LEFT CLICK ON NPC] Oh crap, I've stabbed him! Come back buddy where are you going!? [NPC finds deep water-filled crevass and dives in without hesitation]. Wow. He just sunk right to the bottom. Hey, what is that green thing coming towards me at an incredible rate of-- ow, he's attacking me! BATTLE STATIONS! Wow, this sword really is a piece of [DEATH]  Ugh, ok, he's going down. [kills slime] Sweet, he dropped something, let's see what it -seriously!?- Another one attacking me already? Ok, i guess I'll just have to [DEATH]  Ok, this sword needs to be upgraded. How do I do that? That slime is in between me and my tutorial man -I'll call him Tutorio- but I've played plenty of games like this before so this should be simple. [PRESS E] Huh, nothing happened. [PRESS C] Still nothing. [Press Tab] nope, hey something's hitting [DEATH]  Ok game, give me a freaking second to figure things out. Hey, why are red numbers coming out of the tutorial man's head? Is he drowning?! OH COME ON! Seriously? Ok, I have to figure out a way to save him, army of slimes be damned. Here I come Tutorio! [NPC DEATH] [DEATH]  Ok, ok, ok. This is bad. I now have no idea what I'm doing. Aaaaand it looks like it's getting dark. Of course. Wow, really dark. Ok, seriously, I can't see much of, well, anything really. Now it's pitch black. My screen is literally black [DEATH]  [DEATH]  [DEATH]  Ok. [DEATH]  This is [DEATH]  ridiculous. [DEATH]  Seriously. [DEATH]  I'm not [DEATH]  having fun [DEATH]  anymore. [DEATH]  How do I [DEATH]  exit? [DEATH]  [PRESS ESC] Oh! THERE'S the crafting screen! [EXIT GAME] 
8853	0	a	a good time sink  oh wait did i say time sink, which might imply this game is remotely fun, because i meant WALLET SINK UGH WASTE OF MONEY
8854	0	a	I walked five yards, encountered some unkillable demon, uninstalled.
8855	0	a	While I like the concept I have found the game to be extremely grind-heavy. Between the interesting bits you have to spend hours just digging around. Might be fun with friends, though, but then, what isn't?
8856	0	a	This is the only game I've purchased in years that I wanted to return.  Don't get this stupid POS, buy Minecraft instead.
8857	0	a	Tried out this game because I enjoy open world exploration and building stuff in games.  After spending a little bit of time with it though, I just couldn't get into it. The game doesn't teach you how to play at all, forcing you to search the web to try to figure out what the heck you are supposed to do. On top of that, the game has strait up zero goals or anything for you to accomplish.  Maybe this game would've been more friend with a group of friends or something where you could come up with stuff to do together, but it was horribly boring solo.
8858	0	a	'It's a clone of Minecraft, just in 2D, that's desperately trying to be different from Minecraft' -- is what I was told when I asked about this game. My mistake was I didn't take it seriously.  The further review is only for Single Player mode, maybe Multiplayer has some charm in it, but I wouldn't know.  So, this game is mediocre, you walk around and dig for stuff. For no real reason that I could find other than to pave a road for yourself when you fall into some pit. So, you walk left and right (because it's only 2D, remember?) and do what? That's the question I couldn't find answer to. At times you get attacked by some monsters that come out of nowhere. They come in swarms and they're brainless - even flying ones have single pattern of movement. You gotta fight back. You have a sword, a shovel and an axe. The best option is obvious - you shovel flying ones to death, because sword and axe are useless against them (wut?).  And that's about all there is to this game. I enjoyed oldschool DOS version of Prince of Persia more. Personally, I believe buying it even on a sale was a mistake.
8859	0	a	bought the game on this account months ago and still no help from official forumon why it wont run. already reinstalled multiple time and reinstalled xna and frameworks multiple times
8860	0	a	this game could seriously benefit from some in-game info. only a few bare bones ideas for crafting are given to you, the rest you'll discover on the wiki. bookmark it now and read it in the downtime. there will be exploration (fun!) and monsters (lots of fun!) and quite a bit of grinding (never any fun!). i've gotten to the part where you mine ore in hell to get gear to fight the wall of flesh, but it is TEDIOUSLY SLOW. and for me, game breaking. might try to get back into it, but at present feel stifled.  i would like to add that everything up to this point was awesome. finding the npc's. building your little town. fending off the invading army. and the exploring! do sort of wish the inventory was a little bigger, but that's a small detail. really everything leading up to the WoF fight, fantastic. cannot recommend based on the material bottleneck at this point in the game.
8861	0	a	I found this game very frustrating and difficult. To be honest, I wasn't used to it, but I personally don't recommend this game unless you are up for a big challenge...
8862	0	a	anover bby gam i was trickt in2 buying. its ok to play once but after it suxs. very poor replayabilillitie. bby gam 6/10. Remember subskrib, lyk,favorit, and no h8. ty-Autism Kid no h8rs
8863	0	a	Abysmal controls weaken this derivative, tiresome almost-game.
8864	0	a	Worst controls ever, might have seen what the hype was all about if I could move anything with any ease.
8865	0	a	shot my self in the foot then bit off my hands so i didnt have the choice to play!
8866	0	a	'just play minecraft'
8867	0	a	i dig to the underworld, which by the way takes me two days, and i get tonnes of good stuff, then my files get corrupted and i lose it all! bullcrap
8868	0	a	I don't recommend this game for Windows 7 or newer, because: - the game crashes on start - it took me 2 hours to workaround the issue: on my system I had the newest .NET framework 4.5.1 installed. The game requires and ships with .NET framework 4.0, but due to newer version present, 4.0 is not installed. Uninstalling 4.5.1 and installing 4.0 took me 1 hour on Core i7, 6 GB DDR3 RAM, SSD system. And 1 hour to check few compatibility options and google searches for clues. - I don't think that is something an average user can do. - And check the store page: Is it worth it? My answer is NO!
8869	0	a	I just don't like it. Not surprised since I didn't like Minecraft either. Only paid like $3 so no big loss.
8870	0	a	Don't get me worng this game is good singleplayer that is.But when ever i try play with my firends they can never join nor can i join there servers with hamchi and with out its, its getting extremely annoying
8871	0	a	Everything about it is great exept the world file and player file corruption. I had played 114 Hours and lost all of it to file corruption
8872	0	a	its good
8873	0	a	I got bored to death,It's probably just me,I find it really confusing,just like Minecraft this game gives you little to no info on how to play and you gotta figure it out.That's one thing that throws me off.I like the style,the graphics are nice,but I don't like how 'help' is being given to you when you start,
8874	0	a	I hate this game and I'm upset that I wasted my money on it.
8875	0	a	Wait is this just 2D Minecraft? Multiplayer is a hassle to set up.
8876	0	a	Okay to be honest there is nothing good to say about this game, people say it is better then minecraft but it has nothing to compete with minecraft it is one of the worst survival games I have ever played. (worst 2.00$ I have ever spent)  4/10
8877	0	a	Hmm.. dunno how to put this because there are so many people find this game to be amazing. However, I have put more than 10 hours and I am struggling to have fun with it. Sure, the first few hours was fun because you have to find a way to survive the first night. After that.... I lost sense of purpose. I will dig down and keep on digging.. not much to find. I will chop off trees and keep on chopping and got more woods than I can use, I will build houses for NPCs but... finally got bored. Will craft few items here and there, nothing really exciting. Anyway, I will take a break.. and will probably come back to this game again sometime in the future. My opinion may change then, maybe....
8878	0	a	Silly tutorial, you have no clue what u should do in the beginning, and when the zombies show up, you're done anyways. Pathetic!
8879	0	a	I don't know why but when i try to play it decides not to work. :(
8880	0	a	omg the last time i played this it just crashed but my computer sucked anyway but last time i played it there wasnt to much to do like i saw tin and lead and was like wtf is this but that just makes this game even more fun getting stuff and learning what to do so all around good game so i do reccomend this game to anyone well i would but that is until you realize that theres this bug that if you play on a world for to long it makes your game crash and you cant get it back
8881	0	a	'Minecraft? Never heard of it.'
8882	0	a	this game gets very boring very fast.
8883	0	a	Pretty fun if you play with friends.
8884	0	a	Those who've played Minecraft for hours on end, this game will probably not be for you. It's a gather resources and build type of game but I just got bored after an hour or two. A 2d builder just isn't as satisfying as a 3d builder. You'll never get those 'Wow' moments when entering your own creations. They'll never look or feel as spacious as 3d worlds.
8885	0	a	This is just a 2d Minecraft alike game.It isn't that exciting.Yea if you have friend you could have a couple of hours of fun but if you buy this and your friends don't have this you're in for a bad time.
8886	0	a	tewawia is not on fiyoh
8887	0	a	this game made me ragequit within 15 mins of launch.   Some people may really enjoy it, but i thought the system was really frustrating and i think a lot of the mine and build fun was lost in the 2dSS. I get that it has a lot of cool content, but it just wasnt for me.
8888	0	a	Not really
8889	0	a	Oh man I'm sorry, I just can't. no. I can't recommend this any more so I've removed my review. We finally got a patch that was actual content update but honestly it's just... it's so outclassed by Starbound.  Now admittedly Starbound is still unfinished but it's still better in its unfinished state than Terraria. Its art is better, its worlds and gameplay are better, and when they FINALLY update again, Starbound is going to leap ahead in how much fun it is so I'm afraid, give Terraria a miss unless it's super cheap. Sorry guys!
8890	0	a	we need terraria for mac!!!! its so boring to watch the people who have windows play!!!
8891	0	a	Buy starbound instead
8892	0	a	Terraria is fun and a great buy for any Minecraft fan looking to try something new but still play something very familiar. There is so much to do in the game from exploring deep underground to finding terrifying foes to building your dream home. I'd definitely recommend playing this game with a group of friends because it is a lot more fun and you can accomplish more faster.  Much like Minecraft though, the game can get very repetitive and seem like there is nothing to do once you have gotten higher level weapons and armor. The game could also use a better inventory/organizing system and DLC content (I know fans wouldn't mind paying a few extra bucks for something new in the game). Overall, Terraria is pretty solid for an indie game but I wouldn't say it's worth the money if not on sale or bought in a 4-pack.
8893	0	a	I don't know what to say. I didn't enjoy the game whatsoever.... Sorry guys
8894	0	a	this game is fun but when you've played for weeks and then everything on the game breaks and everything youve played gets deleted every time you open the game it gets annoying the players and worlds ive worked on have been deleted and corrupted too many times in a period of 4 days. this game is trashy and buggy
8895	0	a	Played it once long ago and had it in my head that i loved it so i re-bought it (after having it on a previous steam account ages ago) but really can't get on with it anymore.  Soundtrack is pretty sub par and dull. Gameplay can be very repetitive with some weapons feeling absurdly overpowered. Visuals don't quite have the charm to them which a game like this truly needs.
8896	0	a	i got it and it wont load
8897	0	a	WHY CANT I PLAY AS MY BEST CHARICTER!!!!!!!!
8898	0	a	I spent $1.99 on this game, and I feel like that money has gone to waste. The multiplayer is complex: you have to enter in an ip and port; you have to sign up for most servers. All in all, not worth the cash for me, even on sale.  However, I have noticed that this is a popular game. People clock in a lot of hours into this game, for reasons I'll never know.
8899	0	a	this game is a virus. it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing doesnt let me open this shet and league of legends and dots 2 is better than this shet. go play hearthstone 420 yolo swag â™¥â™¥â™¥
8900	0	a	Terribe game unresponsive controls with attacking being almost impossible. Looks like fun however trying to stop yourself dieing and unintuative crafting controls make me wish is was runecraft
8901	0	a	'I wish I was minecraft' it cries form a decade it does not belong in.
8902	0	a	really bad
8903	0	a	This game use to be a simple cool game but ever since they did the BIG updates its gotten a lot worse :( i used to love this game now i hate it sorry peeps who love it im done with it.
8904	0	a	Basically very addicting game. Once you beat it, it then becomes boring as hell. Don't buy...
8905	0	a	I bought this game in a four-pack and gave the other copies to friends, I ended up playing this much more than they did. The sandbox survival game craze was really picking up at the time this launched, and I liked digging and finding stuff in Minecraft, in spite of the problems I had with that game. I still had fun exploring and discovering things. I didn't care about crafting, or building, or fighting monsters, I was captivated by my sheer childlike sense of wonder.  At a glance, you might look at Terraria and think that it is a fun and engaging experience, and you would be right to guess that it befits the tropes that Minecraft ran through so well. However, once you get past all of the good elements, elements which Minecraft emulates perfectly for you, you have entered a game held back by a single flaw so frustrating that you should know not to ever buy the game, not even on a whim.  That element is the combat, which consists of single clicks to stab with a sword or to throw a boomerang. What could have worked is held back by obnoxious design choices. Randomly generated 2D terrains prevent you from ever escaping anything, zombies have too much health, enemies all do too much damage, and the platforming is a big time enemy that the game forces you to endure simultaneously alongside all these other wretched elements. If you are to die at night, which lasts as long as the f**king day, you are respawned at a default position in the middle of the night f**ked once again by all of the monsters that hit you for tons of damage and knock you around the place in this stupidly treacherous environment. Yes, Minecraft doesn't have good or fun combat, either, but at least the existence of a third dimension made it more possible to avoid things you didn't want to fight. Being chased by enemies in this game basically ends up with you running into a cliffside, sitting in a building for several minutes until night ends, or attempting your best at the terrible click-spam combat.  The idea of difficulty in this game is simply deciding how much you want to lose on death, if anything. The difficulty does not effect how annoying or dangerous the monsters actually are, so you might as well set it to the easiest to minimize the horrid punishment of combat in this game.  Terraria stops being an enjoyable experience once you make it to night, all of the bad design choices and frustrations make certain of that. Overall the worst game I have ever purchased on Steam. I am bothered that it sold as well that it did, but it was timed perfectly to feed off of Minecraft's popularity. Thanks developers, for creating a game where all of the mechanics and elements are necessary but not all of them are enjoyable.
8906	0	a	Its a 2D copy of minecraft AKA a peice of junk
8907	0	a	Game is meh. Such a hassle to even try to play with friends. Waste of $5
8908	0	a	This game is honestly horrible, I bought it for Mac and over the years it became a Windows game. I wasted ten dollars, on a game that isn't even updated on Mac anymore. Yes, the overall platform is awesome and has smooth graphics, but the developers who changed the game from Mac and Windows, to only Windows are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
8909	0	a	it doesn't mean i hate this game,.....i just don't know â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ what to do in it,...because i don't know how to play it :'c
8910	0	a	its fun at first if you got someone who knows everything, unless you do it takes 1 hour to find out how to make somenthing and make it.... if its a pickaxe.......
8911	0	a	Can't play... friend is using Library. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8912	0	a	 Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥   I have never had a more boring and bland experience in my life, and I've played current TF2. The game is hard to get into, and when you  do  get the jist of things, it ends up being a bad game overall.  3/10
8913	0	a	There is a certain knowledge floor to this game that makes it difficult to get into without friends.   Simply put, its not worth playing solo.
8914	0	a	Had to delete my previous positive review. The last update has completely screwed my game. Hope this trend of the Steam version of games being the worst ends soon.
8915	0	a	I forgot to downvote this wana be mine craft
8916	0	a	Why the hell would you check for bad reviews?   BUY THIS GAME!
8917	0	a	i love this game but sadly i cant recommend it.   player respawn times take so long, i used to love how after dying you could get right back in the game and run back to were you died if you wanted to get back what you dropped but now its 10 seconds and feels like a harsh punishment even on a single player normal world making it feel like a pain to even play. i want to get right back in i dont play games for any kind of realism i play to have fun and to get in to the game, but that comes to a grinding halt after death  there was a huge update recently and i really want to play, they added achievements and so much more but the 10 second long respawn is just ridiculous and kills the mood i have for playing.  if i can ever force myself to play again and get past the stupid respawn times and feel like im having fun again i'll change my review. but for now im dissatisfied with my favorite game
8918	0	a	WAIT HOLD ON, before you read this I would like to say a few things, no I am not a minecraft fanboy I actually do not like the game in its current form, and no I am not a hater because I have an opinion, so let's begin, terraria is the most boring game I have played in a long time, it's not a bad game but you just click and kill things easily, now compare that to minecraft the most common comparative it's combat is pretty much the same but the 3Ds of the game make combat feel more open apart from just standing and clicking, building however is much better in terraria but it only gets that from its 2Ds as there are thousands of options to choose from, same with weaponry and armour, but now for the part fanboys will burn me for... Exploration in minecraft you get to explore for pretty much forever and I don't know about terraria, note my time played. But that doesn't excuse again the perspective, I know it can be done right but it makes surviving, thriving and exploring really easy, if you see something before it reaches you or even sees you you can just walk away, In minecraft you have to see it, and there are 3 ways compared to terrarias 2 terraria it's kill or walk away, minecraft due to its 3Ds you can sneak by it, terraria is not a bad game, infact you might like it for the reasons I mention but I just don't like it or recommend it to the majority of people.  Problems: 2D perspective is bad for gameplay AI is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid there is way to much stuff for 2 options around something  Overall 4/10
8919	0	a	I WANT THIS TO WORK FOR MY MAC!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW DO I DO THIS?????
8920	0	a	The game refuses to launch on windows 10
8921	0	a	why buy it when you cant even PLAY IT??!! 
8922	0	a	why is this game so popular
8923	0	a	Extreme mode is like wiping your â™¥â™¥â™¥ with sandpaper....would not recomend
8924	0	a	Here i am still waiting for the mac version i have the game cuz i tought the mac and linux version would come out with 1.3 but i guess not ;/
8925	0	a	This game keeps on failing on loading worlds for some reason then I hit load backup then it takes me into a game of a black screen and my hotbar the game then crashes. I then can't join that world again because it says its an 'unknown' world and it does the same thing with the black screen. So I lose my whole world with all the items I had in the chests and all the buildings! I cannot reccommend the game until this is fixed as to because I could be a lot farther into the game without this it's so annoying and I dont feel like putting hard work into my houses and into the game!
8926	0	a	ehh not really fun....
8927	0	a	Terraria is a fantastic game. Incredibly creative and full of differences from Minecraft. Or at least, that's what i'd say, if something didn't change my opinion entirely. Me and my friend decided to make a multiplayer world. We've played for probably 15+ hours on it, and worked so, so very hard. Today, I opened Terraria, picked out my character and selected the world. Um... I.... selected the.... um.... Where's my world?! I found it was replaced with another world with no name, and the difficulty was changed from expert to normal. It said 'Unknown World', when I looked at the size. Upon opening it, I was left with an all black screen except for the item hub and an immediate crash. I've looked all day for a solution and all I could find was 'There is no fix for a corrupted world yet.' Honestly, now I feel like I've wasted money and 3 days. Do NOT buy Terraria until this bug is fixed. I can't even process how 3+ days of work can be gone so instantly. Terraria, you've cheated me. I will not be playing Terraria until this is fixed. I'm so incredibly sad, and I highly recomend you bring your buiseness elsewhere. There are other games on Steam you could buy and not be a waste of money. My Summer from this point on is ruined.
8928	0	a	The Slimes suck
8929	0	a	just beat the last boss on expert didn't get my end bag thank you developers for making this game suck for me v.v.
8930	0	a	Takes forver to switch resolutions and at 1080p you can't see a damn thing. Game froze while generating structures and then it's like a side scrolling minecraft. It wasn't fun before the new patch and it isn't any fun now.
8931	0	a	Been playing for the last week and now I can't continue. Once my world converted to hardmode I read up on demon alters to bring some new ores to my world. Turns out, every alter you break has a 66% chance to convert some 1 block into corruption somewhere in the world. 1 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing block that spreads out to other blocks. What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.   I want to contain the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ corruption in an area. I don't want to look for a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ needle in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ haystack. I don't have a problem making gold farms. I don't have a problem cleansing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because I have the stupid cleansing gun. But I don't want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up my world with stupid tunnels to hell every 80 blocks just so my cleansing gun can purge this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this game mechanic.   'Begone, Evil!' is the achievement you get from destroying one alter. Begone, evil my â™¥â™¥â™¥. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Minecraft doesn't even do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like this.
8932	0	a	sucks
8933	0	a	I like how just scrolling through the negatives, people are just not agreeing with any of the reviews because their wet dreams of this game are too strong. But in all seriousness, this game is pretty stale, even with the creative aspect, sure its fun to build something, and that's it. Everything else is just a slightly different version of the same, boring thing. To be honest this game gets more praise than deserved, but that's just my opinion. Well, that's enough for this review, disagree away fanboys, you'll only be proving a point.
8934	0	a	Dont ever get this game if you are playing on a laptop. When my battery died and i got to see if i can play my game again my character was erased! ALL HIS CONTENT TOO he didnt even have sprite it was just a blank box but when i made a new character my other worlds were still in tack
8935	0	a	My brother was obsessed with this game. My mum told him to get off for dinner. My brother kicked her in her pregnant belly. Nah im just kidding my mum isnt pregnant.
8936	0	a	I never wanted a game that would get me so addicted that I would end up reaching 100 hours and counting... I never wanted a game that would turn all my dreams into a 2d game that i got for sale for $2.50 (in which i got from selling trading cards). I never wanted a game that would make me so frustrated I would do 100 fishing quests just to get one silly item to make a cellphone. I never wanted a game that no one told me was a curse. Ever... see ya. got to go purify my world so that all my 75 hours of work doesnt go to waste...
8937	0	a	Cant start up the game 10/10

8942	0	a	So ever since the 1.3 update, I've had constant crashing with the cloud save feature on and without it on, Terraria just randomly resets deleting all my characters and worlds. I lost 87 hours of work all because of this update, and it's just irritating.
8943	0	a	Cant See The Game On Screen Its Open But My Computer Says It Is Not
8944	0	a	I could never get this game to load.
8945	0	a	What why are you looking at negative reviews? THIS IS TERRARIA!
8946	0	a	Before this game i had a group of many many friends, then they made a server for this. Its all they play. Terraria killed my friends. r.i.p â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s early 2015- late 2015
8947	0	a	I thought I'd like it but...meh. If you don't like the way it looks then don't buy it.
8948	0	a	Save me from the nothing i've become.
8949	0	a	This game is similar to Minecraft in that it's all about exploring to gather resources, fighting enemies and bosses for resources and items, and building structures. If you really like those things then you'll have some fun with this game. If you have friends to play with you'll enjoy the game even more.  However, if you're like me then it will be hard for this game to hold your interest. I really like it when games have memorable stories and characters. This game obviously isn't trying to go for that, but then I need it to have really fun gameplay to compensate. The gameplay in Terraria isn't particularly interesting until you've played for a ton of hours to get good items, and getting there just doesn't feel like a worthwhile investment of my time.  My favorite games tend to have a short singleplayer with exciting gameplay and environments, or a highly replayable competitive multiplayer. Terraria is practically the opposite of all that, it's one of those games where you aren't given a specific mission to accomplish so you need to figure out what you want to do. Some people could probably play it for hundreds of hours and not be bored, but that is just not the case for me.
8950	0	a	Help me i has update the game but the version still 1.3.0.6
8951	0	a	I'm not too fond of this game, but - it's a cheap bit of entertainment for you and your friends that requires a minimal platform to run.  The gameplay feels a bit static, Gear is all. Gear is unrealistic, but it's a colorful, cartoony world where anything can happen. There are bossfights that are enjoyable, and there are large worlds for providing a lot of room for exploration with friends. Singleplayer seems to get old fast, however. Though, that's most sandbox titles. Eventually you reach all four corners of the playground.  Combat is basic, the game feels like it lacked polish last time I played. I think they updated it once or twice since, I don't know. I can't say for certain that I will ever play this game again.  What this game really does well are its boss fights, despite its mechanics, and cartoony style. If you like cartoony, power to you. The boss fights are great, but its hard to hold up the entire game with just that. I suppose PvP in a large multiplayer server might be good, but I was never motivated to take it that far.  For the price of $10, playing singleplayer? I give this game a solid 5/10.  With a total hours a bit under 30, having played it on a friend's laptop a few times and a bit of offline play, I suppose I got $10 worth of content.  NOTE: I write this now, as it might be important to mention. I did NOT pay for this game. Someone bought it for me as a gift, and as such, it might influence my perspective on value. It was not my ten dollars I paid.
8952	0	a	WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYD NOW RECOMMENDED #WASTE OF MONEY
8953	0	a	The developers of this game (Re-Logic) have confirmed that they have been deleting NEGATIVE reviews of this game, and claiming any negative or suspicious review content as copyright infringement.  Some reviewers have come out and revealed that Re-Logic had PAID them to say good things about Terraria and spread positive buzz.  The main developer has said he made this game as close to Minecraft as he could without infringing, only for money, thanks to the Minecraft craze.  This review may also be removed due to astro-turfing.  Don't support this kind of behavior.
8954	0	a	I might be the only one in the world that thinks this, but this game is just f**kng terrible in my opinion. Buy minecraft instead of this,
8955	0	a	eh boring, good for kids, but i just got tired of it.
8956	0	a	I bought Terraria in the 2014 summer sale, and toyed with it on and off until a few weeks before the 1.3 patch. After the patch I began to play the game more seriously and attempt a completion. Unfortunately, the 1.3 patch and Steam integration make my game crash approximately every few hours. Even with this problem, I've been happy to save, quit and load back up periodically.  Today, 17 hours into Hardmode, I made it through my first blood moon with only 1 death. I quickly reclaimed all of my gear and continued playing. Approximately 20 minutes later the game crashed. This time, for whatever reason, every piece of equipment on my character was deleted in the crash. Some of it totally unretreivable without starting over on a new world. Frankly, it has immediately turned a game I was growing to love, into a crash engine that causes more frustration than gameplay.  If and when I can reliably play the game without countless hours of grinding deleting itself at random during a crash, I may pick it back up. Until then, I won't touch with with a pole. I highly recommend saving yourself the headache and avoiding Terraria here until the 1.3 patch is fully integrated into Steam.
8957	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because its not on mac 
8958	0	a	7/10 Good game, but crashes alot.
8959	0	a	its not funny you just run and build â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! 
8960	0	a	i never got my worlds so i can not download the all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing builders worker shop
8961	0	a	this game is totaly s''t you have to be a expert the at the game the first time you play to craft at all 
8962	0	a	Terraria is loved by many, but I don't know why. It's less user friendly than Dwarf Fortress.  The game is tight lipped about its basic controls, and this is something that you just can't afford unless the controls are very simple and very intuitive. They aren't.  For some utterly bizarre reason, the default settings don't pause the game when you open the main menu, so you have no respite from the enemies who WILL rip you to shreds even while you are trying to learn what button or mouse click you use to swing your sword and defend yourself from them. But the menu and its confusing submenus don't even offer that information. There might be a key binding submenu somewhere; I wouldn't know, I never found it.  I could find a few wikis with a Google search, but none of them mentioned basic controls either.  I managed to fumble my way blindly through the first elements of combat and building... and then I made a mistake, as one is wont to do when fumbling around blindly. I built a wall around my character from which she could not escape. Now I needed to know how to unbuild something. One would think that in a building game, this would be an essential tool to anyone, one the designers would want to be sure you understood from the beginning. But there was no help for me that I could find either in-game or in an online community.  My only recourse was to blindly click and swing everything, flinging my weapons gaily away while zombies chewed on my unguarded toes and a block in front of my forehead prevented me from moving.  It turns out that the solution was that I had to use a specific item, the pickaxe, on any block or item I wanted to unbuild. I discovered this after about 13 minutes of frustrated, blind experimentation.  The devs claim that this game is not a Minecraft clone, but I refute them. How in the blazing hells do you expect anyone who isn't a Minecraft player to intuitively understand that in order to unbuild things you need to hit them with a pickaxe? At least in Minecraft you CAN remove things without a specific tool, it's merely less efficient. Here, no such luck.  Tutorials don't need to be explicit or in your face, but if your controls are complex, or gods help you unintuitive, they MUST be present. Terraria and all its wikis completely fail to give a damn about introducing you to them. I have met seasoned players who can't answer me when I ask them how to control whether a placed chair faces right or left.  It doesn't deserve its legacy. Play Dwarf Fortress instead. It's not simple either, but a Google search and a few clicks can get you a user-friendly tutorial. It's the father of games like Terraria and Minecraft, and can compete with them in potential for building awesome things. It has a huge dedicated user-base, tons of assisting tools, a well-maintained wiki of virtually any information you could want, and it's completely free, funded by donations alone.
8963	0	a	never again will i enjoy the torture of this game it has too many glitches fixing the buges with expert mode would be a good start also a good idea for this game is not to have a 10 min wait just to respawn or geting to press any key to respawn, also in expert mode its not allowed to one shot you if there mobs that spawn too often like hell bats and eater of souls
8964	0	a	this game is bad it lags to much my guy got screwed up now i cant play as him and the moon lord is over the top hard and the towers are bad and time wasteing the game should be rated 4/10
8965	0	a	Even the bad reviews are good    This game is awesome
8966	0	a	Ever had that one game that all your friends love but you cant stand? This is that game
8967	0	a	Very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and bad no good plot. even g wowf3 was better this game sux
8968	0	a	OMFG. Why this game doesnt have Chinese!!
8969	0	a	Hit the 24 hour mark on this great game when the name of my character turned red. My character and my world were both corrupted forcing me to delete them. I do recomend you getting this game when they fix this problem. 24 hours gone, Not Cool.
8970	0	a	Yup. Edit: If only I was able to forward my ports I'd enjoy this game more. But no.
8971	0	a	this game is so boring firetruck it         
8972	0	a	I typically enjoy these types of games, but had trouble getting into this one. I'm sure the experience is better if you are playing with other people. Personally, I found Starbound to be a more enjoyable experience.
8973	0	a	No. Just don't buy this lil piece of cr@p
8974	0	a	I bought the 4 pack so i could play with my son and friends. After watching multiple youtube vidoes and hours of trying, it is impossible to set up a server to play with him. I regret buying this. There doesn't appear to be any ingame support and it shouldn't be this hard.   I do not recommend.
8975	0	a	this is dumb. I paid $1.25 for it..I kinda want my money back
8976	0	a	Can i sell this??? 
8977	0	a	this game is terrible i wouldnt recomend annyone to buy it or invest their time into it

8983	0	a	its ok but not very good 3/10
8984	0	a	Just boring.
8985	0	a	I found this game similar to minecraft. But Terraria is diffferent, no beds classical pixal sandbox adventure and you dont know what to do after a while. I would recomend Starbound why? You will see
8986	0	a	i just went on and i lost everthing that i had, all my saves are gone and now im really mad!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8987	0	a	so......feels so retro because of the graphivs. Buid system built like a house of cars. Vage as dust mission objectives. 10-10 plz help my addoction 
8988	0	a	The game is broken. The game refuses to accept any keyboard inputs other than the space, shift, and tab buttons, and therefore unplayable as intended. Do not buy.
8989	0	a	no cause some of you may press shift to put somefing in the invetory i tryid and i keep frogeting that it goes to the trash so i endedup deleting 10 op item because of it so f you and have fun
8990	0	a	Why are you looking at negative reviews for terraria? What the hell?
8991	0	a	it dont want to start if i can get a refund please do it because i pay to play  windows 7
8992	0	a	-
8993	0	a	amazing game.but this game is for kids that are 8 years old - 6 years old, the first 3-4 hours of the game will be fun, but then it will be boring,minecraft is better.
8994	0	a	cant host or join lan, cant host or join seaver. tried everything jumped every hoops 10 time, nothing works, if you want roll the dice and see if it happens to you be my guess but im so done with this game.
8995	0	a	I don't like this version I CAN'T OPEN THE DOOR! Idk why I'm not sure if I need a mouse I have one but I Idk if I should use it. Doors, chests etc don't work and I'm getting fustrated. Can someone tell me if I need a mouse for the Mac? 
8996	0	a	it does'nt work so i click it again guess what happens it does'nt work-_- please fix it or ealse steam is the worst game selling company! 
8997	0	a	I whant my Money back
8998	0	a	Beware the multiplayer servers in this game. I had an especially bad expierience with  jteeria.net . They refused to deliver a $25 expansion that I had ordered, and banned my account when I finally disputed the transaction.
8999	0	a	This game needs to die
9000	0	a	Hate it.
9001	0	a	Every game has a learning curve. Most complicated games at least have walkthroughs for how to play the game.  Terraria skipped that and said 'Suck it players'. When/If you start playing, I suggest you look up what to do online otherwise you will end up hiding in a hand-dug-hole from zombies for 2.4 hrs and never play the game again.
9002	0	a	Fix the god damn multiplayer Via steam connection.... Takes us 10 attempts to make it work.
9003	0	a	make it 98% off!
9004	0	a	DIG,BULID,MINE as soon as they fix the game. the bug is the play button dosnt work.pls tell me how to fix it if you did.
9005	0	a	I wanted so bad to like this game. I can see the reason peolple can quickly get hooked but i cant get to that point. It really doesnt give any information on how to play the game so you will have to go on tips and tricks on how to play the game. Everytime i go to explore i just die and forced to start over again. Its just so hard and there is so much too learn and it can get overwheming for noobs like me. Im glad that this game was cheap because i would have been upset. This game is not for everybody.
9006	0	a	Go back to the recommended. i recommend this.
9007	0	a	This is not a very good game and I regret buying it. I guess I'm just not into games with no plot, no direction, no goals, and no explanation as to what to do or how to succeed. Having to consult external sources to figure out how to play a game is not desirable to me. $2.50 was too much.
9008	0	a	dont hate me plezzzzzzzz but 0.1/0.11 haha no plz seriously? nooooo seriouslyyyy??? noooo seriousleeee? nooooooooo buy when you dnt wnt 2 coz â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gaem
9009	0	a	this gane sucks
9010	0	a	Waste of money! Bought it today and it doesn't work at all. All it has been doing is crashing and freezing! I do not recommend buying this game until they fix the problem.
9011	0	a	I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT WORK START FOR SOME REASON I TRY TO REINSTALL 5 TIMES AND I HAVE A GAMING LAPTOP PLSSS FIX I REELY LOVE THIS GAME
9012	0	a	Doesn't support 2560x1080 resolution. Unplayable for me
9013	0	a	Not suitable graphics card!!!!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME I WAS PLAYING IT AN HOUR AGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9014	0	a	I'll start off by saying that I only got the game because it seems to have some sort of rabid fanbase.   That being said, I cannot, for the life of me, understand how anyone could find this game entertaining. The fact that I had to even leave the game and hit Google just to figure out what the game wanted from me and what I should do is off-putting on its own. Add in the fact that mobs seem to be sucked into your gravitational pull rather than being free-roaming creatures that you come across as you explore the world and you get one annoyed player. But if you're into that kind of thing, have at it!
9015	0	a	I dont get the point of this game without another player.
9016	0	a	wow i got hacked. i killed a nymph and wasted so much time on this WHY.
9017	0	a	Stuped game wont load up when i hit start and i only played it once last night so yea im done with this game its sad it seemd like a good game for the 9 hours that o played it
9018	0	a	0/10 Not enough Yo-Yo's
9019	0	a	One of the worst games I've played.  Terraria is a good game. ON THE CONSOLE! It seems like it was meant for the console, since on the PC version, things are much more difficult to do.  For example, pillaring up is something I do often on the console when I need to get to a higher level. On the console version, I point the right stick down, hold jump, and hold the block place button. On the PC version, you have to create platforms (not the item, but platforms out of blocks). You can't make a pillar on the PC version without something else to stand on, wings, etc. Another example is combat, which is an extraordinarily large part of Terraria. Maneuvering your character is harder on the PC version, thus skillful combat is impossible. Another thing that's missing is quick select. On the console version, you can bind certain inventory items to different buttons on the D-pad, so if you're fighting, you can quickly take out a health potion, gun, or sword. Or if you're mining, you can have torches in a slot, a mining tool in another, and an umbrella (an umbrella makes you fall slower) in another. The PC version has nothing like that.  All in all, I'm sad. Sad that I wasted my money on this godawful game. If you like playing video games, get a console. PCs were meant for work.
9020	0	a	well i would now like to have a refund because on my computer it doesnt even begin to function so i literally spent ten dollars on nothing
9021	0	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9022	0	a	This Game Sucks
9023	0	a	I had no friends before I bought this game, not the legendary p2000 god sido comes to my house everynight to punch me in the throat.
9024	0	a	GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9025	0	a	I Loved it. but then. 1.3.0.8 came. then all my things were GONE. including my friends. they were talking to me about it. i dont know whats going on. this game is broken.
9026	0	a	Terrible, only buy and play it if you are desperate for something to play
9027	0	a	Wonderful game........execpt no pause, which means I have t exit the world, and then reenter away from where I was working, just so I dont die if i need to pause the game....very inconcient.  *Edit* auto pause is not a good slution for me still running in to a like problem.
9028	0	a	Terrarias great. one of the first games ive bought on PC and is what introduced me to the master race. But now, the more things they have added is kind of overwhelming and its hard to keep track of everything. I used to love this game but theyve changed so much I just can't get into it anymore.
9029	0	a	tim my m8 sold his lyf eto dis geme
9030	0	a	Every time I load in a pre existing world after leaving one causes steam to entirely crash...It gets really damn annoying after a while.
9031	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game off and get Minecraft! its waaaaay better
9032	0	a	this game is still broken for windows 10 creators please fix this now or uninstall
9033	0	a	it dosent even work on my computer 
9034	0	a	Fun little survival game, although no tutorial. Hard to get into the hang of things without light and NPC's guiding you. After one hour still not sure what to do. Do I stay or do I try to leave house? Where do I use coins? Greatly could have benefited from a tutorial. Multiplayer didn't work.  From a F2P perspective it is a okay game, I got upto Tin armor/weapons in my time, then it just got repetitive. Huge P2P limitations if you want better armor. Needs more stuff to do except surive.
9035	0	a	loved 1.2, not a big fan of 1.3 though.
9036	0	a	Why are you reading the negative reviews! BUY THIS GAME ALREADY!
9037	0	a	What are you doing in the 'No' Area. Slap that Add to cart button NOW!
9038	0	a	Terraria is a great spinoff of the anime series Pokemon, set in the year of 1942. In Terraria, you must learn to accept your differences and cope with change following the third World War.
9039	0	a	i cant get on my mac and there is no beta to open the game up do i need to get the dlc first to play or something :(
9040	0	a	its boring 
9041	0	a	it keep not working for me i did undownload a  help some one
9042	0	a	Stick better to Super mario. This Jump&amp;Run here has maybe better water physics but a major problem in the Movement of the Character.
9043	0	a	.
9044	0	a	Im sorry but to me this game just isnt good, if you join late you have no chance. And everbody that likes this game always tries REALLY hard to defend it and its rwally annoying.
9045	0	a	Buggy, crash-prone, and has NO ABILITY TO ZOOM. (or it might -- I tried to launch it, and it decided a crash was appropraite. Since it took that position, I figured unisntalling and a public refuation would be a good rebuttal.)
9046	0	a	seawsdsa
9047	0	a	it wont let me play my worlds
9048	0	a	It's kind of ridiculous that I have to have two licenses and two separate Steam accounts in order to play this game with my son.  I'm not ready to make him his own Steam account.  It's not happening anytime soon so I guess I won't be playing multiplayer with this game. I'd much rather play Starbound anyway.
9049	0	a	Terraria Needs More Worlds. It get's Boring with just one and it needs more people.
9050	0	a	this game freezes every 5 secounds if not that when i click play game it will freeze 
9051	0	a	Everyone tells me I don't find it fun because I haven't gotten into it far enough, but what's the point of playing if the whole experience isn't fun? I don't want to be bored half to death, HOPING that I can finally get to the point where I can actually have fun. I want ALL of the game to be fun and engrossing. I wouldn't recommend it, but you should probably take the side of most Terraria players, as I'm the minority here.  Starbound is so much better  3/10
9052	0	a	The game is pretty boring; I had to consult a wiki to find recepies more than Minecraft (and that is something to say!) It took me forever and a day to figure out you need back walls in addition to your regular walls so no monsters can get in (rediculous idea) I got bored playing it a little past a half hour (90% of the time was trying to figure out controls, dying, and aiming to build a back wall...) Wouldn't recommend
9053	0	a	my computer says that the file is invalid. I already installed it for the 4th time and nothing happens
9054	0	a	STOP LOOKING AT THE BAD COMMENTS AND BUY THIS GAME.  The amount of content in this dumbfounds me. This game requires patience, strategy and for you to enjoy yourself. It succeeds in doing so. The entire game is an exciting blast from the moment when you spawn, to where you fist pump after beating the mid game boss, and when you scream at your friends after an amazing loot drop. Which reminds me that playing with friends is even more bliss than playing by yourself, and you odn't even need to pay a host, you just click host and play, then boom terraria has found a server for YOUR world to be hosted on and the save data from the multiplayer world will transer for to the single player world. Buy it now.
9055	0	a	'Nothing is impossible' Getting into this game was, for me.  I haven't had much time played but it seemed a very basic game: you mess around building some pixel walls and recruit NPCs to join your 'village'. I see people having fun on it on twitch, which confuses me because I found it really easy and basic.   Different tastes I guess :)
9056	0	a	The game was ok for the sale but got boring quick with buddies, I prefer starbound for its adventure
9057	0	a	If you like bad graphics from the early 90's, this game may be for you. Typical game play: walk left or right, your screen turns dark, and then you die.  I can't understand why anyone likes this game.
9058	0	a	While you CAN do tons of amazing things in this game, as stated by other reviews, I found the game itself to be boring and frustrating. This, as you can imagine, is somewhat of a problem, seeing as how you have to play the game in order to progress and be able to do awesome things and have fun. Can not in good conscience endorse, if you are looking for a similar game because the idea/description/videos intrigue you, I would recommend Starbound (also available on Steam). Please note: Although at the time of writing, Starbound is an early release game, and as such still in beta, it is quite functional, very enjoyable, and constantly improving.
9059	0	a	lmao this game is terrible. call of duty and minecraft are 69 billion trillion time better XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 
9060	0	a	Terren is Good Game.   This is what I like. You play. Blue man is looking from the outer edges of univern.

9070	0	a	Good game but crashes my steam ever 5 minutes and all my save progress is lost didnt use to do this before
9071	0	a	I love Terraria. Played it on friend's computers, played it on the Playstation 4 - I really enjoy the game. So, when I got the opportunity to purchase it for myself on my computer, of course I would! After downloading, I start it up, ready to begin another new world - when suddenly a 'Windows Update' upon launch fails. I try and try again, getting the same result. I'd recommend this game to anyone who can actually play it, but considering I can't (and I fear many others may not be able to as well) I'm afraid I do not recommend this and will be requesting a refund.
9072	0	a	I don't like the game no more it got modded too much I want a refund please need to but another GAME!?

9081	0	a	This game sucks. Results in broken keyboard, and intense rage.
9082	0	a	This game is REALLY repetitive and very bland, no actual story line, etc. -5/10 I gave up on this game a long time ago and I found out why. This has been my review for 'this' game.
9083	0	a	This game is not for me, nothing to do.
9084	0	a	For the same price, you'll take more pleasure with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9085	0	a	Every time i launch it it will let me create a character but as soon as I try to create a world if CRASHES. IT'S VERY ANNOYING THAT I JUST SPENT MONEY ON A GAME THAT WONT EVEN RUN WITH OUT CRASHING BEFORE I CAN EVEN PLAY IT 
9086	0	a	Okay- I changed my opinion. They have messed this game up since the early days; I used to love this game. I'm saddned and enraged by some of the changes.
9087	0	a	After you get all of the achievements, find out how to cheat, kill all the bosses, fully upgrade your character, and build a base, there is nothing else to do. Haven't touched this game in a while because of that.
9088	0	a	I recommend this game for DELETION! This is an AWFUL game. I played it for all of 15 minutes just trying to get the hang of the controls and have to say it wasn't worth it. The game is just awful. It's a terrible, terrible clone of Minecraft. Just buy that instead and stear clear of this travesty. Big thumbs DOWN!
9089	0	a	this game sucks
9090	0	a	why would anyone want this it's literally just mario maker only harder smh
9091	0	a	At the game's current state, I wouldn't recommend it. I'm not at all against the content of the game, its exciting and all and its content is fantastic, but if you don't have a website of constant spoilers or just happen to know to use the guide every step of the way, while also happening to trigger all the bosses by accident before being bored of it and calling it a Minecraft clone, you can semi-muster a blind playthrough. I respect the game for much more than that but too many of my friends have played it for 1 hour and called it bad based on a bunch of spoilers versus their immediate experience.  There NEEDS to be more in-game documentation so that these spoilers dont get through. even some of the crafting items that show up, like the frost moon present shows it on the tooltip. It also shows ectoplasms as a crafting ingredient, which may prompt people to look it up and it just spoils everything too fast.  A game like this shouldn't need to be spoiled so quickly. That's my only real reason for not recommending the game at its current state. I'll change it if they fix this. Hopefully Terraria Otherworld addresses this glaring issue.
9092	0	a	the whole tier/balance system is actually outdated. tiers can be easily skipped. there is only a rough limitation up to certain points in the overall game progress. it requires complete revision which is at this advanced stadium of the game practically impossible and thus not feasible. in other words = dont add, continue aka 'Terraria II'
9093	0	a	It's a boring and complicated game, all you do is grind and look up the controls because of how easy to forget they are.
9094	0	a	I didnt liked it that much. not my style
9095	0	a	It's really great if you like mindless â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 90% of the time and some kindof cool boss fights 1% of the time. The other 9% is you wondering why you haven't asked for a refund.
9096	0	a	Oops wrong button
9097	0	a	I said this on the playstore, I'll say it here.  I used to love Terraria, But now it's so broken nobody can play anymore. GET OFF YOUR LAZY ASSES AND FIX IT. QUIT IGNORING THE MOBILE COMUNITY. THE REASON YOU PEOPLE HAVE MONEY AT ALL IS US! RETURN THE FAVOUR, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥S!!! GOD.
9098	0	a	wtf is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9099	0	a	Just so this game doesn't get the positive tag.  It should though.
9100	0	a	THE WROST EVER MAND I HATE IT I WOT THS GAME RMD FUM THE STORE
9101	0	a	Only for kids.
9102	0	a	I like the Game alot, It's fun, addictive, and brings out the creative side of you! But a HUGE problem is all the random Problems!! For instance, I launched the game yesterday And it was fine, I launhed it today and it says 'failed to Start game (unknown Problem) And I did not update it, and It had no update's that could be downloaded!!! So if you want to get it, be aware. ever 2-5 months your game will not launch and say Failed to start, and you will need to go through A huge, long annoying, reseting process!!!!!!!!!!
9103	0	a	my world was 'unknown' and the game deleted my world :( spent 200 hours on it :(
9104	0	a	It sucks.
9105	0	a	Minecraft in 2D is not very fun or engaging.

9107	0	a	amazingly good game but in the new update i cant play it, apparenty no soutible graphics card found  goddam computer :steamfacepalm:
9108	0	a	UPDATE - From the perspective of someone who HAS played Starbound:  Without getting into the drama between the two games, a number of features in Starbound feel more polished and thought out than similar ones in Terraria, even basic things like block behavior and mining. Fundamentally, they're very similar games, but if I were unaware and had to guess which was the game that sat in Early Access forever, I would assume it was Terraria, since it just feels more unfinished and unrefined - see my original review.  I'm changing my review from a recommend to a do not recommend in light of having played Starbound, but that doesn't mean I feel any differently about Terraria in general. It's still a good game, I just would recommend you buy Starbound instead.  ORIGINAL REVIEW - From the perspective of someone who has NOT played Starbound:  Terraria is an interesting take on a sandbox game. It looks like Minecraft in 2D, and in some ways it is, though there's a bit of a WoW or traditional open world game flavor in there too in how its quests work. It has the same mechanics that many people find addictive in games of this sort - the freedom to create and build a world of your choosing. You get exactly what it says on the carton, in that sense.  My major issues with the game revolve around its scope and plot structure. The scope of Terraria is clearly restricted. Though you have a great deal of freedom in what to do in the game, you don't have terribly much freedom in how to do things. The heirarchy of resources and crafting stations is quite rigid, and the number of different environments and worthwhile endeavours is not as large as it may first appear. You start a new game, you chop down some trees, you mine some stone, you build a worktable and a house and put the guide in it, and the rest of the game flows about the same. Once you've seen one underground marble cave, you've seen them all.  This wouldn't really be all that much of a problem - tons of sandbox games excel with a fairly rigid set of rules, look at Factorio and all the people squeeing about that - except that Terraria's content is welded to its shockingly linear plot structure. To get wires, you have to find the mechanic character. To find her, you have to enter the dungeon. To enter the dungeon, you have to fight this boss. To fight this boss, you need a significant health upgrade. To get the health upgrade, you need to spelunk in caves for hours. But once you get a few, this other boss appears, and it'll really save time if you build more houses and get these other characters to live in them, and geez is this a sandbox game or an RPG? I just wanted some freaking wires!  The entire game's set up that way. As another example, a huge amount of content and equipment is walled off in something called 'hardmode', which requires you to travel to the bottom of the map (read: hours of exploring caves and mining and placing platforms, ropes, minecart tracks, etc.) and fight a very difficult boss. Until you do this, you can't access a ton of different tools, types of blocks, and entire gameplay mechanics. For someone who already has a strong character, this is fairly easy to do on a new map. For someone wanting to play an RPG with an exploration/crawler focus and minimal crafting elements, this is probably pretty fun. For someone just wanting to build some cool things with teleporters (or other similar sandbox game motivations), it's a huge pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ and a bit of a turn-off.  So, I'm recommending the game because it's polished, well-designed, and pretty fun. But, you should know what you're getting yourself into. Terraria masquerades as a sandbox game, but if you try to play it like one, you'll get frustrated.
9109	0	a	The basis of the game is unoriginal and is repetetive. I play this game and it just gets boring too quickly.
9110	0	a	I know everyone that is about to read this is gonna hate me, but I HATE THIS GAME. What is this? A bad acid trip or something? It's full of a bunch of complete nonsense. For example, there's a weapon called the 'Electrosphere Launcher' which shoots bolds of electricity. Sounds like this game would take place in the future or something, right? But then there's pirates!? What the hell would they be doing in a futuristic setting? There's also zombies, vampires, a giant queen bee, and slime monsters, which were in Legend of Zelda first! It's an acid trip, I'm telling you. And then there's a Mothra knock-off called 'Mothron'. REALLY??? I HOPE TOHO SUES YOU, RE-LOGIC! So they ripped off both slimes from Legend of Zelda AND Mothra. However, Re-Logic did make Super Mario Bros. X, a game I really love. So I don't completely hate them, but God do I hate Terraria. If you like nonsense, go ahead and buy this game. I rate this game 1/10.
9111	0	a	I see you wandered off the wrong side of the review section. Don't worry it happens. Now go buy this monument of a game before and stop fooling around.
9112	0	a	Terraria is unfortunately ANOTHER overrated indie game. In such a short amount of time it managed to garner a huge fanbase of autistic nerds who can't wait to build stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that nobody cares about. It's clearly a rip-off of Minecraft but they've gypped you out of one whole dimension. Someone call Super Nintendo, it looks like their graphics have been stolen! Look if I wanted a Super Nintendo I'd head down to Good Will and buy one for $5. Stricken by poor level design and hardly any platforming challenges, it's hard to tell what the devs were going for with this garbage game. It's no wonder that one of the lead-developers is a pretentious, emotional autistic nerd, who is well known for his deviantART poetry, 'The Art of Touching a Woman.' He also looks like Andy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Anyways, Terraria or Minecraft 2: Electric Boogaloo is cookie cuter, uninspired, and overall extremely terrible.
9113	0	a	Why you looking at negative reviews? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

9118	0	a	I got bored of this game over time. Because once you beat it, there is nothing to do. And it is VERY SLOW to start a new character. But in the beginning it is ok.
9119	0	a	not as good as minecraft, 2d fokin rip-off
9120	0	a	If you're first starting out, this game is terrible. There's no directions or help.

9124	0	a	Gets boring quick good for children i guess....                   And for pro gamers                 Just kidding                  im really bored             Help ;_:                                INHALE THE MEMES EXHALE THE MEMES INJECT THE MEMES INTO MY BLOOD STREAM                                           WHY HAS GOD LEFT US
9125	0	a	Now, normally people would look at this game and scream out 'Oh wow, they totally copiede Mojang and made Minecraft 2D!' Granted, the two are very similar, but personally I believe Terraria is a little more story driven, especially with the new 1.3 update. I really love this game, but there's just one thing that bugs me about it.  I HATE REPEATEDLY GRINDING FOR MATERIALS  I'm what you would call a 'Pixel-Artist', and I love making big huge 2D pixelated masterpieces. And it was really hard to do it in Minecraft because it has a very limited color pallate. Terraria, however, has a huge range of every color in the rainbow and then some. But to get a lot of those beautiful blocks, you have to do some absurd gathering just for one little piece! And have I mentioned that TERRARIA HAS NO BUILT-IN CREATIVE MODE?!  I really want to be able to expand my gallery of pixels, but it's hard to do it with Terraria because of this stupid lack of freedom.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, Re-Logic, give Terraria a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Creative mode
9126	0	a	Pros:  -Good Graphics -A lot of items -Cloud-saving -Cheaper than Minecraft -Better than Minecraft -Easy to customize your character -More weapons than Minecraft -Wires -Walls -Wings -PORTAL GUN :D  Cons: -You're looking at the negative section. -You haven't bought the game yet. -You're still choosing between Minecraft and Terraria  My tip: Buy Terraria   Have fun :&gt;
9127	0	a	Ok, seriously, what's with the deleted progress. I haven't played Terraria for a while and I came back since I wanted to play on a server. And then when I loaded up my characters... All gone. Not even my worlds are here too. I don't know why this happens. Probably because of a bug or something. I really want the devs to fix this, it's really annoying.
9128	0	a	played a tiny bit, its pretty good
9129	0	a	at first it works the second time you play POOF It makes a disk write error
9130	0	a	Too pixelated
9131	0	a	Terraria was one of the best games I've ever played, but after they released 1.2, I stopped enjoying it! Luckily through the use of (I don't know how) I have a working 1.1 cliet, I still wish RELogic would release the ability to download the old versions with 1.4...
9132	0	a	It can be fun sometimes, but when u playing just by ur self, its really boring... ^-^ so 1-10, 4.9
9133	0	a	If I haven't watched a ton of Terraria videos I would call this a Minecraft's clone. Probably a lot of people think that way. All I saw was from videos and they were awesome. Boss run, epic structures, amazing weaponry, the list goes on. But then you might wonder why I dislike this game. The thing is, it is very limited at the very beginning. All that great loot is random, and there is so many of it that newbies such as me get too confused. I'd love to play this game, but the beginning scares me away because every time I get killed by some random monsters and all I had was some horrible wooden armor and sword. I can't recommend a game that doesn't let me try it's full potential. Buy it, but only if you have a pro friend who could teach you how to play.
9134	0	a	Well, here i am writing my review for this newly terrible game. Since 1.3.1 the updates are just going downhill and making the game more boring and repetitive. Since 1.3.1 i haven't played Terraria AT ALL and this is because it's just got worse. In my opinion they should have left the game at 1.3 and just update purely for bug fixes.
9135	0	a	new opion - dislike the art style dislike the gameplay if you can call it gameplay soundtrack is anoying cant be bothered to right anything else old opinion - This game is very fun I find it is hard to restart because you feel under powered. Can get tedious when farming for certain items but still love this game get this and love it if your not a fan of 2d game I would not recommend this as the game to start with
9136	0	a	honestly one of my favorite games ever till now, my 40 hour playthrough with tons of work just got corupted and theres literally no way to fix it.. this is the third time this has happend, it happend twice in 1.1 and i thought it would be fixed but nah
9137	0	a	Nah just kiddin, its the greatest game ever!!! Even other negative reviews agree with me! No, seriously, go check it out if you dont believe me. Hands down the greatest RPG game I've ever played!

9139	0	a	Game can't run anymore Which is crazy because they didn't even update the specs in the steam page It's one thing to ruin the optimization It's another to lie to those looking to buy your game  Keep in mind this isn't a small drop in fps I went from running a constant 60 and having no issues once so ever on the highest settings To having low 20s-30s at best on lowest graphics It's basically unplayable now
9140	0	a	The game wont open for me. I love Terraria so i bought it on christmas and i played it once. I tried to play it again but it just wont open.

9144	0	a	I installed Steam on all of my children's computers as I was informed that the games on the platform would prove more reliable than having a disk. What an utter bloody mistake.  Having spent a week trying to install it, but consistantly coming up with an Error code, I tried to use the support but had to find a log on, tried to ask for advice on Facebook, received no guidance, looked on the help forums, and Googled as many ideas as I could to try and understand why it would not upload on my sons computer (note: it was installed, and then decided one morning simply not to work).  Thinking it must be a problem with the computer, I took the laptop into the computer shop, and had them completely clean out and reinstall my sons computer at a cost of $150, only to discover on getting it home that guess what..... IT STILL WON'T REINSTALL. To say I'm hacked off is an understatement. I pay for games, I expect my kids to be able to play them.  I am not interested in getting a Steam Support log in, I simply want them to be able to play the game I paid for? Is that at all possible? I'd appreciate some support from someone sometime soon, as now, out of pocket, I've actually had enough.

9146	0	a	This was my favorite game- until.... I LOST TWO MAPS WITH GREAT ITEMS IN THE CRATES!  -_- I tried to restore them on my laptop which runs on windows, but to no avail. First one- I had a house in the sky and everyone had a home, 9 heart crystals, 15 mana were in a crate box. I was already at full health so I had extra. That one crashed. Then I started going to my other map, where I had a special home designed like a japaneese garden. :/ And then it crashed today- no clue why. But I worked hard on it, really hard- and for some odd reason- I got kicked out of the game- when I tried to restore a back up file and it would not work. :'( And now the world's backup file is gone. I'm sure it's windows doing this- but I would love for this game to not fight with Windows for effing sake!  I love this game, but have to change my review due to this experience. I'm beyond frustrated now. I've been working my â™¥â™¥â™¥ off this whole week so I can fight bosses. Now- I'm back at flipping square one, except what's left on my character. :(

9151	0	a	I can't even play it. Waste of time and money
9152	0	a	Edit: Can no longer recommend this game, its broken in so many ways. Death from random heights, no matter how close you are to the ground, you can die from a 2 block drop. Health Potions are taking 5 to 10 minutes between uses, yet every wiki or set of information states it should not be doing this. Developers have failed to respond to inquiries and support tickets submitted to them.
9153	0	a	The game is really cute, but as far as I'm concerned that's the only thing it's got going for it. Pros: + Cute, nice looking art style. + Straight forward easy to understand gameplay  Cons: - Awkward, stiff and clunky controls which add frustration and more difficulty than there should be. - Only supports use of one gamepad at a time, meaning that in co-op someone has to use the keyboard which controls are even worse. - Local co-op only. - Unforgiving gameplay (could be a positive, depending on your opinion)  Tl;Dr: Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a cute game with really awkward and broken controls, which on sale might be worth buying but I would recommend spending your hard earned money on something else.  Thanks for reading my review, have a great day!
9154	0	a	Don't want to read much: Pro: + Platformer + Looks nice + Cheap (when on sale)  Con: - Bad Controls (imprecise) - Button colors/labels ingame do not match with xbox controller (the one tobe seems to hold) - Flow interrupting 'cutscene' in every level - No two controller coop, just controller/keyboard (title supports only local coop) - Tiny resolution - Unable to exit the game with the controller   I usually enjoy platformer, especially short and independet ones with great music.  I don't really care for the graphics, although I have to say Tobe's looked pretty appealing to me on the screenshots.  However nice graphics cannot make up for broken control mechanics, which are in my opinion the most important part of any platformer.
9155	0	a	Tobe's Vertical Adventure is one of those games that makes me long for a ~Meh~ option for steam reviews.   Right, right, so what've we got here? Well, Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a Side-Scrolling... Er, Up-n'-Down-Scrolling(?) platformer where the idea is to get from the top of a cave to the bottom and then make your escape back to the entrance, all while collecting gems and animals as you descend/ascend. It offers two different playable characters for singleplayer and multiplayer story modes across four different worlds, each with four levels. So lets get started shall we?   First of all I'd like to mention the presentation. The majority of the game is represented in the form of sprites, with some art slides that are used as cutscenes and such. The style of the art is nice; it's a simplistic style where everything is gratuitously round for some reason or another. I'm being told it's cute, but something about the hips of both characters being twice the size of their heads puts me off... Anyway, it works, but it's nothing I can say is spectacular. The in-game sprites also look okay and have decent animation to them, but I noticed that a fair few of them were blurry or lacked sharpness, specifically the character sprites. Overall, it's a quaint artstyle, but it's nothing to write home about.   Audio is also just okay. Not a lot of music to listen to; There's the menu music, one track for each world, and then some cutscene music. Once again, none of it is /really/ good, just kinda okay. I suppose I liked the 1st and 3rd world's music the best, seeing as I remember them the most, but it's still all... Whatever y'know? Sound effects as well, which really wouldn't even be noted in this review if it wasn't for the fact that many sound effects occuring at the same time will cause the sound to increase in volume exponentially. Collecting gems becomes a little less fun when you start hearing 'ding, Ding, DING, DDDIIIINNNGGG' as you pick them up in groups.   Put hey, as long as the gameplay if fun, right?... Er, well, it's okay. That's the word of the day folks. As previously mentioned, you start at the top of the level and must make your way down to a chest at the bottom. You'll encounter stage-specific traps and collect power-ups such as balloons and ropes... Which is to say those are the only items you collect. Balloons allow you to float down for a short period of time and ropes can be thrown to the ceiling where they'll hang down and you can climb them. In all honesty though, I never really /needed/ these items. Aside from using balloons to break my fall simply so I could go down a vertical shaft a little more quickly for my own convenience, everything can be done almost, if not just as easily without these items. They /can/ occasionally be used to make speedruns easier, but speedrunning, while encouraged, is not the main focus of the game.   The worlds don't have a whole lot of diference in them either. The first one is just a cave; there are some enemies that walk back and forth, nothing really special. The second world is an ice world that introduces horizontally positioned ropes, and has invisible blocks as one of it's level gimmicks. There's also a trap that's, like, an impossible-to-see fake wall that'll drop on you from the background, but it only appears twice and it's where you'll be running so fast that you'll pass them without a second thought. Third world is the lava world, so there's lava and stuff. This world has these bubbles that'll pop and bounce you up when you land on them, which make the platforming a little more interesting. Thing is, these bubbles reform waaayy too fast, so you'll encounter vertical shafts with unavoidable bubbles in them so that you can quickly ascend, but on the way down will only bounce you up and reform before you fall beyond them. Lastly there's the pyramid island. There's some shooty traps, there are some annoying spike traps, and some crushers. Nothing entirely notable really.   What IS kinda cool about this game is the escape bit of the levels. Once you get to the bottom, you have to unlock a chest which causes the cave to crumble while you make your escape. You have a limited amount of time, which can be extended by 10 or 15 seconds depending on how well you do on the chest unlocking QTE. At this point in time, the level changes, destroying certain walls and platforms to allow for certain shortcuts and various hazards. It can also make getting the collectibles easier, but you also have a time limit, so you kinda have a risk/reward thing goin' on there. You can even see what blocks will be destroyed when the cave crumbles, so you can semi-plan your escape route on your way down!   Finally, lets talk about the characters. There's not a whole lot to say about them; both can grab ledges, wall-jump, and roll. Tobe, the yellow one, is faster and can do a short wall-run. The controls for the wall-run are fairly clunky and imprecise though, so I'd always screw it up at vital points in time. Nana, the pink one, on the other hand is slower, has less health, but has a double jump. This double jump allows her to make ascend quickly, break a long fall, take short cuts, and basically wall-climb. She is by far the easier character of the two, as reflected by the stricter speedrun times in the achievement sections. The game was short enough as it is, but even after clearing the game 100%, Nana got me through it in a little under a half hour.    And that's kinda the whole problem with the game. It's pretty short, and what little there is of it has a lack of substance. Playing through the game as both characters was probably an hour's work, and that's with doing the previously mentioned 100% completion. And that's not even mentioning the various glitches I've come across, including but not limited to being clipped inside of a wall consistantly after being hit on a particular level, or stuttering scrolling during co-op play. Match that with head-scratching desgin choices like unnoticable but sparsley placed wall traps, or quickly respawning bubbles, and this game is a short, unpolished, substance-lacking 'meh' of a game.   The one place where this game shines to it's fullest though is it's co-op, which is still flawed in a way thanks to the lack of duo-controller support and the fact that it's local-only. Still, in co-op, there are some extra moves you can pull off such as head bouncing or pulling the other player up a ledge, which made for some interesting multiplayer-specific shortcuts. Two players also collect gems and animals more quickly and efficiently, making the experience a touch more streamlined. Good luck finding someone who'll play it with you though, even if it would only be a half-hour.   But hey, that's all just my opinion. Cross reference mine with others and determine if this is a game for you. Though personally, there's juuuust enough wrong with the game to lean it towards the negative side of meh, and I really wouldn't pick it up unless it was on sale or something.
9156	0	a	This is probably on the very tame side of negative, but negative it is nonetheless.  My main problem with this game comes down to the controls; they're very stiff and clunky and even 100%'ing the game I'm still not quite sure how everything works. Wall jumping in particular is a pain but really there's just a lot of weirdness here.  The neat thing about this game is the way levels start you off going down, then hurry you back upwards with more paths unlocked. It's actually generally pretty clever level design and only a few levels really spoil this by forcing you to wait for an obstacle to be out of the way.  That being said it's also fairly glitchy and clipping through walls/platforms is not an uncommon occurence. Not a huge hindrance but it's there.  The music and graphics are fairly standard 16-bit type stuff, nothing really special.  The control scheme is also quite awkward and if I ever thought directly about which button to press I'd always end up pressing the wrong one. It's just strange.  This probably isn't a 'bad' game but it's not one I particularly enjoyed, it's a very 'meh' game more than anything. It's also really short, 16 levels that can be completed in a few minutes each. Probably not really worth it for the price, that's also a part of my rating here. Honestly it's possible to have some fun with this game but it's not a high-quality experience even still.
9157	0	a	 Tobe's Vertical Adventure  is a retro platformer built around modern ideas. As the titular Tobe and his would-be girlfriend Nana, you embark on a quest to loot every island you come across and making off with as much gold as you can carry. A simple plot for a simple game, it sets up Tobe's most interesting feature.  Each level is structured like that of a cave, starting you off at the top and forcing you to make your way down to the treasure somewhere at the bottom. When you finally get your prize, the cave begins to collapse opening new paths and sending you scrambling for the surface before time runs out and you are trapped under the rubble. It's a cool mechanic that I haven't seen other games do, and works well given the somewhat nonlinear level design that lets you choose from several different paths going both downwards and upwards. Being able to run off one side of the screen and pop out the other also allows for more creative traversal, which is the game's strongest asset.  But aside from this much of the game is rather clumsy, especially in terms of controls and movement. Essentially you move as a mix of Sonic 2's underwater levels with the original Prince of Persia's acrobatic hijinks. Tobe can run up walls, slide under gaps, and dangle from hanging branches, whereas Nana swaps the wall climb for a double jump. This sounds great on paper would work fantastically with the open level designs, if only the characters controlled with any consistency. Button presses register only part of the time, your jump is terribly weak which makes scaling walls frustratingly unpredictable, and movement as a whole feels like Sonic plodding through a muddy swamp.   The second problem is the game is alarmingly short. I completed all 16 levels in just over an hour, which for the price feels quite insufficient. Theoretically you could double this time if you plan to play through with both characters, but they play so similarly I don't believe it to be worth doing so.  All the while I was playing I couldn't help but think how much  Tobe's Vertical Adventure  feels like a flash game awkwardly dressed up as a full game and put up on Steam as if players wouldn't notice. If it wasn't for the terrible controls I could still recommend it at sale prices, but unfortunately they ruined my enjoyment of the game and I wouldn't feel right advising others to purchase it. I'm quite disappointed to have to say it too because the level designs, art and music are not half bad, but a platformer with bad controls is like a sandwich without bread. It just doesn't work.

The technology seems limited, I didnâ€™t like the controls, and the scrambling animation half through a level takes way too long for my taste. The story is really basic and put on top.  If you like pixel platformers, it still may be for you.
9159	0	a	Game doesn't work for me - crashes on load with a 'Some issue with Steam API. Highscores downloaded: True' error followed by a fatal exception window. Messing with settings didn't seem to do anything, and there's no other reports of this error for this old game.  So yeah, not a 'real' review, but also not recommended since it doesn't function.
9160	0	a	Shoddily coded platformer that's not particularly amazing. If you have a copy, here are some tips:  - Play as Nana if you're not co-op, double-jump is great. - The game does not save your settings. Period. So god help you if you want it windowed/lower volume/custom keys, you're changing it every time. - If you play windowed/alt-tab away, the game will continue tracking your key inputs when it's not in focus! Have fun responding to an IM and then it quits the game on you. - 4-3 is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up stage. Worst level in the game.  I'm platformer-friendly but damn this thing is repetitive without any real positives.
9161	0	a	Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a mix of classic platformers and new platformers but will you want to sit through this game ? In Tobe's Vertical Adventure you play as Tobe his Girlfriends Nana brings him on an adventure to find a treasure. So how is this game ? Now i wish to give this a good Review but im not gonna do that. First of all the game is quite charming and at first glance fun but after playing it for a while you start noticing the flaws. First the good. The game is quite fun to play and it looks beutifull but after that its all bad. Glitches are all over the place and it makes the game an even bigger challenge. The game has unresponsive and broken controlls. The game is incredibly short clocking in at around one hour long. Overall the game is pretty broken mess thats not worth your money or youre time only get it on a sale when it goes 90% off or a bundle with other games other wise dont bother. Tobe's Vertical Adventure gets a 5/10
9162	0	a	Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a cute-as-a-button adventure platformer. The game has a few technical shortcomings that, at least for me, hamper my enjoyment.  The Good:    The game's art style is retro. Nice SNES would probably describe it pretty well.    The game has nice music. It's not mind-blowing but it fits the games visual theme and genre.    The gameplay extends beyond simple adventure platforming through the use of consumable tools/items (like ceiling ropes, balloons, etc.)   The Bad:    The controls. A platformer lives and dies with its controls, and moving around in the world is painful. Taking turning around whil running for instance, it's a seemingly-forever animation that heavily penalizes for running in anything but a straight line in the game. Precision jumping feels a bit trickier than need be, but maybe that's just me.    The frame rate. It suffers from an XNA bug (thanks Microsoft!) that locks the game at a lower framerate than what it's supposed to run at. Rather than just looking choppy, this framerate affects the controls as well so the game feels sluggish. See the forums for a post about this where someone links to articles written by other devs who've had to fix the bug in their games.    Limited video settings including no resolution adjustment. This isn't a horrible aspect since the game has a decidedly retro look anyhow, but I couldn't find much in the way of graphical settings of any kind. Given that it's made with XNA, my guess is this was because it was intended to (or did?) live on a Microsoft console at some point.   I suspect if the developer ever came back to this game to give it some love, this could be a really fun game. However, its technical shortcomings right now leave it in a state that are mildly frustrating and certainly not worth anyone's time given the quantity and quality of other platformers on the PC.
9163	0	a	I really tried to like this game but the controls are just horrible. Everything about controlling Tobe feels clunky and awkward which makes traversing each level frustrating rather than fun. Considering that the latter half of every level is against the clock such imprecise controls just result in an unpleasent and unsatisfying gaming experience.  Navigating the confusing menus and UI is equally frustrating and, even though you can redefine the game controls, you still have to use the hard-coded defaults to operate the UI. This means that even when dismissing in-game dialogs while you are playing (i.e. when you read a sign) you still have to use the J and K keys.  While the art is quite cute and Cave Story-esque I can't see much else to recommend here.
9164	0	a	Just another wonky controlled, delayed response, buggy platformer with standard enemies and bad collisions unfortunately. Nothing much else to say.
9165	0	a	Controls are very unresponsive for a platformer. I gave up after the pressing up didn't grab a rope for the 20th time.
9166	0	a	This game suffers from some clunky controls, even after you remap the keyboard to have less â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ keys (which by the way, also requires a lot of effort to do). The levels are short and in each one you decend to some treasure before re-climbing in a timed escape. When you are under pressure to get out quickly, falling to your death because of un-responsive controls is not fun.  This game isn't without its up-sides, but it usally just ends up you longing to play a different, better game, live Noitu Love 2. Better controls, better music, a choice of 3 distinct characters instead of 2 basically-the-same-but-one-is-worse characters. This recommendation is actually a recommendation for Noitu Love 2. Go buy that game, and screw this one.  2/5
9167	0	a	The design is cute, and the game seems like it'd be fun, but it is crippled by the fact that the control scheme was clearly made in mind for people with a superflous third arm- and by proxy, a third hand.
9168	0	a	Not sure how i managed buying this?
9169	0	a	I DON'T LIKE IT
9170	0	a	this kid runs like naruto and it's the clunkiest platformer i've ever had the distaste of playing 2/10
9171	0	a	.
9172	0	a	I do not know what people see in this game. Off the bat it is to cluncky and wierd. Also the game is a platformer with no controller support? Really?  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ programming with mainstream gaming makes this a game I can't recommend.  Also the changes in gravity and friction for no reason just makes it hard to play. Stay away from this game if you know what is best for you.
9173	0	a	It's... meh. It's not bad, but you really get the feeling that there's no actual point to playing it.  Oh, and I hate the controls. So much.
9174	0	a	Because Tobe's Horizontal Adventure would be politically incorrect.
9175	0	a	How good or bad is this game? I dunno, I haven't gotten very far, because the controls are godawful...  Do with that what you will.
9176	0	a	Could have been a good platformer with its own personality, but it's kinda buggy, which makes it not optimal enough to be what it wanted to be.
9177	0	a	Doesn't work under Windows 10/with 4K resolutions.   Selling games that are not supported for forward platforms on Steam is misleading and deceptive business practices.   Don't buy this - it doesn't work and the developers don't maintain it.   If it's not removed from Steam soon, it's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
9178	0	a	weird/awkward controls, couldn't get take it
9179	0	a	The controls are terrible and unresponsive.
9180	0	a	Meh.. Too boring and i consider a a waste of money. This game may be a little similar to games like Super Mario but is more boring. Also the countdown on each level and the controls are awful.  ~ 2/10
9181	0	a	This game is trrash
9182	0	a	Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a pretty generic platformer. You go down into caves to get some stuff, and then you have to get up again quickly, on a timer. There isn't a lot to make the game stand out from other platformers.
9183	0	a	cool
9184	0	a	4/10.   Welcome to Tobe's Vertical Adventure, a platforming game without good platforming. There is basically no story. Controls are given in non-gamepad instructions when your gamepad is plugged in. There are 4 worlds, but they have the EXACT same look and layout just with the color of the blocks changed. You can jump, roll, and have 2 abilities. Jumping is terrible, it is super slow and floaty. You will wall jump and barely move out to the side. Half the time when you jump you think you can make it but your guy never will. Some of the worst actual platforming I have seen in a platformer. The rolling is inconsistent because you have to be holding sprint, moving to the side, and then press down, but it doesn't work half the time. You cannot use direcitonal pad, as only analogs work for some reason. Every level you go to the bottom and then just run back up to the top. There is a little bit of destruction but its basically just the same thing.   The poor level design and the time limit on getting to the top make it so if you die you have to restart, and if you accidentally press the wrong button because they aren't labeled correctly on the pause menu, you have to restart the level.Both of the abilities are finnicky and poorly done. The rope doesn't shoot up above you and you can never tell where it will go exactly. The balloons if you let of them you drop, as opposed to toggling, which makes more sense.   All in all the lack of proper player control, the poor platforming, and the reused uninteresting level design and repetitiveness just screen free flash game, but they charged 5 dollars for it. Avoid.
9185	0	a	Really good game
9186	0	a	I honestly wished that I could give this more time than I did, but the controls for this game are so terrible that I could not play through it. The jumps feel awkward and clunky, which is a huge problem if you are trying to make a platformer game, as it is your primary mechanic. The run just felt way too slow and the run jump was never a further jump than the regular jump. When you are trying to make a platformer, you need to get your controls down first. A plaformer can have the best level designs ever, but nobody will enjoy playing the game if the controls are unplayable.
9187	0	a	I got this as a premium key on â™¥â™¥â™¥,at first the game looked promising as there was a 2 player coop mode,but what I found playing was terribly unbalanced characters that tried to make the game more dynamic but instead made the game much more stressful when one of the players can get to a certain area and the other cannot.Single player was kinda fun but it didnt really fit my taste.
9188	0	a	I cannot play this game its not working I can hear the sound but I cannot start the game up .I have tried everything there is No playing this game jet it says I have been playing the game but it was just the sound in the back ground .
9189	0	a	I don't recommend this game
9190	0	a	Aliens vs. Predator is a reboot of the extremely successful Aliens vs. Predator PC-game franchise, whose only 2 releases were in 1999 and 2001. The 2010 release is made by the same team as the originals and features much of the same gameplay and features. I played through the Predator campaign and tried some of the Alien and Marine levels for my first impressions.    The Good:    * This game features three separate campaigns, each with completely different control schemes and game mechanics. Although they are all FPS-action, the similarities between the three campaigns sort of end there. The Marine campaign plays a lot like a horror FPS game, you are stuck in dark hallways with a flashlight and loads of weaponry. The predator game is a bit more stealth &amp; platform-based: the predator campaign gives you control of a character with super jumping power, the ability to go semi-invisible, and the ability to perform stealth takedowns. Finally, the alien campaign allows your character to walk on walls and ceilings, run extremely quickly, and also regenerate health over time. The alien campaign also features stealth elements but has a remarkably different feel from any other FPS game due to your avatar's low viewing position and extremely fast speed.  * The jumping mechanics for the predator are excellent: fun and intuitive. The game is fair in its level design regarding the implementation of a playable character that has super-human jumping abilities.  * The game's plot is interwoven across all 3 campaigns. You can experience the same story from 3 different perspectives.  * Great 'kill' animations, but there are too few of them.     The Bad:    * Field-of-view is locked at around 70 degrees or so. Not the worst, but annoying.  * Inconsistent graphical quality. Some things look amazing, other times I felt like I was playing a Half-Life mod.  * The predator gameplay, which I was most looking forward to, is lackluster. The stealth technology hardly seems to work on the Marines, and it does not work at all vs. Aliens.  * Melee combat never really does well in FPS games, and 2/3rds of this game is melee combat. The developers needed some sort of gimmick or game mechanic to make the combat interesting, rather than just repeatedly mashing down the LMB.   * The auto-save checkpoints don't work if you're trying to play all three campaigns at the same time. For example, your savegame in the predator campaign will get overwritten if you try to go play the marine campaign. This problem can be fixed by manually saving your game, or restarting levels from the very beginning.     The Ugly:    * The single-player game is essentially three long hallways with objectives clearly pointed out for the player with plenty of hand-holding. I am getting sick of games like that.  * The wall-climbing aspect of the alien is unintuitive and seems to only work half the time. Rather than giving me a button to click to go on a wall, my character should just automatically start climbing it. But that is not the worst part: the game puts in things like computer banks and bookcases against walls to purposefully restrict you from using certain walls. It is incredibly annoying that a super powerful alien can decimate an entire spaceship of marines but cannot climb on walls that happen to have computer banks at the bottom of them.  * Multiplayer, which is supposed to be a large chunk of the game's playability, is completely dead.    The Verdict:    Although Aliens vs. Predator is a solid FPS with some innovative game mechanics, it does little to enhance gaming as a whole. The game will not be remembered five years from now and will most likely never make it onto anyone's top 10 list for anything. But the game is a fun diversion worth checking out if you can find the game on a deep sale. However, I don't think you will make it through any of the campgaigns before getting bored so I cannot recommend it.
9191	0	a	Not terrible if you're a fan of either franchise, but ultimately shallow and easy to lose interest in.
9192	0	a	Wheres the multiplayer? I sit waiting, never finding anyone.
9193	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ can't even use ingame cursor
9194	0	a	I really want to give this game a thumbs up, but I can't. The game is great, probably one of the best on my account it's just that the multiplayer is dead and no one is playing it, so I can't recommend a game that doesn't have more to offer than 6 hours.
9195	0	a	I used to love this game very much. This game made me to meet Steam (Steam isn't too popular in my country) BUT Long time no updates Hackers filled the servers Too many of glitches and bugs Multiplayer dieing It was awesome... but however...it's dieing now. This is a loss. I like this game and really want to recommend it, however, i can't recommend it these days. I am a fan of AvP franchise and this game was my favourite for a long time. I played the campaign over and over, reached highest level in multiplayer and mastered co-op survival mode. And i'm not a high graphics maniac. But the game is not taking any support, so it is hard to recommend it. No anti-hack, no bugfixes... just have a look at RWS; they're updating POSTAL2 since released. But AvP? Not updated for more than 2 years...
9196	0	a	Is there not ONE Aliens game worth a damn out of them all? Heard this was pretty good, reviews say pretty good, IMO not very good. This game goes out of it's way to punish players even on Easy, for it's time the graphics were amazing but the playability really does a critical hit to the games fun factor, also on a sidenote the game can never decide how many shots it will take to kill any random target, sometimes it takes one headshot from a pistol, the same enemy might take 3 shotgun blasts to the face to kill 2 mins later, this might be good if they can patch it for balance but if you got this for a solo campaign like I did just save your $ this thing needs a lot of help I am pretty sure it will never get.  Story 1.0 Wasn't worth playing after 80min of the Marine campaign.  Graphics 8.0 For it's day these were epic graphics, and even today better than some.  Playability : 1.0 Not sure who did the balancing but they should be fired and never allowed in the gaming industry ever again, Marine runs like he has a load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in his pants with forgettable random damage weapons that fluxuates wildly from alien to alien.  Was hoping for a gem came up with another failed attempt at a movie license game. 2.0 / 10
9197	0	a	The single player is boring. It does not have any variety or adds anything new to make it interesting. All Campaigns share the same story which while interesting story mode is very slow paced and mostly filler to make the game seem longer.  Multiplayer is hard to find matches, and when you do you get lots of hackers cheating and even so the Predators are the most strongest species, while Aliens and Marines are struggles trying to fight against any Predator player. Marines are also way too slow and have hardly any health and all characters constantly lose their balance when melee, making it very hard to get back up or have a fighting chance. SEGA does not update or even fixes any of the game's issues. And the game lags horribly, and almost unplayable due to how much lag the servers have. Steam also does nothing to get rid of cheaters so this gets a bad score and not reccomended.   IF THIS IS ON SALE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IF IT IS AT $3 DO NOT. EVEN IF THE GAME IS GIVEN AS A GIFT OR IS FREE STAY AWAY FROM IT! UNLESS STEAM OR SEGA WANT TO FIX THE GAME'S PROBLEMS THEN MAYBE THE GAME IS WORTH A FEW CENTS.
9198	0	a	The campaign is way too short compared to its predeccesor Alien vs Predator 2. I finished the Alien campaign in less than 2 hours. I've finished the Alien campaign and will add more stuff when I finish the Predator and Human campaigns. This felt like a cheap way to mooch off the AvP franchise name without putting in any effort to create a game. 6 hours to finish 3 campaigns who reuse the same exact maps is just too fast.  Bought it on the Steam Sale for $7.50.  PROS 1. Interesting Franchise I mean it's AvP. There are a lot of interesting weapons and technology in the lore.  CONS 1. Short Campaign Way too short.  2. Uninteresting Campaign The campaign is pretty uninteresting compared to AvP 2. In AvP 2, you actually start off as a Facehugger having to find your first victim, followed by being a Chestburster and feeding on dogs then finally ending off as a Xenomorph. This just starts off as the Alien doing repetitive actions.  Press E to do an overly complex action before you kill the creature.  3. Alien Movement Clunky to say the least. You have to keep holding down Mouse 3 in order to run around smoothly. The view is also limited as you can't turn 360 to see your surroundings when you're hiding on top.  4. View No more Alien pheromone view. It's just normal mode with enemies highlighted Red, Blue and Yellow. You kill Red and Blues and harvest Yellows and they have to be in your line of sight.  5. Enemies â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor variety. Only a machine gunner and a flame thrower for human varieties. Predators were seriously weak, a jump attack and a heavy attack, rinse repeat.  6. Human Weapons A Rifle with a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a pistol and a smart gun. Where's the rocket launcher, plasma rifle, rail gun and your hand grenade?  7. Predator Weapons What happened to the Crossbow to rip heads off?  Why is the spinning disc so weak? It's like a toy ball. Where is the multi-targetting system in infra-red? How did the Predator staff become so strong and teleport back into your hands after each attack?
9199	0	a	i did not enjoy this game i beat the whole thing in less than a day it is not worth the money it costs i played the original and despite the bad graphics the origanl was more fun and had more of a story line as this one the chaters were very simple and not well put together they also all add up at certain points meaning the enviroment for each character is the same just in diferent orders if i were you id simply buy the older version than waste money on this failure of a remake
9200	0	a	Refunded. Absolutely awful compared to AvP2, very much my favourite multiplayer experience as a teenager: cheap weapons, pathetic melee system and awful maps.
9201	0	a	People now act like noobs and use the newbie weapons, get people killed when their trying to kill someone else. THIS GAME NOW SUCKS!!!!!
9202	0	a	AvP is the 3rd installement and the weakest of it's game series. Suffering from balancing in Multiplayer and a few other problems this one falls short. Purchase at your risk.
9203	0	a	Game doesn't work. only for a few seconds.
9204	0	a	Multiplayer is okay, as long as you dont 900v1 a marine (the 1 being the marine) with a shotgun. Single shot kill and fast firing guns is bad in multiplayer. And that sniper thing. Or as long as you dont fight a predator with weapons as an alien, you might stand a chance. Oh, and the single player campaings while entertaining, are as short as this review.

9206	0	a	I've played through this multiple times and I have finally come to a conclusion.   Artificial Intelligence  The marines are beyond stupid, they show no recognition of each others existence and they show no emotion when they discover that one of there comrades has mysteriously and violently died. The Alien AI is also pretty stupid, they run directly towards you or they run up a wall only to jump back down again.   Marine Campaign  The Marine campaign consists of walking around empty corridors and reaching marines moments after they die proving that the AI is so unbelievably stupid that the developers have to kill them all off using scripted events, there's no point going into detail about the Marine campaign because its really really generic. If you were looking for a Colonial Marines Squad experience you're out of luck because you spend the entire campaign on your own. Also a fellow Marine called Tequila talks into your ear for most of the game and she will annoy the hell out of you.   Alien Campaign  The Alien Campaign starts off quite promising but quickly goes downs hill when you meet the mentally challenged Marines who have no knowledge of each others existence, so you spend the entire campaign scuttling about killing off Marines one by one until the game tells you that you've won.   Predator Campaign  The Predator Campaign is really really boring, you simply jump about killing off mentally challenged Marines and having the occasional fight against a group of Aliens using disorientating melee attacks.   Multiplayer  The multiplayer is a tiny tiny tiny little bit better than the singleplayer but not something I would pay money for. The multiplayer maps are really small and most of them are recycled from the singleplayer. The multiplayer is almost dead and the currently being attacked by hackers.   Overall  I can't believe that people are calling this the best game ever because its awful compared to its predecessor Alien vs Predator 2. If you want a real AvP experience then go play Alien vs Predator 2 because its a fantastic game that has stood the test of time.  Still better than Aliens: Colonial Marines.
9207	0	a	Don't get this game, people wont stop glitching and hacking this game and the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing admins wont do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to ban them forever to keep this game clean. I think they should get the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and let true gamers be admins to ban â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who cheats.
9208	0	a	I bought this game (a second time, once on the 360 at release) because I figured I'd have fun with it again, and I meet the system requirements  'Graphics: DirectX 9.0c compliant video card with 128 MB RAM (NVIDIA 7900 or better, ATI X1800 or better) '  I have a Radeon 2600XT HD (256MB) graphics card, and on minimal settings (the settings are awful by the way) I get maybe 5fps.
9209	0	a	  i liked the aliens but felt it needed more predator presence. wasn't as good as the frst one, don't recommend. 1
9210	0	a	Just alot of hackers
9211	0	a	Way too short for the asking price. Not a bad game, just priced horribly. (Yes, i know i only have 1.6 hours played on steam. I bought this game when it came out on console and finished it in about 6 hours.)
9212	0	a	THis game is ok but not worth 60$ in my book. Aliens V.s. Predator 2 was the beat one. If they took out the 'E' finesher movies and remake the old maps this would been alot batter.
9213	0	a	Advertised as COOP has no COOP
9214	0	a	Was a huge fan of the original two games, made by the same company, and had high hopes for this before it was released. Unfortunately, this feels like an incomplete side-project with clunky controls and a depressingly simplified gaming world. Where are all the non-combatant humans for us to torment, like we had in the original games? Why is the Xenomorph mode so tiny?  I feel that the devs concentrated all their energy on making the game look good, side-lining things like cunning AI (instead we get really weird stuff happening).  Such a shame.
9215	0	a	IF YOU WANNA PLAY A GAME, WHERE YOU..... AND TWO OTHER PEOPLE. IN THE ENTIRE WORLD... THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU                       ps. this game has AMAZING graphics, and has great PVP
9216	0	a	Nice game and sank a lot of hours into it when it was new.  Alien, Predator and colonial marine are pitted against each others in an FPS fight to the death. If that's your cup of tea this may be an alright game.  Would not recomend because multiplayer community is dead at this point and the last time I was able to actualy play a game online it was infested with hackers.  Also awesome and gruesome finishing moves.
9217	0	a	[DISCLAIMER: This review is done based on playing the single player game on Hard difficulty only and comparing it alot to AVP 1999]  Had high expectations for this game. I played the first AVP (1999) gold edition and it's one of my all time favourite. Went through it and did all achievements and completed every normal and bonus level with Director's cut -difficulty. So I thought: 'Same people do an even better AVP game with better graphics in the same spirit as the original'  Oh how wrong I was. I started the game with nightmare difficulty, but soon realized there is no saving in levels. Even when I pressed 'save game' and even made a save file, it loaded right from the start of level. Frustrated, I started playing the hard difficulty.  I played first the marine campaign. It felt the aliens were too tanky, they took many bursts to head with a pulse rifle from a short distance before dying. And no use to bother shooting them in the body or limbs, because you'll be dead before you grind the alien to death. The story was very straightforward. No different ways to get to places and no use to run from the aliens, because in most cases the next event wouldnt trigger before you've killed every alien... I found that frustrating that - for example - it says 'survive until the dropship arrives' and you can run around for as long as you want and the dropship won't arrive before you've killed every single hostile. And that same thing went on in every campaign.   Also fighting the androids was very annoying as you can't crouch for cover. In fact any playable character cannot crouch in the game. The enemy marines and androids on the contrary could crouch and otherwise take cover. Also, the hit stun of the androids was kind of inconsistent as some times a shot in the body or head would activate stunned sequence and sometimes they wouldn't react anyway to continous spray of fire.     Also, the final boss couldn't be killed properly with other weapons than Smart gun with the manual aim... as other weapons did next to no damage, and the boss always one hitted me with a shotgun after a while.    The alien campaign was next on the line. I found the controls clunkier than the first AVP game, you couldn't climb every surface properly and had to press space to get into vents.   Also there was a terrible jumping section where you had to realise that you can use the automatic jumping function because manually jumping would only kill you in a cooling fan   Stealth killing enemies would have been fun, if not for the long fatality animations... During the fatality, your character is helpless and enemies can still damage you. Also the prompt to make a stealth kill doesn't always appear when it apparently should. Especially when you are attached on a wall, you can stick your alien-face to a marine's hair and still not get the prompt for a stealth kill. If you just attack in that situation, the marine won't die from the first hit, not even the heavy attack... And will alert the others nearby. This gets very frustrating after a while. In short, as in AVP 1999 the alien felt like an agile killing machine, in this game it feels somewhat clumsy and bugged.  Last campaign to go was the Predator. He has the power meter which wears out as you use energy weapons. In fact, you can get two fully charged shots and you're out. After that, it's close combat for you before you find the next power cell. Of course you can use the non charged shots, but they'll only stun the alien/human. The close combat is a nice idea, blocking, light attack and heavy attack... but as you get disoriented when attacking and there is a very inconvenient delay in the heavy attack (meaning, you can't hold to charge at all, the attack just comes couple of seconds after pressing the button and there is no way to hold nor cancel it). Add the fatality camera lock to the mix and you get very clunky close combat. Why would you ever use the fatality when it's slower to do and locks you still to be an easy target? Also the stealth feels a bit inefficient, but it might be just the hard mode. I never finished the Predator campaign, as the hand to hand combat irritated the hell out of me. Maybe it gets better later as you get more weapons... If I bring myself to play it to the end, I'll update this review accordingly.   That was all the negative about this game and the reason why I wouldn't recommend it. There was also lot of good stuff and I even if the levels were a grind in some places, it didn't matter as I like hard games. This game just was hard for many wrong reasons... And worst of all, it did worse job in many places than it's predecessor.  I can list some positive stuff in the end:  - Cutscenes introduce quite interesting story, being a fan of the franchise I liked it! - Predator and alien jump mechanics were quite good when you got used to them - Game looks overall good for it's age - The levels look good - Music is atmospheric (although sometimes the reactive music comes a bit out of place) - Marine campaign was scary at times - Mostly good pacing, quiet parts and action parts in reasonable intervals - Multiple hand to hand combat moves (even if the implementation was poor) - Fatalities and stealth kills look good, at least the first twenty times - I feel got my 5â‚¬ worth of playing already and there's still the predator campaign to finish and a couple of multiplayer modes to try with friends
9218	0	a	I can't say that I recommend the game. If you were a big fan of the series perhaps you would enjoy it, but then wouldn't you already own it by now? Additionally, just because the most dedicated fans may enjoy something, certainly does not make it good.  I bought this game on sale, thinking it would be a fun FPS to run through, but it really wasn't.   Pros
9219	0	a	The game is far too short. I've beaten all the campaigns once on normal and once on hard and it was not even challenging. I think the multiplayer is where the challenge is and tbh if you are new to the multi aspect prepare to get pawned for a while. So far in 19 hours I've done everything this game has to offer and then a little. The multiplayer is a bit repetitive and the final fights of the game are somewhat lack luster. The build up to that point is pretty good though. I am down voting it because while the campaign can be a lot of fun and the graphics and sound are great it simply offers too liittle and I feel that a good title should be able to give me more than 19 hours of game time.
9220	0	a	Half decent shooter, but can easily be missed. Overall gameplay is too simplistic, corridor shooter at its worst. Couldn't get more linear as even previously explored areas get cut off for not reason. Simplistic AI, which becomes a real weakness during hunter missions (as Alien or as Predator). Marine missions: incredibly basic and kinda boring. Weapons feel useless and clumsy. Alien missions: by far the best part of the game, rather fun. Predator missions: underdeveloped, especially as the available arsenal and abilities are very diverse. Plasma caster gets little use, first due to lack of ammo, later on due to much better weapons. Really dislike the inability to break actions like taunt kills or using objects. Pointless storyline, with ending that makes everything seems futile. Compared to AvP 2 from 2001 made by Monolith, this is a definite loser. 
9221	0	a	Oh boy just don't buy this, I love aliens and I love predator but, I don't love this...or even like it...
9222	0	a	Poor Multipalyer Balance,Full of cheaters,People using high pings to gain advantage
9223	0	a	I have a hard time recommending this game. I am a fan of the Alien-license (not a hardcore one that would notice plot inconsistencies, mind you) and picked this up on a Steam sale, and I just don't feel like playing any more of it. For reference, I only beat the Marine campaign and some of the Predator campaign so far, and I don't think I'll go and beat both that and the Alien campaign any time soon. Each campaign seems like it'll last you about 2-3 hours, considering I beat the Marine one in about 2 hours and felt like I got halfway through the Predator one.  Its not that I feel that I didn't get my money's worth with Aliens vs Predator (I paid, like, five dollars for it), but I think its not something you should get excited about playing. It works, the environments can be pretty, and it does feel like an Alien game, but the scenarios are bland and not very exciting, and the weapons feel like toys and aren't very satisfying to kill enemies with.   A linear, story-driven FPS needs more than just enemies that you point and shoot at. This genre requires satisfying gunplay mechanics and scenarios that give you an adrenaline rush, or make you feel tense. There have to be challenging rooms filled with enemies that come out of every corner, and you should feel awesome once you overcome that challenge!   Aliens vs Predator is so unexciting that even dying on harder difficulties didn't get me frustrated or angry - I just didn't care enough. At first I thought it was because I was playing the Marine campaign, but the few minutes I played of the Predator campaign were even worse. Again, its not that the game is awful or unplayable, but there are so many other story-driven FPS games that play better. Not every game can be Half-Life, Bioshock or Wolfenstein: The New Order, but a game this mediocre just isn't fun to play nowadays.
9224	0	a	Alright, here's the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing thing about this damn game. The campaign is true to the franchise and is very worthwhile and fun. There are three seperate campaigns for the three species: humans, aliens and predators. The singleplayer is all fine and dandy but the multiplayer is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   Most of the time it's pretty fun and intense multiplayer action. Playing as a marine is intense, spooky and pretty cooperative.  Playing as a xenomorph is exactly what you would expect if you've seen any of the movies. It's probably the hardest species to play because you'll need to be good at 1v1 combat, positioning and getting in and out fast.  The Predator on the other hand is an unbalanced, anti-fun and overall stupid species. I'm a big fan of the movies and Predators are by far my favorite.   BUT YOU KNOW LIKE MORE!? A BALANCED GAME! The predators are like the uninvited guests to a party, there are too many of them and they all ruin the fun for everybody. All they do is go stealth and shoot their stupid one-shotting boomerangs, spears and shoulder cannons. Every single ranged weapon is one-shotting. Their melee attacks do the most damage in the whole game, they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing knock you on to the floor with one light attack. They take the least damage of all the stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥ species.   Rebellion please fix your stupid mess, the whole multiplayer is broken and not fun anymore because there are always 30 predators, 10 aliens and 2 marines.
9225	0	a	The game does not feel like AvP. Even though I only played a few hours, I have to say that I did not like the game at all.  Pros: Nice graphics Nice sounds  Cons: This game is way too repetitive. 1. Do XYZ 2. Kill 5 to 20 aliens 3. I was able to open the door; now you can proceed. This stuff becomes boring.  The aliens are way too resilient in my eyes.  However, I guess some people will have fun with the game; for me it was/is not.
9226	0	a	Cons:  Music doesn't fit. Odd and clunky controls. Combat system is wierd (playing as a predator fighting hand to hand with a marine, forced to use block and counter type moves which doesn't fit well into this type of game). Absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever. Generally not fun-nothing will live up to AVP classic. Last but not least-contrived plot and cringe worthy dialouge just takes away from the whole experience-and tutorials.   Pros:  Decent FPS as the marine  Alien gameplay decent  Weapons look cool and pretty good graphics.  Overall a dissapointment but to be fair had high standards from the original AVP so was expecting alot.  
9227	0	a	Let's get the most obvious crap done with first: Would I recommend this game to ANYONE? No, I would not. Because it's absolute shÃ¯t.  There's a massive amount of crap that I absolutely hate about this game. First off, let's go with the EXTREMELY archaic and arbitrary score system. It's bullshÃ¯t like this that made me want to piledrive whatever shÃ¯tmunching â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥twÃ¤t at IO that thought it would be a good idea to introduce it into Hitman, so you can imagine how much I'd like it in what is supposed to be a simple gÃ¶ddÃ¤mn motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing SHOOTER.  Simply put, if you're a game developer and you're thinking of implementing a score-system into your game and you're NOT making arcade cabinets in the year 1986, then kindly rethink your entire â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing life and change your career, STAT.  Next up, the controls. Jesus â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' christ, who the gÃ¶ddÃ¤mn hell thought it was a good idea to make the predators ONLY be able to jump when aiming at a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ledge?! Hell, in AVP2, we could do that shÃ¯t just by holding crouch and then jumping, or however it worked.  Furthermore, the music. Wait... was there even music in this shÃ¯tty excuse for an alledged game? I sure as hell didn't hear any. The sound in general was bloody awful, even.  Difficulty level: BAHAHAHAHAHA!!! You're shÃ¯tting me, right?! There wasn't even any challenge AT ALL in most parts of the game. The AI was so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing atrociously ultra-dumb, it was almost as retÃ¤rded as the developers themselves are!  'Was it fun?' someone might ask. 'No', I'll plainly reply. It wasn't fun at all. It was boring, it was uninspired, it was dull and frankly, I'm glad I got it for a wooden nickel, or I'd be feeling completely cheated.  All in all, this game is an absolutely horrid mess of bullshÃ¯t. 2.1/10

9241	0	a	Better than the other Aliens game.. but still kinda crappy. Only one fun part in the game...and that's for like 1 hour.
9242	0	a	Human Campagin: Generic 1st Person shooter. Nothing Special but nothing terrible  Predator Campagin: Terrible Stealth Campagin couldn't even finish it  Alien Campagin: Mediocre to bad stealth action campagin. I made it through because it was so short.  Overall: Hey at least this playtime was from 2 whole campagins, maybe finishing the predator one would have made this 10 regretable hours  Avoid Game even if big fan of series- 3/10
9243	0	a	I played Aliens vs Predator rather late after release, but I don't usually hold a bias against graphics. And even so, the game is lacking in other areas. To keep this brief, it's better than Aliens: Colonial Marines (but then again what isn't) but not better than Aliens vs Predator 2 (yes, the 2001 title).  This game had one job to do: keep the mechanics intact (or improve on them) and update the technical aspects, but instead delivers a lesser game with upgraded graphics. This is especially apparent in the Predator campaign with the energy recharge mechanics being done away with entirely, the arsenal diminished and a trophy mechanic that is just useless.  I haven't tried the multiplayer, so I won't comment on it.  The bottom line is that this is not a bad game, it's just that there's already an older superior product you could play instead. I won't recommend it, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it if you end up picking it up on sale or something.
9244	0	a	A truley horrible game, they need to fix. I've been getting hit from 3 miles away from something that couldn't hit me, predators don't stop using the damm plasma cannon, all aliens do is loose, I get stuck on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ nothing, and marines who can't seem to man up just block all the time. Not to mention this horrifically embarassing 'Grab Glitch.' Please fix this broken game... (I see why many people left it in the first place, expecially multiplayer...yuck.}
9245	0	a	A true testament to 'all style no substance' approach in past-2005 gamedev.  Great aesthetics that still hold up ruined by shallow campaing, terrible controls (predator campaing made me punch walls) and general lack of polish.  If you're looking for re-imagining of glorious AvP campaing - don't bother.
9246	0	a	One of the many failed games based in the Aliens universe. .....The graphics are poor. So poor that it was hard to get that tense horror vibe that any aliens game should have. .....The universe was poorly created. Everything from the weapons and skins to the actual environments looked like faded copies of something done better by someone else. And considering how many times these have been done, that should have been the easy part. .....The games basic mechanics were completely broken: 1. The marines were cannon fodder. Their weapons were about as accurate as a kids nerf gun, and almost as effective. Marines spawned scatterd around the map as individuals instead of spawning near their teammates. Making them easy prey for predators and aliens. 2. The predators were overpowered. They had access to an array of weapons that were mostly one shot kills. The ability to go places that even the aliens could not, and the ability to see both enemies in almost all conditions. 3. The aliens were crippled by poor game design. Being able to play as an alien was the most aniticpated part of the game. Add to that that the aliens could move on any surface in the game, including walls and celings, and you had the makings of a great experience. But the aliens head could only move through a limited arc. And their body followed the head. So sudden changes in surface created sudden changes in direction. Usually in a direction you didn't want to go at a critical moment. Add to that the fact that the alien's attacks were weak and innaccurate. And you get something far less enjoyable than was anticipated. 4. There were only a few maps and they weren't designed well or very big. Enuf said there.  .....Everything above could have been fixed. And with not a lot of effort. But the developer abandoned the game almost immediately after it's release. Having played Aliens online in a previous age, and seeing all of the failed games using the Aliens name. My greatest fear is that there will never be a good fps made in the Aliens universe.
9247	0	a	And yet still better than Prometheus.
9248	0	a	It's not as good as you remember it.  5/10   Nostalgia fooled me again.
9249	0	a	I dont know if i need the DLC buti bought this game only for the multi player, And ive searched seprates times on seprate days and ive found no games
9250	0	a	Playing with marine is scary as hell. with alien, you feel like a hunter and predator is so cool!!! BUT, the game has LOTS of technical problems (visual and gameplay) .So if you are NOT a die hard fan of the series, just skip it. Or wait for the sale.
9251	0	a	A solid 6/10 rating. While not that great of a game, it was mildly fun and entertaining. Unfortuntely it fell short of being a game i would personally 'recommend'. With that said, purchasing this game would be no mistake to add to your game library, just easily passable and disregardable.  Biggest Pro/Con Key Points: +3 different unique campaigns all of which can be played at any time. -Story was non-compelling and endings were total lack lustors. -Most boss fights were poorly designed.
9252	0	a	I do not like Predators because they use weapons. If you use weapons that means you're weak. I mean seriously, why do they use weapons? Are they scared or something? Why can't they just use their bare hands? We have hands for a reason. Predators were not born with their weapons so that means they can't use weapons. If Predators are so strong then why do they get killed by humans?
9253	0	a	The game is actually really fun but no one plays it anymore. Only get it if you have 5-8 people who will also get it aswell. The campaign is really good too  Pros:  Good Campaign Fun If You Have People To Play With  Cons: Dead Multiplayer   FINAL VERDICT:  Not Recommended. I am an online guy and the multiplayer is dead, it has a good campaign, but it is still overpriced. 
9254	0	a	Entertaining at first, but quickly becomes a chore to play. Enemy models look great (especially the aliens) and combat was initially intense and visceral. Three separate campaigns are a great addition, but can't make up for the unconvincing environments, weak story, dead multiplayer, frustrating predator controls, and unsatisfying gunplay. Probably worth picking up on sale for fans of either series, but for anyone else, you can safely skip this.
9255	0	a	dont buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9256	0	a	says CO-OP, but there is nothing about this game that is co-op. Lonely and PvP again.
9257	0	a	The audio is excelent, the alien animation is excelent.  The feel of the game is just awful, I couldn't bring myself to complete the marine missions after getting maybe half way through, dabled with the predator, and was so dissapointed with too I'm afraid I uninstalled it without even looking at the alien missions.   Just so dissapointed after loving the original AvP and even AvP 2.
9258	0	a	Between a bizzarre melee system, a glitchy game engine, short campaigns, and clunky controls, this game pales in comparison to its predecessors. Buy either the original (on Steam) or, more preferably, AvP 2. This game fails to improve on either of those except graphics.
9259	0	a	I decided to stop playing this when, after completing the 'standard mediocre FPS' human campaign, the game actually got worse. Playing as a Predator was clunky and boring, and I lost faith that the Alien portion could salvage what was left.
9260	0	a	The atmosphere and graphics etc are all pretty good for a pick me up shooter but any game that doesnt allow you to aim your weapon down the iron sights is just wrong and not for me. I cant stand spray and pray, and screen crosshairs totally spoil the feel of any weapon realism. Why do people review games like this so highly when basic weapon physics are ignored. Arcade style and no doubt made for kiddy consoles. So glad it only cost Â£2.50
9261	0	a	For me, it doesn't convey the excitement of the 2000 version of Aliens versus Predator 2000. So if you're looking for a revamped game of that one, don't buy it. I mainly bought it for the experience of playing the Predator, since I liked that the most about the original version.  Pros: + nice graphics + nice cutscenes (in space)  Cons - Audio seems off: the grunts and clicks of the Predator don't feel like they should, for instance - controls are way too clunky (Predator jumping is stiff and feels like moving a chess piece to fixed locations) - fights are repetitive - you move from corridor to corridor, and that's about it  If you're NOT looking to replay the original AvP or happen to like corridor gameplay, then my review maybe doesn't apply to you. Check the other reviews to see if this game is for you.
9262	0	a	Pros: - Interesting perspectives from different teams - Interesting storyline  Cons: - Storyline that limits gametime - Few gameplay mechanics that actually do anything to enhance the gameplay - AI have some sort of sixth sense that allows them to see you from a mile away, then shoot with the accuracy of Bill Clinton when he served in the Oval Office with Monica Lewinsky under the table - Limited gameplay that does not allow for anything, really - Game price is not worth it, should be $2.99 - $4.99 - Gets extremely repetitive and boring after the first few missions - This game was made in the early 2000s. 'nuff said.  Review: This game is boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ after the first few missions. Same repetitive search n' destroy objective, same powers, abilities, and half the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ doesn't even have any meaning and/or benefit behind it (impregnating humans w/ alien bugs, ripping off people's heads from behind, etc.) Do NOT buy this game. Simple as that.  Overall rating: 1/10

9264	0	a	No multiplayer co-op other than survival mode unless you consider team PvP to be a type of co-op (I do not). Controls are stiff, clumsy, and hard to master, maps are mostly small. You can play as Predator, Alien, and Marine which is a nice feature and each has different attacks, weapons, etc that are derived from the various movies. Lastly, nobody plays this game anymore so unless you're going to PvP with friends you'll never find a game to join.
9265	0	a	If you've played the original 1999 AvP, be ready for a big let down. If you didn't, you may actually enjoy the game.

9270	0	a	Well, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I wanted to judge this game by playing it and without the opinion of others. When I was a console kid this game was friggin' amazing! Loved everything about it when I rented it for 3 bucks. Then I decided to get back into it again, and I remembered what I disliked so much about the game.   Melee is so strange, and it's made even worse when you add in the instant kills (known as E kill). You could lock on to individual targets, and then leap at them and attack, sounds good right? No, it's really quite buggy and sometimes really cheap. It features an auto-lock on and knocks back players who can't do anything when they're on the ground. So when you're trying to run away because you're being defensive, you get auto-lock'd and die in the most buggy mess I've ever seen. Blocking as an alien doesn't help, since the other guys have ranged weapons, and how your tail is used is weird.  So imagine trying to run away and heal, then getting back into the fight, but you're being auto-locked and getting e killed all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ time. It's not really fun, or strategic, and the maps are WAY too small to support three different teams fighting each other.  As for the campaign, the only one I found interesting was the Predator campaign, because the marine and alien campaign bore me so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ much. The synthetic levels frustrated me because I didn't want to fight robots. I wanted to fight predators and aliens goddammit.  This leads me to the alien campaign which makes me puke all over my keyboard because of how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ inconsistent the camera is. I don't feel like I have any sort of control over the alien, and that's what was important. The whole time playing as an alien the cam bothered me because it would look in all sorts of different angles and I felt like I wasn't in 'control.' Which led to some huge problems in multiplayer because everywhere I looked and moved it was a wall, or the floor, or a hazy mess. When I looked in a direction and transitioned to different surfaces, it would look in another direction which made the camera control completely confusing.  The only thing interesting is the predator campaign because you don't really fight synthetics, you're battling the aliens and marines all the time. It somewhat expands on the predator lore (though not much) and kept me relatively interested. Just enough to play all the levels.  At least the avp classic 2000 let me fight the alien queen as a final boss. Because in that game it kept me playing all the way to the final levels. Levels were scary, dynamic, well designed. Alien camera gave me control of where I wanted to look and when, the predator was powerful but balanced. Aliens were extremely quick and agile, but it requires skill and smarts to play.  In this version of AVP you just get speedhackers to do e-kills and in campaign you have a very boring terrible plot ride you're forced to go through.
9271	0	a	Aliens vs Predator is a very average game. The predator campaign saves the game from being mediocre but it doesnâ€™t do enough for me to give this game a positive review. The marine and alien campaigns are mediocre however and the story overall is very bad and forgettable. Level design is also just very bland and dull, no colour in the environments making the experience feel very dour, the game is very linear too. I donâ€™t like how they reuse the same environments between the campaigns it just feels lazy. It would have worked if the campaigns felt more connected but they just donâ€™t. The graphics are very nice for a game released in 2010, the DX11 features make the game look good even for todayâ€™s standards. Itâ€™s thankfully a very short game and I did have some fun with it but there is nothing about it that makes me want to recommend it, you are not missing out on anything by skipping it.  5/10 (Average) 
9272	0	a	Never has a game tried so hard to replicate the wonder of its predecessor than this (With the exception of Duke Nukem but we wont go there) Overall this isnt a terrible game which is a statement in itself that should promote warning from buyers. I had some solid fun over all in the predator missions, the colonial marines scenarios also were quite good but the missed opportunity was the Alien campaign, a real painful grind of mechanics and loading over and over.  In summary this game is worth a run through if you are big fans of any of the three IPs but otherwise i would say give this a miss and go buy Aliens Vs Predator 2000 which was by far the superior game.
9273	0	a	When you take a franchise like Aliens vs. Predator, it can be hard to imagine how you can screw it up. One surefire way, though, is to try and shoehorn an awkward melee system into the mix. Even better, why not include a lot of lengthy, scripted sequences every time you make a kill as the alien/predator. Sure, it extends the gameplay a little, having to watch a little one-act play unfold after a grab, but is it worth it?  And while you're at it, why not limit virtually every more the alien/predator does to scripted sequences? Oh, you want to climb into that vent? We wouldn't want you to just crawl right in there without having to stop and target the damn entrance like you're preparing to dock with it. And don't worry about those long jumps as the predator. We'll let you know if you're allowed to make them or not. You just relax and watch these overlong execution animations that we built the game around.  If you want a good AvP game, get AvP 2. If you want a great one, play the arcade version. Just don't bother with this one unless it's cheap. Or better yet, just watch an LP, since playing the game only involves slightly more participation.
9274	0	a	Not worth-a-buy even with a -75% on the price, unless you intend to play single player only.  This games multiplayer is dead, went in to find barely 4-5 servers with people, joined 3 and found speed-hackers in all of them, it would be an amazing game, almost as good as 2001 AvP2, if it was VAC secured, which sadly, isnt.
9275	0	a	After Rebellion disappeared it was Monolith that gave us the sequel to this franchise. That was back in 2001. Then, many years later, the news came that Rebellion again was working on an Aliens vs Predator game that felt like a reboot instead of a sequel.  Make no mistake: Aliens vs Predator is entertaining. It looks good, it plays well and it sounds good. Especially the sound is the key factor as those who saw the films of both franchises (who didn't?) want to hear the aliens screaming or the predators using their gadgets. Or the human beings scream as they fall victim to these monstrous creatures, right?  Then what went wrong? Well, Rebellion made an extremely short game. You have 3 campaigns but they all are very short and some of the areas appear in all 3 storylines. It is not necessarily a problem as these affect one another, it's just annoying that after 9 hours you have finished all 3 campaigns.  Unfortunately, by the time I purchased Rebellion's latest aliens game multiplayer had already gone dead. I was unable to find any games, thus, I simply cannot evaluate this part of the game. This also means that in case you wish to purchase the game it is completely pointless to buy its DLCs that are only multiplayer add-ons.  It's a shame Rebellion gave us a very short aliens game with multiplayer that went dead a couple of years after its release. I do not recommend it, in fact, I do not know which aliens game to recommend as the latest, Colonial Marines, was atrocious, but that's another story.  PS: Now that Alien Isolation came out perhaps there is a decent Alien game out there, after all. So far the reviews have been positive; Isolation will be my next game from this franchise!
9276	0	a	bad and boring
9277	0	a	Long time vet of AvP2, was really disappointed in this game. Everything was very 'automated' and just didn't live up to my hopes for a new AvP2
9278	0	a	Aliens Vs. Predator: The Doom 3 Edition.
9279	0	a	Huge AvP fan, got dissapointed tou. Huge lags on servers, no good dedicated servers, not enough content for the price i payed, some bugs and community died in like, 2 months after launch.
9280	0	a	It's a movie liscenced game. Made by Sega. The â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do you expect?
9281	0	a	As much as i love the alien franchies, do not buy this game. The story is nice but mulitplayer and the comunity is dead.
9282	0	a	Really Dissappointed when I finally got this game.  Let me stress that I thought the was going to be game to outshine and bring back my day of SERRIAs AvP2.  That being said...this was a huge let down. The game just mediocre at best. looks good but is basicly your average console port that doesn't require skill to play in multiplayer. Campaign is okay but short and the multiplayer is repeatitive.   If your an AvP fan. Then yea get it if its less than $5 bucks...otherwise pass
9283	0	a	I jugde only singleplayer. I've bought this game during some sale action, because I Love AvP theme, especialy Aliens. I've never played alien campain (in previous AvP games) and this predator campaing feel way too brutal. So I can comment only Marine part and thath is horible. Whole time a had a feeling 'Why the hell should I care or do it?' and 'What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this???' Aliens do not feel right and Marine's asault rifle is just weird, it looks weird, it dont kick, and you can NOT aim down sight. If you want to shoot some aliens, better take Colonial Marines.
9284	0	a	Was a big fan of the original AvP and AvP2 games but somehow this does not feel the same. Follows the same formula as those classic games, 3 distinct campaigns and a fairly standard multiplayer mode. Close combat has a strong rock, paper, scissors vibe but is not completely unplayable.  All in all I cannot help but feel that this game highlights how far games have come since the days of the original AvP games. Whilst it is nice to have three very different campaigns, all of them have been done better now. When the original AvP came out horror shooters seemed somewhat unique, but now there are tons of games that fulfil that niche. Similarly the idea of being a powerful hunter leaping around killing has been done very well in recent years (the Batman games come to mind).  If you are a fan of the franchise, then by all means get it, it is by no means a bad game but frankly you can find better.

9290	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ised AvP 2.  Aliens - Pretty tolerable stealth game. Marines - Less than average FPS. Predators - Don't. Just don't. Multiplayer - Apparently not dead.
9291	0	a	I have decided to use this recommending section to also not recommend a game. There is no place you can start with AVP. The single player is fine, You get the 3 breeds to play as, Human campaign, Alien campaign and Predator campaign so plenty to do. Just do not attempt the multiplayer it is terrible.
9292	0	a	The Marine missions were okay. The Alien missions made me dizzy due to the movements of the aliens and the predator ones where boring as hell. The overall story of the game isn't that great either it's very predictable which makes the game pretty dull. If you are looking for something that rival Alien vs. Predator 2 then look else where because this is not it.
9293	0	a	I am in a dark tunnel..... ok... Made it out.... Now i am in another dark tunnel....Hmmm.... OK..... seems like this game should be called 'The dark tunnel, Featureing : Aliens , and the Preditor....'  lets try Multiplayer..... NOPE, nothing there :(, No servers...  FOV is really bad, but thanks to the crap game play I dont think I am going to fix it.  0/10 will never get pooped on by and 'Alien' title again.

9301	0	a	Don't waste your time on this one Alien/Predator fans. Above all else, I feel this was just poorly executed. There are a few cool ideas but at the end of the day, the ideas don't redeem the uninspired story and buggy/repetitive gameplay. How did they manage to make a game featuring both Aliens and Predators so boring??
9302	0	a	If you had bad time playing  Aliens: Colonial Marines  and thought this would be the end of Â´Â´next generation`` for  Alien  franchise then stop by for  Aliens vs Predator 2010 . Is good and the graphics are much better than A:CM, but if you are an old gamer then you know this game isn't the best and will stick to the old ones. Like keeping with your vintage  Aliens vs Predato Gold Edition  or the classic of 1999.  I have mine in safe.Not mentioning too Avp 2 from  Monolith  other really good.

9307	0	a	Multiplayer in this game is horrible. Lag. Spawn-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Innaccurate and weak weapons. Aliens rule multiplayer. Marines are just sitting ducks. At least the graphics are improved. Still I've already played the entire single player on this game awhile back and I got it for the multiplayer which is just pathetic now.   If you buy, do it for the single player story. Online mode sucks unless you enjoy fighting over race slots and getting spawn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you don't get on the right team.
9308	0	a	The combat system plays like Guitar Hero. Press a button to do a certain action at the right time or you die... When I think about Aliens and Predators going at each other, the last thing I envision is rhythm based Parrapa the Rapper style button groove. What a joke. Proof that Sega just wants to take a great franchise and flush it down the toilet. I want my money back times a THOUSAND plus a written apology hand signed in the blood of the sega developers involved.
9309	0	a	I loved the original alien vs predator 2. I spent hours of playing it with friends. All 3 raced feeled so powerfull, but this game isn't up to it. Good ideas, but I never felt into the game. Too many cut scenes and just to 'easy'. Felt rushed and 'dumbed down' so it could be sold on all consoles and the PC. Would have loved to give it a good review, but I just cant. If you are looking for a multiplayer game with different races, try Natural Selection 2.
9310	0	a	Solid single player campaign, worth picking up on sale. The MP is dead, which sucks. I had super high hopes for this after growing up on the original MP AVP, but this one lacks substance. Its worth plowing through one weekend, but don't get too excited.
9311	0	a	Unlike most of the reviews, I would not really recommend this game. It's fun, but it gets old and repetitive very fast. The levels are continously recycled (You'll find the same levels you've already played through as marine, whilst playing as alien or predator). Multiplayer was fun, though. Good luck with finding players nowadays, the game is pretty much dead.   If you really want a great Alien experience, check out Alien: Isolation or AvP 2k classic (which is pretty much the only old steam game that's actually really well priced and updated!)
9312	0	a	The multiplayer balance is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the marines are to op because when you are an alien all of your atacks have like a knockback 1 also you don't have distance atack and marines mele atack wich is just punch in the face using fist have like knockback 10 and the aliens can't do anything because 3 seconds on the view of the marine and all aliens are dead. even the predator is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the multi because you can see him when he is invisible and also the plasma gun of the predator is too strong only tactic predator player uses is to stand somewhere heigh and wait for the enemy and killing him with one shoot kill charged shot also they lure alien players then run away stop and shoot aliens in the face wich of course have knockback and the finish them using blades even when you are the marine when you find the predator and start shooting him he will jump and shoot you in the face with plasma gun and it of coure knock you down and he will finish you with the blades those are the worst things in the entire multiplayer
9313	0	a	Single player is superbly awesome but short. Multiplayer is extreme to play, too many people with unfair disadvantages.

9317	0	a	Entertaining for the first five minutes, then you realize just go predator, and kill everything. multiplayer is about an fun as listening to katy parry on repeat. sadly disappointed, normally games made from movies are great.....right?
9318	0	a	Meh. While it has it's moments of fun, it's more of a constant let down. It seems the developers may have bit off more than they could handle story wise, game pace, and over all fun. While I still managed to get to the end, it was frustraiting to do so for all of it's lack luster qualities.
9319	0	a	I love Aliens vs Predator but good god does this game suck.  Don't relax just yet, marines.   EDIT: The multiplayer in this game is well worth whatever they're asking for pricewise (if it still works), but I don't know if ppl still play it. And the matchmaking isn't the best in the world. In fact, I can't remember if there even IS matchmaking. But yeah the multiplayer is good. Not quite good enough for me to reccommend the game, tho.
9320	0	a	i really could not get into this game, the story seemed repetitive and at times boring doing most tasks over and over again. the health system was kinda weak, 2 or 3 hits and ur done for. enemies seem overpowered to a point, most of the time i unloaded 2 clips into them and that even seemed not to stop them. and the weapons for the marine story besides maybe 1 or 2 where complete garbage barely able to put down any enemies. the predator weapons were cool but rather than that this game is kinda trash. i see what they tried to do but in the end we got a half â™¥â™¥â™¥ game based off a movie, and being a fan of both alien and predator i am deeply let down by this title.
9321	0	a	As a huge fan of the Alien and Predator movies this game fell extrememly flat for me. I'm glad I only picked it up in the Sega publishers pack a couple years ago.   The game holds your hand every bit of the way and recycles the same levels. The movement and combat feel extremely clunky and unresponsive. Voice acting is bland and has no depth. The horde mode of aliens also didn't do a whole lot for me as it was boring, bland, limited in strategy and repetitive.   The graphics aren't bad and everything looks decent for the age of the game. Other than that the only thing that I found interesting was the executions of the Predators. The Predator is by far the best character to play as but even the novelty of that wears off. It's a shame because personally I was looking forward to playing as a Marine.  After playing it for a bit it became clear that this game was not worth my time. Such a shame that recently no one can seem to do this liscense justice.
9322	0	a	Have ... an average campaign mode, and some fun moments but overall is quite warm for the 3 races.   and multi mode is simply a waste ... in 1 year I could only find one person to play.   as always fail of sega  ... tem um modo campanha mÃ©dio, alguns momentos bem divertidos mas no geral Ã© bem morno para as 3 raÃ§as.  e o modo multi Ã© simplesmente um lixo ... em 1 ano sÃ³ consegui localizar uma pessoa para jogar.  como sempre fail da sega

9327	0	a	It's been so long since I played this that I honestly can not remember much about it, only that I didn't like it and decided to uninstall. I do not recall there being any technical issues with the game aside from some POSSIBLE balance issues that I can not confirm, it simply had a playstyle I did not find that enjoyable. Others however are likely to love it.   Be aware that fans of the Colonial Marines are not likely to enjoy this as they seem to get their asses handed to them pretty consistantly (the possible balance issue I spoke of).

9331	0	a	The world of movies and games so rarely creates a successful marriage that somehow manages to bridge the gap between the two worlds, but here, lies an stunning example of an exception to that particular phenomenon. What we have here within 'Alien Vs Predator', is a game that so perfectly captures the essence of it's cinematic counterpart........ A truly terrible game of A truly terrible movie. Avoid unless you have a particular penchant for poorly designed and incredibly generic FPS games, created solely to cash in and leech from a much richer cinematic legacy.
9332	0	a	If you're looking for the old PC classic, keep looking. This is a streamlined and dumbed down version.
9333	0	a	Not AVP2 but has similar qualities. Single player is verey linear and multiplayer servers i found are desolate. Skip this and get natural selection 2 - its what AVP should be, minus the uniteresting campaign.
9334	0	a	A worse take on the classic AvP.
9335	0	a	This game seriously sucks. Sorry, but give me Far Cry any day.
9336	0	a	Just like the others. What else is there to say?  I didn't enjoy it.
9337	0	a	You may find some enjoyment from the Marine campaign, but the rest of the game is boring, boring, booooooring. If you`re not a big fan of the Alien\Predator franchise you should stay away.
9338	0	a	It doesn't have a co-op mode unless you count something like team death-match as a co-op game. The game is very linear and makes you run around the dark with a flashlight (remember doom 3?). It isn't scary, and the writting is atrocious. If you are bored and this game is selling for $5, it might be worth a look.
9339	0	a	It is easy... if You like Alien vs Predator universe, this is a good game for You.  On the other way... ...believe me, it is a game for one playing. Single player is very atmospheric (especially for alien), but also very short (5 hours whole game). Multiplayer is very bad because it is truly unbalanced and multiplayer mods do not allows the fun like other similar games. (little exception could be a Predator hunt, where marines try to hunt a single Predator)  So... I can recommend this game only to You if You are a truly AvP fan. Otherwise You will feel disappointed.
9340	0	a	Not as fun as the older  Avp Classic 2000  , It has some good things and some bad things. The good things about this game include Nice graphics, Balanced Characters, and Implimenting a sense of fear as marine. The bad things abour this game include Making The Marines Seem like the main villains, wierd logic (If you can shoot an alien as it drags you away, then why don't the other marines with pistols do it?), 'Meh' Storyline, and plenty of un-needed junk that adds nothing to the game. The games challenge level is for people who think Classic 2000 was too hard (Not for me!). If you do get the game, I reccomend sticking to multiplayer. If this game was cheaper and only included multiplayer, I would have enjoyed it more. This game is just below being in between good and bad (If i rated out of ten, it would be 4/10). This game is good for medium-level people who do not care about the AvP marines and storyline.
9341	0	a	For being only four years old, this game is not a looker. Heavily scripted corridor-shooter gameplay accompanies poor AI and a poor understanding of what makes the series great in this 2010 game. Only the Alien campaign feels halfway authentic, and even then you miss out on the bulk of the experience.
9342	0	a	I think this game is the worst.It lags too much to play and enjoy,do not get this game.I wasted money for sure
9343	0	a	i dont like this game at all remove steam pls
9344	0	a	No. This game is terrible. Beat the Predator Campaign on Hard in less than two hours. Decided to give the multiplayer a try.  Neither were worth 15$, nor will they ever be.  It's pathetic. Don't spend money on this.
9345	0	a	Find an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and eat it. Because that's basically what you're in for.
9346	0	a	The Predator campaign is the only redeeming factor in this game. The Alien one is too short and the Human one is boring and themultiplayer is no longer functional.
9347	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9348	0	a	In one word:Poor. NOTE completely subject to personal opinion! I absolutely LOVED the way the marine campaign starts though. The way you are introduced in is closest to homage to the movies universe of aliens that I can recall in videogame form other than Alien Isolation but that one is representing the first installment which has a different focus than the more action oriented aliens does. I loved the starting cinematics and atmosphere how you aboard a dropship that's falling down to the planet, lose your conciousness and have blurry memories from here and there how your squad is getting surprised by aliens. The way it is presented FEELS like the movie aliens felt like. Intense, action packed yet suspenseful and uber cool. But once the fps gameplay kicks in, it feels like a total let down for me personally. Suddenly the atmosphere shifts into a doom'esque fps gamemode and all that tension and atmosphere gets lost and you feel like just running and gunning. Also here is where the characters come in a nasty way. I don't know who came up with Tequila's character but man they sincerely dropped the ball in understanding Vasquez's character from the movie aliens. Tequila is the most annoying character in videogame history who is right up there with Bella from Colonoscopy Marines for me personally... The voice acting does not make things for the better, nor does the forced uber badass bravado and profanity filled dialogue of her.  Your character stays as unremorabable as ever and zero character development happens, which makes you NOT SCARED of dying in this game. I didn't care if my character got killed at all. It was just a mere 'bleh'   Actionwise some scenes work, like the disco scene with strobe lighting. Also the aliens swarming in the tunnel in the turrets scene works well. If the game had those moments as the norm rather than as an occasional oddball moment, it would be more enjoyable. I know a lot of people like this game's multiplayer, but I cannot comment on that because don't have people I know that still play this game. I tried the other campaigns as well and the alien campaign for me was most interesting which is shame because I think the marines campaign should have been given the same treatment. For me the marines are the heroes of aliens and their campaign should'nt feel bland. I've never cared for the aliens vs predators thing myself and I love both franchises in their own sandbox. I think predator is just as iconic as alien is but the two should never mix. Imagine someone mixing Star Wars with say, Firefly? Both would be messed up for life. I absolutely think daring mixing should only happen in the comic book universe for there are zero rules there. Anyone can kill Batman and bring him back to life as a vampire only to face off with aliens or judge Dredd or whatever whackiness that suspends any belief. And there it CAN work! Because Comics mostly happen haphazardly between the ears of the reader. Not so in film or games where you are an observer to the story. In films the rules are even more rigid IMO because your basically being spoonfed the information and cannot change anything happening. There is no interaction. In games you at least have some interaction. My point being here is that once you are in that position whether in film or game, that's supposed to be engaging for you, is that you have to keep it believable to a degree. Yes scifi is notorious for having unbelievable things happen but the key is making it seem believable. That becomes reallly hard to do if you have 2 franchises that have established themselves completely and utterly in their own domain but in completely separate universes and you are trying to force them together to create battle of a century. It may be down to a personal preference, who knows but I for one think established icons should keep their bubble intact. There's lots a competetent writer can do inside that bubble to keep things fresh, yet retaining the feeling that pays homage to the universe it is set in about. Maybe that's just it. Our pop culture is becoming saturated with less creative talent and that's why rubbish is the norm instead of iconic creations. I can already picture how some studio execs with zero imagination just looked at the sales spreadsheets of aliens and predator respectively and thought that's for sure going to make at least double when combined. It does not work that way!  I personally found this game lacking and lots of people think at least the graphics are cool, but I don't. In fact I think Colonial Marines on PC with tweaking and the patches released looks better than this. Simply because the locations are memorable from the movies. The locations carry the feeling from the movies even though they too are not nearly perfect and have a lot of toning down effect. Note that I'm not saying this game looks ugly, just somehow bland and uninteresting. The starting cutscene with all the cinematic effects on look great, but to manage the game for gameplay on consoles, all that is toned down in actual gameplay and that's when it starts looking bland. Looks a bit like doom3 set in aliens'esque universe but with less memorable moments...  I was disappointed in this game because when it was released, my hardware couldn't handle it, now when it can, it's too late. Graphics and execution has moved on and well, the gameplay is the same it was back then as is the story and execution. Incredibly enough I still have Colonial Marines installed and like to play MP on that one and the Stasis Interrupted DLC rather than this. But as I said, on PC you can change the graphics of Colonial Marines to suit better with powerful hardware.. So yes, this game DID not impress me one bit, as it seems to have made many other people like it especially after the ACM 2013 release. I don't always agree with angry Joe but with this game and ACM review, he was right. However ACM has got extensive patching and it's not the same title it was back then. It is though on many occasions too late to fix what was broken. I recommend trying ACM multiplayer on bug hunt rather than this, and it's on sale prices for dirt cheap. Just watch out for single player, there's no mod that can save it from what it was made to be. Although for me there's no difference between Bella, O'neil or Tequila. I dislike them the same and I'm pretty sure they are unwitting cousins or siblings.
9349	0	a	THIS GAME IS WANK
9350	0	a	No. This game is terrible. Beat the Predator Campaign on Hard in less than two hours. Decided to give the multiplayer a try.  Neither were worth 15$, nor will they ever be.  It's pathetic. Don't spend money on this.
9351	0	a	Find an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and eat it. Because that's basically what you're in for.
9352	0	a	i dont like this game at all remove steam pls
9353	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9354	0	a	this is a game that i played
9355	0	a	The Predator campaign is the only redeeming factor in this game. The Alien one is too short and the Human one is boring and themultiplayer is no longer functional.
9356	0	a	Compared to it's predecesors, this is not worthy of being an AvP title. The story is not only short, it's bad. It's almost like the characters don't meet at all. There's no AvP feeling at all. Multiplayer is even worser than singleplayer. Keep away from this. Glad I didn't pay for it. Waste of money.
9357	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
9358	0	a	Now, I've played Aliens vs Predator 2, and honestly, I can't believe I'm saying this.  This game is worse than AvP2, despite the years seperating the two. Sure, the graphics are vastly improved. Rarely have xenomorphs or predators looked this cool, but in all honesty, that's all the game did for the series. Despite no less than three singleplayer campaigns, you'll breeze through all three of them in a span of hours, while remembering nothing of the bland levels and almost-copypasted story.   If you're considering getting it for the multiplayer segment, don't. At least AvP2, despite numerous balance issues, required some degree of skill to play online. I swear, the multiplayer is so full of instant-death attacks it's not even funny. Sneak up on someone, he dies without being able to fight back (unless you're a marine. Then you don't get sneak attacks). Numerous predator weapons are instant death. Same goes for melee against xenomorphs. You'll be tearing at your eyelids, not because enemies are better, but because the game took too long recognizing that your character turned around, resulting in that charging xenomorph still being able to use a stealth kill on you. Even if he gets his head blown off before the animation is complete, it makes no difference, you're still dead.  Then there are numerous other issues, like how the maps from the Collector's Edition were unavailable to anyone who only had the standard edition, splitting the already scarce multiplayer community further and making those maps effectively worthless, since the majority of people playing couldn't play on those maps. Oh, don't worry, they released those maps as DLC already, so if you're willing to pay more than it's worth, you can also have those maps most people won't have. You can walk around, enjoy the sights! Alone.  And that's another thing that irked me beyond belief. The sheer lack of inspiring multiplayer maps. Most of them were ripped off completely from the campaign, with no apparant effort made to create special gameplay or opportunities for xenomorphs or predators. The whole multiplayer segment reeks of missed chances, while the singleplayer campaign just stinks.  If you are an absolute AvP fan, this game may give you some giggles before you too get annoyed at the design flaws, the lack of content or depth, and the DLC packages splitting an already dying multiplayer community. Otherwise, steer clear. Steer wide clear.
9359	0	a	You weren't going to buy this game. If you already bought this game, I'm sorry for your loss.  Bugged AI. Dead multiplayer. Unfixable, terrible, controls (you cannot fix 'no mouse wheel weapon selection').   Do not buy this game. Just watch the movies. It matters not which ones, as you'll still have a better experience than playing this.
9360	0	a	As an AVP fan boy, I am deeply disappointed and angry.  Oh my oh my, where do I start. I will say first and foremost, that I do not care for the multiplayer at all  What can I say, I waited for this game for years. I actually remember signing this online petition a few years back urging the development of another AVP game  I still consider AVP 2 to be one of the best games ever made  But when I was playing this game something was lacking. The substance of the story was lacking. I went back to AVP 2 again to figure out what was the biggest thing that drew me to the game. And it turns out that it was the intense story that was logically concluded in the end. When you played each species it was like you played a different game, even though it was the same game. It felt rich, it felt satisfying, you wanted to watch the cut scenes, as an alien you WANTED to hear the little conversations and dialogues of the puny people as you were running around the vents. For 2001, the graphics were and are still awesome.  I was thinking back to the deadly shadows that were all around me when I played as a marine. I remember being totally helpless. I remember conserving my ammo and conserving my flares that actually SAVED ME numerous times. In this game, you barely need the flares and they last for about 5 seconds!!! the pulse rifle feels weird. It takes a bit more than a second for it to start firing! No kidding. And I remember being scared $hitless of going into the hive and actually approaching the eggs. I remember dying instantly as soon as the face hugger got you. In this game however, on the HARD difficulty, you actually survive the face hugger attack - BULL$HIT  When you play the game as different species you slowly realize that the story is not connected at all. For instance when you play as a marine, and then you play the same map as an alien or a predator, you will see no trace of the other species' actions. You will not see anything that YOU have done as a different species playing the same level. In AVP2, the intersection of the three main characters is so subtle yet so enriching - you just realize 'oh $hit! I was on the other side of that ravine or whatever when I played as a predator' - and then you actually see the predator that you played before. It may be a little hard to explain, but those moments were simply gold in AVP2. They were rare but they made the game so much more fun.  In any case, I cant believe that in however many years it took them to make the game, all we got at best were 10 hours of single player campaign with recycled maps.  When you play as a marine and you get to the first cyborgs AND if you play on hard - like I always do - you will get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ handed over to you. why? well, because you CANNOT FLUCKING DUCK, seriously what is up with that? Thus you cannot take cover from the cyborgs and in a straightly linear map you will have to run all the way back while trying to shoot away at the chasing cyborgs!  I hated the melee system. I really do not think that it is realistic for a marine to block an alien's or predator's attack single-handedly. I would have none of that in AVP2. There would not be the slightest chance of surviving 2 xenomorphes close to you on a hard difficulty. But in this game, all you have to do is punch them away and then bast them - bull$hit.  The alien cannot make the forward leap ahead, unlike in AVP2. In AVP2 it was so compelling to make these long distance jumps and try to tear apart your prey. Now you cannot do that in this 2-3 hour alien campaign. And why do we need to have a special action button to access a vent or a small space to hide in? I guess it's for the console people. I still do not understand how you can play a fast-paced shooter on a joystick and compare the mobility to when you play it on a PC with a fast mouse, but that's another story  Audio logs are also bull$hit. They last for a few seconds, and when you try to listen to one, you usually have to press TAB - by default, but then you end up pressing ESCAPE twice to get back into the game! what's the problem with Bioshock's system of audio logs? press the button and listen, why is there a need to try to leave two menus?  I didn't like the predator jumping system - again, was that supposed to make it easier for the console people to jump or something? in AVP 2 you have to carefully time your high jumps and you have to rest for 2-3 seconds before you are able to make another one. And no, you didn't have the nice cursor which would guarantee you landing on your desired spot, you had to do MORE work. Now there's an imbalance, since you can jump 30 feet ahead, yet you can't jump over a 10 foot fence  Once again, the melee system makes the game, I dont' know, a bit weaker. I remember the DARK MESSIAH game, a great game which in my opinion, implemented the BEST melee weapon system, but it does feel out of place here. AVP should be more lethal, marines should not be able to block incoming alien and predator attacks  Also, as an alien, what's up with the navigation help? You press shift near the enemy and your screen starts to shift towards your unaware enemy lest you miss with your claw or tail attacks - once again, that was designed for the console people, since there is no way in hell you can use your controller to rotate 360 degrees at a time sucessfully without getting disoriented, only the mouse can do that  As a predator, you cannot collect skulls as trophies anymore  As a marine, in AVP 2, you ACTUALLY had a personality. Your nickname was 'Frosty' and your character was actually shown in the cut scenes. You were ACTUALLY interacting with people. Now, what is the problem with this game? All we know is that you play as a 'Rookie', you don't have a voice and you don't even know what you look like. I don't know, for me its a big minus. I wanna be able to forget about this crude $hitty reality as best as I can by getting fully immersed in video games like this, instead it just feels like a typical DOOM type shooter. I mean in this game, your character as an alien '6' and as a predator 'Youngblood' are actually shown. But our own race of humanoids was not even developed by giving our character a name and a face? but whatever  I would give $ 50 or $ 100 or even $ 200 right now for the original AVP 2 game to be re-made with the graphics used for this game, but even that is not needed. The charm and absolute genius of AVP 2 remains unmatched. This game doesn't even scratch the surface. AVP2 had a creepy and rich atmosphere that this game just doesn't have. I just HAVE to beat AVP 2 one more time, like right now.  The Pluses: 1. checkpoint system. It makes the game more challenging 2. Close kills 3. Graphics 4. You can't carry more than 3 weapons as a marine which makes the game more realistic  ( I really cant think of anything else)   The Minuses: 1. The story sucks a$$ 2. The levels are recycled by the 3 species 3. NO DUCKING. 4. The melee system is bull$hit 5. Short campaigns 6. Stupid predator jump system 7. The alien isn't as mobile as in AVP 2 8. The AI is pretty dumb. 9. The pistol has infinite AMMO - no kidding, what a load of BS  I'm guessing on its own, I could tolerate this game, but since I cant help but compare it to AVP 2, I had to resort to making this review. And I guess the more I hoped for this game to kick â™¥â™¥â™¥, the more disappointed and sad I got. It's always best to not get your hopes up too much.
9361	0	a	If you have played Aliens vs. Predator Classic 2000 then you will feel as if there's a lot missing....
9362	0	a	It could have been a great game. Ended up being mediocre at best. Not worth the money.
9363	0	a	the reason i changed my mind is because im really an aliens fan and i love playing as the marine, but the thing i dont like is being killed every second. and also the predators are way too overpowered. and last, when marines are all in a group....... it doesnt matter because predators will blast them, xenomorphs will overpower them to easly, or even the xenos will slowly kill off all of the marines with the E grab, and most of the time predatorrs and xenos are coming at all of the marines. so if your an aliens fan dont get this game....... buy aliens colonal marines. But if your a predators fan then buy it. But i warn you this game can give you serious medical and mental problems cause it can give really bad stress. This game is so terrible im never gonna play it again, this is not worth your time and money. This game is an epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!
9364	0	a	i can never get my money or my life back on this worthless piece
9365	0	a	The name doesn't mean anything. Aliens vs Predator (2010) has more in common with the horrendous Alien : Resurrection on Playstation and Aliens : Colonial Marines than with Aliens vs Predator Jaguar, Aliens vs Predator 2000 and Aliens vs Predator 2.  At least, it is a little more enjoyable than Aliens : Colonial Marines... But that's not enough to convince a facehugger to hatch from its egg.  Rating : 6.0
9366	0	a	While the mode in which you play as a Xenomorph is friggin' awesome (if a bit weird to control), it lacks any length to make it fully enjoyable and is hampered by a rather dull and lifeless environment.  Fun at first but nothing there to keep you coming back.
9367	0	a	(Only played single-player.) I just couldn't be bother to stick with it. A strong start on the Marine campaign with great atmosphere, but the shine wears off. Xeno AI was laughable and immersion-breaking at times. The Alien and Predator movement and combat are noteworthy, but there's not much game behind their mechanics.
9368	0	a	We should have expected a game at least as good as AvP2 that came out in 2002... But no, this game failed on both solo and multiplayer experience.  Solo campaign was short and missing all the fear elements of the genre.  Multiplayer was dumbed down, lacking all the superb variety of gamemodes and different types of playable characters. Yes you can play a pretorian alien... But it's only a skin. No specialized marines either, same for predators.  By it's own it's not that bad of a game, but if you expected a good sequel to the great AvP games, this is not it.
9369	0	a	This is a great game!! Well.....it used to be anyways. This game has very much died and I don't mean nobody plays it anymore. I mean its lost its players, players that don't use hacks or glitches in the game to win a match. There are only a few solid players that you can play with anymore and thats why I have to switch from a positive review to a negative. The game just isn't fun anymore. I remember first buying this on steam and things seemed dead already because the game lacked players but I did find some good matches where everyone just played the game but now. Now I see why so many people have stopped playing.  I recommend this game but I also don't recommend this game because the most fun you are going to have is probably completeing the campaign and maybe a couple vs matches if your lucky. Now maybe you might have a better experence than I did but maybe you won't. In the end the choice on buying or not buying is up too you. I had to switch my review for this game becuause my feelings have changed. ................................................................................................................  The truth of the matter is...I have very mixed feelings about his game. Deathmatch multiplayer, I will rarely do it because that is where the most hacks and glitches come in. Now this is just my opinion and I am not in any way bashing this. The game is really reallly fun! I love it allot but it is not a game you can play forever. I origianlly had a positive review of this game and it was shorter than this one.   This game is fun! I will not lie and say 'This game sucks!! Don't buy it!!!' That is not true because it is worth the buy. Worth the buy with the consequenses of buying it. The results of this game are as follows. These are just my opinion! Some people might not agree but this is how I feel.  Negative Things:  Hackers are everywhere and they do not reason with you or stop when you ask them too (like most hackers of any game)  Loaded with Glitches and people who will use them too win the match  The community has a big group of just cruel people who will make fun of you for certain stratagies that you use.  All dedicated servers are pretty much gone and nobody plays them, maybe one or two are open a day.  Player made matches are usually one on one and they will be higher level than you so get ready for some pain there. (if you just bought the game)  The game has its momments of crashing randomly and freezing making you have to restart your PC and I have a good PC and it does this too it too.    Positive Things:  Very creative campaigns and a fun Nightmare difficulty to push your limits!  There are some solid, fun, kind people who still play this game.  Many different multiplayer options that you can choose from  and finally its a very good time passer, you can play several hours of it      That is how I feel about this game, thank you, I just wish there was a mixed feeling button instead of negative or positive
9370	0	a	Crap game overall due to poor multiplayer and very limited campaign
9371	0	a	This game was awful!!
9372	0	a	Though AVP had the potential to be a good game with promsing features such as good graphics, accurate to the movie guns and sound effects, and interesting locations. There are several things that actually prevent this from being a good or even fun game. First is that each of the species campaigns all take place on the same 4 or 5 levels they just focus on different parts of them. second is that the poor voice acting and bad ai eliminate any hope of being immersed in the 'plot' at all. As any non human species you'll definitely hear the phrase 'don't relax just yet marine' countless times during your game. lastly the game tried to incorporate a multiplayer feature however in my entire duration of owning the game i have never found another player online so i'd just let that speak for itself on its quality. As a fan of both the Aliens and Predator series i was thoroughly dissapointed by this game.
9373	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9374	0	a	Fun, yet underdeveloped in terms of each character's story, which feels extremely short, though engaging.
9375	0	a	singleplayer is great, but multiplayer is extremly unbalenced
9376	0	a	Don't bother. Not in the same league as the original
9377	0	a	feels like Zeno Clash with AVP skins boring Singleplayer campaign dead Multiplayer with cheater, exploiters, glitchers
9378	0	a	Really bad game
9379	0	a	buffering kinda cool
9380	0	a	Standar corridor shooter. Pretty boring unless a fan of the universe.
9381	0	a	Alien vs Predator tm is a good game and im not being a hater saying this but Because of the problems iv had with this game the npc problems im gonna thumbs down this game.(im thumbs down because of the alien mode and the npc problem with the dr! the other 2 modes are fine!)
9382	0	a	Terrible. The only reason I bought this was for multiplayer.  A fancy, pretty, sparkly version of rock, paper, scissors.  There is no aiming. The game aims for you. And if someone manages to get behind you for a single moment while spamming E, you get auto-killed. Then usually someone else will auto-kill that person, and so on and so forth.  It's basically so dumbed down that a toddler, a dolphin and an adult could all play each other and get similar scores.  The result: only worth playing if you are completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9383	0	a	For mediocre alien fans like me this game is so-so.  Pros:  -Looks good. -Good for a quick playthrough Yes thats all.  Cons:  - Actually the sounds are good but has no dinamics at all. Everything sounds flat. - The marine campaign is not scary at all. The predator is much like a stealthed ninja rather than a superior alien race. - Limited weaponry at both the marine and the predator. BTW the combat rifle is joke useless.  - The game was intented to be an MP game and it affects the SP gameplay too. The characters are way too balanced. The marine is too strong, the predator is a weakling, the aliens seems to be the most acceptable. In SP IMHO the marine killed more alien than the predator. - I don't like PVP MP (except a very few game) and half the achievements made for PVP. - Incredibly short, bad and clichÃ©ed story. Short, even with 3 campaigns. - No saves, only checkpoints, and a cheap difficulty system with 1-hit-kills. On hardest level even no checkpoints. Put it together: No saves, no checkpoints, 1-hit-kils. . .enjoy frustration!  The Alien vs Predator 2 (2001) still the best. Extreme good and grandiose stories affecting each other. Scary marine and the predator superiority campaign. The alien campaign is so good i nearly felt the hunger for more meat. The marine's weaponry is awesome and the predator's bone gun is hardly forgetable. More vision modes (human 2 / alien 2 / predator 4). Blah, blah.  This Alien vs Predator is actually not such bad game though, only short and boring. Disappointing.
9384	0	a	The good: + Great graphics if your computer can handle it. + A lot of mechanics (not good, but a lot). + Great sense of control.  The bad: - Rock, paper, scissors melee combat. (Humans shouldn't be able to beat an alien by punching their face, wtf!) - Poor design, both for controls schemes and mechanics. Where the earlier AvP game was epic this one lacks depth and feels like 1 step back. - Multiplayer sucks, period. It's also dead anyway. - No versatility and no advantages related to each race. - Close-to-zero graphics support, e.g. no FOV settings. - Poor story, lackluster overall. - No balance or appeal.  Overall rating for me, 3/10.  I'd like to elaborate on mechanics. In the earlier versions of the game we were set with 3 different races: Humans, aliens and predators, and each of them had several advantages and disadvantages. On top of that, each class had variations, e.g. predators could be standard ones (beefy guys with blades, a combi-stick, a plasma cannon and a disk), also a heavy variation (plasma pistol, combi-stick, slower movement, more health, spear rifle...) and so on, here we are set with the same versions for everyone, where some stuff outshines the rest.  On top of that, mechanics have changed since the last installment. - Humans could gain the upper hand using the heat radar, clump up in a choke point and mow enemies down with a shotgun, a minigun, whatever.  - Aliens could sprint across walls, stun and feast on unsuspecting enemies, leaping across the map and capitalizing on mobility and dodging attacks. - Predators had average speed and could jump a little higher than humans, but they had their cloak to stalk enemies and kill them from stealth. They had worse weapons than humans' and worse mobility than aliens', but they made up with free healing and energy replenishment on demand, and were capable fighters both in melee and at range.  In this game: - Humans can beat both predators and aliens (who have metal-shredding claws, acid, melee weapons...) using their bare fists. On top of that they have the range advantage since most of their weapons hit instantly and deal a lot of damage, and they still keep their heartbeat sensors. This makes them one of the preferred classes by most players. - Aliens are the rant class. All they have that others don't is wall-crawling, and they are easily beaten in melee by anyone in the game, which makes them useless. - Predators have autoaim plasma cannons, cloak, stealthy weapons and much better mobility (probably the best in the game, even better than aliens). They no longer have on-demand healing and their energy has been severely nerfed (very low reserves and needs power sources to recharge) and that's a pity. Also their weapon arsenal has been reduced greatly and some weapons are useless (like the combi-stick, which is now a throwing spear) since they are heavily affected by lag, which happens in any online match.  In short, the mechanics have been turned into garbage, thrown into the trash can, recycled and taken a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on afterwards, because there's barely any fun outside the campaign.  Final verdict, buy it at a super discount (like 3-5â‚¬) if you want to play the campaign, which isn't the worst experience ever but it's more about hunting for collectibles than paying attention at the lackluster story.
9385	0	a	What is this?!  Cant even describe how good is Aliens: Colonial Marines, and how bad this game is! They gave us 3 characters (alien, predator and marine) how can they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up so bad?  Multiplayer is dead, and was dead since the beginning... Nice!  When you play as marine, you wake up alone in the dark (because everyone was slaughtered by aliens) You try to navigate in complete darkness, even your flashlight emits darkness. After you reach the surface, you must regroup with your fellow comrades. But they will die anyway! So you just simply alone 100% of the game! Brilliant! There is no co-op even! Your weapon suck balls, this new pulse rifle is a spit in fans face. You can even kill predator without any effort. AI is dumb what else did you expect?  When you play as alien, you using stealth tactic to kill marines which will be dumb because of AI obviously, and face many bugs on your way. You can crawl on the ceiling and get yourself dizzy, i puked everything i ate recently, thanks!  When you play as predator, you just scream like a little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and going straight forward with your overhyped invisibility! The end  0/10 Karl Bishop is android

9393	0	a	AVP is/was a great game, and the multiplayer was great, and I find it surprising that nobody plays it anymore. Not even 3 months ago, I went to search for a multiplayer game and found a match fairly quickly, it was completely full and I really enjoyed it, later I left the match and went to the server browser, there was about 15 servers up, all of them had at least 6 players on, which isn't too bad. I returned to the game today to find no servers up, and I went to quick play and it said only one other person was looking for a match. I really miss the multiplayer, and I wish I played more of it.. Oh well...  If you were thinking of buying this game, don't buy it unless you're alright with paying $15 for a very short campaign.  3 months ago: 7.5/10  Today: 1/10

In this game: - Humans can beat both predators and aliens (who have metal-shredding claws, acid, melee weapons...) using their bare fists. On top of that they have the range advantage since most of their weapons hit instantly and deal a lot of damage, and they still keep their heartbeat sensors. This makes them one of the preferred classes by most players. - Aliens are the rant class. All they have that others don't is wall-crawling, and they are easily beaten in melee by anyone in the game, which makes them useless. - Predators have autoaim plasma cannons, cloak, stealthy weapons and much better mobility (probably the best in the game, even better than aliens). They no longer have on-demand healing and their energy has been severely nerfed (very low reserves and needs power sources to recharge) and that's a pity. Also their weapon arsenal has been reduced greatly and some weapons are useless (like the combi-stick, which is now a throwing spear) since they are heavily affected by lag, which happens in any online match.  In short, the mechanics have been turned into garbage, thrown into the trash can, recycled and taken a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on afterwards, because there's barely any fun outside the campaign.  Final verdict, buy it at a super discount (like 3-5â‚¬) if you want to play the campaign, which isn't the worst experience ever but it's more about hunting for collectibles than paying attention at the lackluster story.

9409	0	a	This game is good if it is on sale but only if that. The Multiplayer is completely dead at this point and the single player is very short for each campaign. Not really much depth to the story either.
9410	0	a	well i...i dont now what to say it looks fun but when i first played it and i wa an alien the humans walked like ais and its lags alot so what do i say to this game well its sucks its may be because i have bad wifi but the multi player i cant get one single game i spend some of my money on this to figerout that this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game i want a refond or some think thats what i think about this game
9411	0	a	I loved AVP and AVP2 when they were released back in early 2000. AVP2 Gold sets the benchmark of this franchise and I would still play that over the latest AVP from rebellion. It lacks some of the original features and gameplay with poor mechanics and lack of depth and feel in single and multiplayer.
9412	0	a	Unfortunately, this game has nothing good in it. As for singleplayer, the gameplay will bring you 10 hours of pure frustration, which can be handled by a pure saddist... Multiplayer is absolutely empty, that's right, no one plays in this game. And DirectX 11 features is a total joke. The same joke that was few years ago with Crysis 1 and DirectX 10 support. So, saying overally, the game is boring, unfair, total pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ which was perfectly advertised in marketing campaign, beyond that, there is nothing, nothing at all.  If Duke Nukem Forever is the worst game of 2011, then Aliens versus Predator is the worst game of 2010.  I am totally NOT recommend you to buy this game. Leave it resting in peace like it is doing currently...
9413	0	a	Terrible, in practically every way. Worst $5 I ever spent. Just skip it, and go play the old ones like AvP2 or something instead.

Appear more often in games or cheats in the game joins problematic players with high pings at 1000 minimum who had bad intentions as the other players screwing up the whole play and do the normal nerves players  Singleplayer: -------------- + Graphic and sound + Story   Multiplayer: ------------- - Servers with low power and slowness - Players with high ping - E grab and Violence - Lags  - Trolls while in games  I don't recommend ... !!!
9419	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible game, it was terrible due to the overly obtrusive GFWL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to the total crap single player campaign. I mean honestly what the heck it has this lousy cheat checks that constantly crashes because apparently it thinks my AV was a cheat, seriously what bull. I had to turn off my AV to play this game properly. Regardless, the single player was pathetic, bland storyline, overly clichÃ©, and the color palette available for this game doesnâ€™t help it much. I get you want us to use the flashlight but my god would it kill you to add a couple bright lights or something? The multiplayer is the saving grace of this game; however the lack of maps and expandability makes the multiplayer fairly weak. The game is already heading a dying direction. Donâ€™t buy this game unless you can find it ultra cheap. 2 dollars cheap.
9420	0	a	Compared to Colonial Marines, its not a bad game but thats not a real high bar to aim for. Compared to the orgial, its really boring. The action is very cliche and its not really that challenging. At most your fighting 2 enemies at a time which makes the action really boring. Your better off playing any other game.

9422	0	a	I was really excited when I saw this game on steam because I had played a lot of it on console and could now play it on my rig. So I buy the game even though I really can't afford it right now (That's steam for you lol), I start the instalation and go to work.  I come home around 11pm, start up the game and I dont even care what the matchup is, I put 'any' on all options, quick match it, and wait. I'm the only one online at all. I go to ranked, same thing, only one online. I browse all the lobbies, 1 guy is on, I try and join his game and get a connection time out. At first I blew it off as being later, not a lot of people interested in the game so I need to log on mid day. I log on mid day, same thing, I am the only one online. It is really unfortunate because the only reason I wasted my money on this game was for online play and it turns out that on a rare occassion I will be lucky to 1v1 someone, which is nothing like the large games I used to love with multiple races.   In the end, I would not recommend this game to anyone, simply because the community is completely dead. I dont feel it's worth the money for the campaigns alone. I will just have to continue to remember how awesome it was to play with other people, and when the solo missions are done again, let it build dust in my steam library.
9423	0	a	Play AvP 2 instead...This is a complete waste of the IP.   The campaign pretty much threads old ground and is exactly as you would think it would be, broken into 3 parts that semi-overlap and pretty much end in the 'Weyland Yutani is evil' rethread that anything to do with Aliens, can't seem to avoid.  Playing as the humans is quite dull, no real scares and no real threat as you can easily knock aliens back with melee. The Aliens would be more fun if they weren't so disorientating though that's always going to be an issue. Predator is where you'll get your enjoyment, murdering helpless humans and aliens alike.  I enjoyed the multiplayer when it was first released though it was quite shallow and basic. I think this aspect could have been so much better than your bog standard deeathmatch, team deathmatch etc.  Pick this up when it invetibaly drops to a handful of sense for the Steam sales if you want but I wouldn't advise picking it up otherwise. Stick with the old games in the series.
9424	0	a	Wow! They did it! They ruined two franchises at the same time!

9428	0	a	Aliens vs Predator returns and, while the game gets some elements right, it's too bogged down in ancient game mechanics to be a winner. With three short, flawed campaigns for single players and a variety of passable multiplayer games, it's a lopsided production that will disappoint even the most ardent fan.  The Pros Excellent character models Aliens are fun to use Multiplayer is rather fun  The Cons Looks like a 2010 game, plays like a 1999 one Insanely frustrating control issues with targeting and kill moves. Marine campaign is completely uninspired  Way back in 1999, developer Rebellion finally made the dreams of sci-fi-loving gamers everywhere come true. They managed to develop a game based on the Alien and Predator film franchises that lived up to expectations. The first-person shooter captured the elements of each race in an exceptional way, and provided PC gamers with a thrilling blend of horror and action. Sadly, what worked over a decade ago doesnâ€™t necessarily work now, and after playing Rebellionâ€™s Aliens vs Predator reboot, it appears that theyâ€™re still partying like itâ€™s 1999.   Aliens vs. Predator   Weâ€™re Mincemeat, Man!    Thatâ€™s not to say Aliens vs. Predator is without merit. Itâ€™s still fun to scamper across darkened ceilings as a Xenomorph (the technical name for the Aliens), drop down on unsuspecting, terrified Marines and eat their brains. As a Predator, thereâ€™s still a sense of menacing satisfaction when tracking prey through the jungle, then jumping down and ripping their spine and head out. Even the uninspired colonial marine campaign has its moments -- especially near the end when some epic firefights occur.    But all in all, itâ€™s only in fleeting moments where the game really thrives. The story unfurls like a continuation of the god-awful movies, in which Lance Henrikson plays the head of the self-serving and vile Weyland-Yutani corporation. Weyland (now basically cloned over and over) is utterly obsessed with harnessing the Xenomorphs and using them as a bioweapon to make his corporation rich. To that end, heâ€™s using an entire base as his personal science lab.    When Weyland discovers an ancient Predator ruin, a signal is inadvertently sent out to the hunters to come and do what they do best. Aliens escape and chaos ensues; thereâ€™s not a shred of originality in the set-up. The gameâ€™s dogged use of standards from the moviesâ€”right down to all the same sound effects--is partially understandable, yet, ultimately, it feels lazy in presentation.       Three Sides to Every Story    As in previous games, AvP is broken up into three chapters. The human campaign is easily the worst. It has every tired, overused shooter clichÃ© from the late â€˜90s. You wake up alone, with only a useless pistol, while some faceless entity keeps barking orders at you. Worse, you donâ€™t even get a name or a voice. Your character is just called â€œRookieâ€ and never speaks. He can only carry two other weapons, and his progress is completely linear. Humans always did seem extraneous in a war between the two ultimate sci-fi predators, but the developers seem determined to prove how weak and ineffective humans are here.    The Predator campaign is hardly an improvement in game design, and suffers from the same sort of linear pacing. Whatâ€™s worse is that Rebellion has actually made the Predator feel wimpy. Although itâ€™s hard to imagine, your Predator is weak, goes on the hunt barely equipped, and only gets new weapons as the story dictates. He also has to find energy sources to suck up to power his gear, which is a suspect game mechanic at best.    The Aliens are the most interesting species to play by far. The sheer joy of blazing across any surface is enough to give the Xenomorph campaign a leg up. Combat is problematic, but once you learn to properly hang to surfaces (hint: hold the button down all the time and you can move from surface to surface without hesitation), theyâ€™re just fun bugs to play as. Itâ€™s a shame the Alien campaign is the shortest at just about three hours, compared to four or five for the others. All three species go over common ground as well, so expect to the see the same sights a lot.   Aliens vs. Predator   Kill Your Friends    The controls for both extraterrestrials are the biggest problem. Targeting in the game is simply sloppy. Since youâ€™ll spend a lot of time in melee combat, the game ideally should have a targeting system that makes focusing on prey simple. Instead, you suffer through an impossibly twitchy targeting control that usually leaves you overshooting your enemies with your back exposed and no idea where they are.    Another severe issue is the use of fatalities. Both aliens can perform grisly death moves, but doing so locks you into an uncontrollable canned action for several secondsâ€”more than enough time for any nearby enemies to kill you. While these moves are cool at first, thereâ€™s only a few of them and youâ€™ll tire of them quickly.    Thankfully, there is multiplayer, and itâ€™s entertaining in spots, but it wonâ€™t force you off any online shooters you might be currently playing. Pitting the three races in a variety of deathmatch and species-based games is generally fun. Each species has their own special game, such as Predator Hunt, a Juggernaut variant in which one player takes the role of a Predator seeking to hunt down opponents. If he gets killed, heâ€™s replaced by his assassin. The Xenomorph version tasks a player with infecting all of the Marines on a map. Most of the multiplayer maps, much like the single player levels, are merely serviceable. There are two excellent co-op survivor maps, in which up to four marines battle endless waves of Xenomorphs, not unlike Horde mode in other shooters. The multiplayer is fun, but not deep enough to draw much lasting power for many players.  Aliens vs. Predator  In Space, No One Can Hear You Sigh    Aliens vs. Predator isnâ€™t an awful game, but it is incredibly disappointing since Rebellion appears to have done so little with the source material . Itâ€™s a hard sell when there are significantly better shooters available, both online and offline. While the game isnâ€™t a total loss, thereâ€™s just not enough here to make the game recommendable. As it is now, AvP is mostly a visually updated version of an eleven year-old game, and thatâ€™s not what fans of the franchises or first-person shooters deserve.
9429	0	a	Ok... So I'm about 2/3rds of the way through the game. Completed the Predator campaign and the Alien Campaign.  Its a Decent game. The original Alien vs Predator is better in my honest opinion.  The campaigns are incredibly short as you can see above and with my Hrs on Record... 3.5 hours and Ive gone through 2/3rds of the game... Thats sad to me. I tend to like longer campaigns.   Pros:  The Campaigns are fairly fun. their are some parts that can be a little tricky to figure out.  Great graphics. The sneak kill animations are awesome.   Cons: SO SHORT!!!! Story line is meh.
9430	0	a	This is a terrible game everytime i open it its like i am whatching some one â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on my face its soo bad it LAGS like crazy and has not as good game detail and iti is VERY, VERy, Veryyyyyyy LAGGYY... sucha bad game
9431	0	a	one of my biggest regret buy exellent campaign solo game ! but horrible multyplayer
9432	0	a	Horrible gameplay! Do not buy.
9433	0	a	why?
9434	0	a	Possibly the worst first person shooter ever.
9435	0	a	This game turned the terrifying aliens from Alien into mooks, each of them dumb as a brick and dispatched by a few bullets. 0/10 do not recommend. Voice acting is clammy, characters are one dimensional, and storyline is cliche in a bad way. Couldn't play more than an hour of the marine campaign before I started suffering from sudden projectile vomiting.
9436	0	a	This game is undeniably rubbish. This game doesnâ€™t bother with the two AVP movies and has its own story line. The game consists of 3 campaigns, which sounds like a good idea, unfortunately they take place on the same 5 levels. The marine campaign consists of a generic FPS experience, they seem to try to make the game scary for the first couple of levels and then just give up on that and throw it all out the window.  There are 67 audio logs that you can pick up and listen too, however if you are halfway through listening to one as you're playing through the story if a NPC makes any type of noise, the audio log will immediately stop playing, forcing you to start it from the beginning.   The predator campaign also starts off on a good note, it's what you'd expect from a Predator campaign, jungle level, stealth, stalking marines, but once again, for some unknown reason the developers decided that the predator would be better suited to walking around small grey corridors.  The Alien campaign is by far the worst, thanks to dodgy controls and a ridiculously short campaign, (I completed it under an hour on the hardest difficulty). The Alien latches onto every wall without you telling it too. There's a setting in the options menu that disables that problem, yet when you do disable it, it continues to do it anyway.  Overall the single player is pretty god awful.  MP: Well, the game has it's bog standard multiplayer modes, deathmatch, team deathmatch and a few lesser used modes. However there's no point talking about them because nobody plays them anyway.  Team Deathmatch is the only mode people play. You choose between a marine an alien or a predator, there's no difference at all from their single player counterparts.   Unfortunately there's some severe balancing issues. Thereâ€™s no point being anything other than the Predator for one reason, the plasma caster, impossible to dodge and will kill in 1-2 hits, if it doesn't kill you in the 1st shot, you'll be knocked over, unable to move and then they'll fire immediately to kill you again.  The stealth kill command is still in multiplayer, which just leads everybody trying to run behind your back and mashing the E key, because as long as the animation starts they get a kill. (Some cool animations though).  This game is filled with glitches and exploits, such as spawning out of the map, to instantly fall and die, no spawn protection so people often kill you as you spawn and the Aliens use an exploit to kill you nearly instantly.  Another thing this game does, you have to level up with an annoying EXP system (apparently every game needs this now. (I just hate it though)). The reward for leveling up isn't anything special and is indeed ridiculously pointless. You get skins for your character, on a first person game, Which obviously means you can't see them.  Overall, the game is pretty appalling, there's honestly no point in spending any money on this game and you are better off spending it on something else.
9437	0	a	The entire game was way too short. Especially when you consider it's file size. 9 gigs. 9 gigs of what? The graphics were pretty good for their time. But the game's very clunky and unrefined. It feels very rushed. I never even bothered with the Marine campaig. I DID have some fun playing as the Alien. It was challening enough to feel satisfying. Especially when you have to fight three predators. There was some nice attention to detail such as being able to see your 6 fingered limbs while you were climbing around. And the effect that the headbite had on enemies. But that campaign was also way too short and unrefined. Your goal seemed to be to return to the queen. And adding some more to that could've been interesting. But instead you move through levels with no idea what's really happening in the story and she suddenly gets killed and you replace her. Huh. Also it doesn't really make sense that the Alien should have health regeneration. Keeping the old mechanic of gibbing dead enemies for health would've worked fine here. It would've made the player more cautious, particularly on higher difficulties. And it also would've added some risky decison making when you were low on health and a possibly vulnerable enemy was nearby for you to replenish your health. It also would have made that final boss fight all the more satisfying once you were done with it. As for the Predator, the stealth's a nice touch I suppose. Same as it was in the 2001 AVP game. And you're not overpowered immediately playing as the predator as your healing and energy is limited. But the spear and smart disc made wading through areas filled with enemies a no brainer. Just switch between the two, heal occasionally and you're fine. That final boss fight was OK. Shame you can't really deal with it with melee like a proper predator might do (on higher difficulties that is) because of it's grab move and AOE attack. Back to the stealth though. The A.I are incredibly stupid. More so than they were back in 2001. They'll become alerted but won't really bother to pursue you. And it'll take them awhile to see you even when you're standing right in front of them. In AVP2 enemies would become alerted by this regardless of whether or not you were cloaked or not and regardless of difficulty iirc.
9438	0	a	The amount of positive reviews on this title is laughable. I spent about an hour playing and just started laughing my â™¥â™¥â™¥ off at how bad this game really is.. The maps are pretty lifeless. the rooms have nothing to look for and the path is very liner. It heavley relies on scripting every single event. nothing is a supprise. I didnt even feel like I was scared because I knew what was going to happen next and where the next enemy was going to come from. Now thats poor level design, and poor game mechanics. No feeling of being lost or not knowing where to go because your marker is always on the map and that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is always telling you what to do. Its a basic hand holding game that the develpers thought was a good idea. Im really disappointed in the amount of bad design decisions in this game. The ai is really bad to. The zenos dance back and forth like its trying to find the best path to you, they get stuck on walls, or will sit out in the open wait for you to shoot them....  Im sorry I cannot recommend this game, and anybody who actual does is lying to themselves, worst game ever played, hands down.
9439	0	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and isnt worth your money. Only decent AVP game is the original Alien Vs Predator 2 that was released years ago. This new games just god damn awful
9440	0	a	After the excellent AVP1 and AVP2 you would have thought another game in the series would have been a slamdunk.  You would be wrong.
9441	0	a	Too difficult...even on 'easy level.' You would expect a hard time at a higher level, but not this. I play to have fun, not get a headache. Save your time and money and buy something else.

9443	0	a	A pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, was highly anticipated the end product was just horrible. The graphics were bad, the gameplay felt rough, the campaign was boring and the multiplayer was unbalanced, do not recommend.
9444	0	a	looks nice,plays rubbish
9445	0	a	Absolutely dreadful. I picked this up with fond memories of AVP 1 and 2. Imagine visiting your grandfather's grave one quiet Sunday afternoon with some nice flowers to lay down only to find some youths have taken a poop there and kicked over the gravel - that's the feeling I had as I tried to comprehend the mess that this game presented.   Avoid.
9446	0	a	 https://hardcoregames.azurewebsites.net/?p=7801   The campaigns are short but you can play it as the Colonian marine, Alien or as the Predator.  This game has been not well received and due to the short campaign its not worth it.
9447	0	a	What is this? The Good part is the preditor campain Is BADASS u can clok and other stuff the alien one is cool when u run away with your bro the marine is hard u start with a pistol that dos barly any damge the best gun is the minigun and the flameftogher now lets go on the bad bits WHAT is point of haveing muiltiplayer WHERE I CANRT CONNECT TO A SINGLE MATCH! AND dont tell me that i need to buy SOMETHING IF U DO GIVE ME MONEY! THis is A terrble game for muiltiplayer if u buy THIS GAME AND CANRT CONNET TO A SINGLE MATCH ITS NOT WORTH UR MONEY! THIS IS A 3/10

9449	0	a	waste of money
9450	0	a	Sh it game from 90th. graphics from 90, gameplay like doom1 yes 2D doom1!!! even quake2 has better graphic and gameplay. I would never recommend that crap.  1 / 10. Total crap.
9451	0	a	Do. Not. Buy. This. Game.
9452	0	a	Tried to play a few times but shooting mechanics are bad, it doesn't feel right. Story sucks. Graphics are ok. If you have limited time for gaming, shoud consider other options.
9453	0	a	The original AVP was great, had a lot of scary moments and aliens were legitimately scary as they came in countless numbers. This re-imagining of the AVP turns it on its head a bit and makes aliens more durable, less frequent and altogether un-scary.  On a positive note, it looks great and controls well for the most part. Fans of Aliens will enjoy some tie-ins and cameo(s) to the series.  AVP 2 felt like the series at its peak.
9454	0	a	This version of AVP is similar to the 1999 version, but its not as good sadly, the presentation is great but the warped screen effect for the Alien is disorienting and distracting. The weapons are not balanced well and the single player missions are too short. It's a fun distraction but not a solid title.
9455	0	a	I remember playing the demo for this game, and it was amazing! I saw it available during a summer sale and didn't even hesitate to buy it. Upon installing I realized that it was not the game I thought it was. The only reason I have 3 hours on record is because I FORCED myself to beat one of the campaigns.
9456	0	a	As a single player fps it's mostly ok, considering the fact that all three of the characters' campaigns can be finished in one afternoon. That's at least consistent with the earlier avp games. The redeeming factor, however, was to be the multiplayer. Now in the first two games, the multiplayer was awesome. That doesn't happen here. Here Are a few reasons why that is.  -The characters are sluggish and stiff . -The quicktime kills are still present and spamable. -There is no visible ballance between the playable races . -The several maps present in the vanilla game are all absurdly boring and similar in design. -When playing the alien or predator the impact of your attacks is barely noticeable, meaning that you can't always tell if you're doing damage or not.  -Even when your attacks connect with the enemy, your screen is constantly blurred by smudges of blood making gameplay severely disorienting in a bad way. -The gamemodes are standard and therefore unimaginative.  -Survival mode is a slap in the face to anyone eager to experience the thrills of an Aliens movie, because you're stuck in a 5x5 room at all times. Did i mention it's an ugly little room? -Numerous exploitable glitches. -A barely existent community. Several dedicated servers with the same TDM, DM, MDM modes active. You're better off hosting your own.   All in all, for the sake of the single player AND if you're a fan, get it on sale. And by 'sale' i mean 5$ or less.
9457	0	a	It's the worst game ever, I rather play Maple Story.
9458	0	a	Got this to play co-op with my husband. Unfortunately, the co-op in this game is severely underdeveloped. Might be fun otherwise, but I can't recommend it.
9459	0	a	Played this for few hours. Then leave it. No single interest anymore. Dont buy.
9460	0	a	I remember when the Predator was over powered and the aliens were the main enemy and the marines were just there. Now the Predator is weakened and a marine can just shove you on the ground even though that's basically the same thing as a man throwing a lion to the ground. The online is fun until you realize how much needs improving. Every character has something to counter the other except..the predator. His gadgets can only do so much with everyone killing you with a one-shot shotgun blast I mean really who wants to play Aliens vs Predator just to play as the Marine grunts. Now that is 75% of the remaining players. Out of a 18 player lobby you'll find 5 Predators. 10 Marines, and just 3 Aliens. This game was fun when it came out because of diversity but it's just a shell of what it was. It needs to be re-visited but Rebellion won't make another avp for a long time so enjoy the last remnants of a dying franchise Overall 5/10 &gt;The campaign is fun but very short and two hours with each character is barely a game &gt;Online activity is dead except for a few people maybe like 50 in total &gt;One shot kill marines are generally the hackers in the game. One shot pistols are lovely They should re-name the game to Marines vs the world...
9461	0	a	I love the Predator and Aliens genre, and have played different games featuring them before like the old Predator vs Aliens game which was great. However, I did not like this new Predator vs Aliens game. It was too hard, the controls were clunky, and the nature of the characters were different from the movies.   Take the Predator for example...... there were lots of different buttons and controls to remember and use, and during the heat of battle, I often found myself hitting the wrong keys or forgetting what keys to press in which order. The Predator was also different than in the movies - the cloaking device would automatically turn off as soon as I attacked someone, allowing other enemies to see me, and the shoulder canon could only fire a couple of shots before needing to be recharged, plus there were only 2 vision modes which were human sight and infra-red despite the movie Predators having numerous vision modes. It seemed as though they made the Predator weaker in the game to balance out the alien and marine. And with the tasks to be completed to progress through the game, all too often they were not clearly marked or apparent.  The earlier Predator vs Aliens was better with an easier control system, and smoother fighting system. Plus I missed the ability to make the Predator roar to scare the enemy! Not a good game in my opinion.
9462	0	a	This game could be one of the most disapointing games of all time. Do not get.   The only fun part was the multiplayer but its completely dead now.
9463	0	a	Campaigns are alright-ish but short and mostly unsatisfying, ending shortly after something actually starts happening. Survival mode is a joke (only marine, only 2 maps). Multiplayer seemed to be fun in pre-release demo but now it's dead. It's not the game I dreamt of and was hyped for as AVP fan. I don't recommend getting it unless it's on a big sale (which was the case for me, and thus at least I don't regret my purchase).
9464	0	a	A solid game mechanichs-wise, but story-wise very lacking. But That is not the focus of the game, multiplayer is. In this case your mileage may vary, the best thing about it is the 3 different gameplay styles for every playable race, but the game overall lacks depth. As a result I got bored with the game rather quickly, so unless you can play for days aganist other players, honing your abilities, even if the game offers very little beyond that, it is a solid, but not outstanding title. Otherwise, it's only fun for a couple of hours.
9465	0	a	I regret spending the paltry sum i did on what i can only describe as an enormous steaming pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that is this game. Do not commit the same folly as i.. Do not purchase this game.. Have some dignity, take it from a man who lost his.
9466	0	a	Not worth a full RRP. Its enjoyable for what it is but the Alien Campaign was completed in an hour and a half with very little difficulty. The Mahrine and Predahtor Campaigns are a little more lengthy, starting at different points but theres very little 'cross over relevance' other than you shoot one or two of the other.  Get it on the cheap Â£5 or less.
9467	0	a	Pretty balls game, good to muck around in but there is no replay value. Score 5/10.
9468	0	a	:| why...
9469	0	a	Dont buy this game its really an huge waste of money...
9470	0	a	Tried to play a few times but shooting mechanics are bad, it doesn't feel right. Story sucks. Graphics are ok. If you have limited time for gaming, shoud consider other options.
9471	0	a	Fairly well put together on a technical level. But also just ungodly boring as a game. Go with the earlier entries in the series if you haven't played them.
9472	0	a	The very definition of a bad port and poor adaptation. Avoid.
9473	0	a	I remember playing the demo for this game, and it was amazing! I saw it available during a summer sale and didn't even hesitate to buy it. Upon installing I realized that it was not the game I thought it was. The only reason I have 3 hours on record is because I FORCED myself to beat one of the campaigns.
9474	0	a	As a single player fps it's mostly ok, considering the fact that all three of the characters' campaigns can be finished in one afternoon. That's at least consistent with the earlier avp games. The redeeming factor, however, was to be the multiplayer. Now in the first two games, the multiplayer was awesome. That doesn't happen here. Here Are a few reasons why that is.  -The characters are sluggish and stiff . -The quicktime kills are still present and spamable. -There is no visible ballance between the playable races . -The several maps present in the vanilla game are all absurdly boring and similar in design. -When playing the alien or predator the impact of your attacks is barely noticeable, meaning that you can't always tell if you're doing damage or not.  -Even when your attacks connect with the enemy, your screen is constantly blurred by smudges of blood making gameplay severely disorienting in a bad way. -The gamemodes are standard and therefore unimaginative.  -Survival mode is a slap in the face to anyone eager to experience the thrills of an Aliens movie, because you're stuck in a 5x5 room at all times. Did i mention it's an ugly little room? -Numerous exploitable glitches. -A barely existent community. Several dedicated servers with the same TDM, DM, MDM modes active. You're better off hosting your own.   All in all, for the sake of the single player AND if you're a fan, get it on sale. And by 'sale' i mean 5$ or less.
9475	0	a	Graphics are actually really good. That is about it.  There was no multiplayer to speak of because nobody wanted to buy an unhyped video game that was poorly coded.   There were many glitches and exploits for insta wins if you wanted to.  Multiplayer when you could play was a joke.   The pros of the game were that there was lots of content, for all 3 classes. Even though they play through the same map they all take different pathways.   Expert mode is a challenge and I like challenging - dynamically fun - games. AVP is definitely a changing beast because you can find new ways to exploit your PVE content.  I'd rate this 4/10  Only worth $7.50-$10 if you can catch it on sale. There won't be anyone online most likely but the solo game is worth that much.
9476	0	a	The new AVP is bad. I was a huge fan of the first AVP from 2000 and its sequel but the new one is amazingly flawed in its execution.  The only way to really kill anything is with a headshot and the AI is psychic and knows exactly where you are aiming even if it has its back turned to you so for the Space Marines the only effective way to kill anything is to pistol whip it and shoot it in the head as it staggers. This makes combat as the marines rather dull as the game sends hordes of mobs against you at a time giving you two options. Try and fight them properly and run out of ammo or be easily over run or Pistol whip, shoot in head and live.  The map design is also terrible. Each map ends in the exact same way. Wait for the elevator and fight off the swarm. Every freakin' level.  As for atmosphere as the Marines the game is has a great deal of suspense until you discover the entirety of the games combat involves circle strafing and pistol whipping at which point it becomes a farce.
9477	0	a	Loved AVP 2 hated this abortion of a game. Where to begin.... Well Graphically it's pretty darn good! So there's that. Other than that the story is pretty over-done. The levels are bland. The control scheme is complete crap and the online play is practically non-existant. I loved going online in AVP 2 and seeing dozens of games availabe for me to hop in to. This game has zero online play, which is too bad because with the crappiness of single player; A multiplayer could have really saved this game. Overall I give it 2/10 and that's being generous. Save your cash and buy any number of superior games available with the summer sale.
9478	0	a	It's an ok game.   The first person fistfighting, which isn't great, is forced prominently into the spotlight. Most painful are the 'trophy' and 'stealth' kills which are very slow. They might look cool before you've seen each for the tenth time time but they also disrupt gameplay and tend to allow for the enemy to gently remind you of their presence with bullets and claw whilst you , ignoring injury, recite hamlet.  The writing itself is average and i failed to see what was so amazing about bishop from the movies returning (other than the wasted budget). The marine versus android battles in the late game were awful and the three races have this absurd amount of durability to compensate for how slow they are.   There are some things that are good; the multiplayer could be pretty scary if you were playing marine. The sound and atmosphere of some of the earlier levels were of high quality. The AI is better than expected (although worse than what could be hoped for) and some of the fights were both intense and fun. The game just doesn't feel polished enough and the slower pace of the game doesn't work well in comparison to the faster AVP games from over half a decade ago.    Recomendation: if you want a better AVP game; Try AVP gold or , even better, try 'AVP2'. It was made by monolith, the guys who made the first fear games.
9479	0	a	Not great
9480	0	a	Not bad, not good, just very bland.
9481	0	a	A 30gb load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9482	0	a	Fun yet broken . i want to recomend it but it does have serious issues and the servers suck ( because of playerbase) therefore your gonna have to play with freinds ( with is fine) and everything needs to be balanced.
9483	0	a	Horrid game, they should of just remade AVP2
9484	0	a	This has to be one of the most irratating FPS I have played.  I try to enjoy this game but OMG it is as if the dev team made this awesome world then turned out most of the lights. You can only see crap and that makes most everything black to the aliens are basically black on black. Also, the pulse rifle is way undered powered from the movie, and WHY is that?? So they can introduce some non canon weapons for you to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with. Overall, this MODERN FPS fails. To bad most modern shooters suffer from the same flaws.
9485	0	a	Singleplayer was good (if you can stand the glitches). Multiplayer was awesome for the month or so that you could actually connect. Overall, I'd say don't get it unless it goes on steam sale for $3.00 or less. A dollar a campaign.
9486	0	a	a huge disappointment.  You can play aliens, predators and humans but all three have extremely under-developed gameplay mechanics. The campaigns are short and boring, the story is dreadful and overall it's dull, unpolished, clunky and... feels old. Don't buy.
9487	0	a	Im getting dizzy playing this, literally. Something with graphics
9488	0	a	Do. Not. Buy. This. Game.
9489	0	a	It's published by Activision. So every purchase adds money into R.K.'s wallet - which is a bad carma.
9490	0	a	bof je la i acheter pas chere!
9491	0	a	Sorry to say that AvP was a waste of money then only redeeming feature of this game was the multiplayer mode. The story line in the Single Player Campaign seems like it was rushed and thrown together last minute. I bought this game when it was first released and the price was too much (I realised this after I got the game) sorry SEGA &amp; Rebellion better luck with your other games
9492	0	a	The original AVP was great, had a lot of scary moments and aliens were legitimately scary as they came in countless numbers. This re-imagining of the AVP turns it on its head a bit and makes aliens more durable, less frequent and altogether un-scary.  On a positive note, it looks great and controls well for the most part. Fans of Aliens will enjoy some tie-ins and cameo(s) to the series.  AVP 2 felt like the series at its peak.
9493	0	a	This version of AVP is similar to the 1999 version, but its not as good sadly, the presentation is great but the warped screen effect for the Alien is disorienting and distracting. The weapons are not balanced well and the single player missions are too short. It's a fun distraction but not a solid title.
9494	0	a	It's good for a play through. But not worth investing any time into and even the $2.99 price tag(steam sale) is probably to much to pay for it..  Rebellion (A horrible development studio that sues other companies that use the word Rebellion in any part of their title/sub title) made alot of promises about this game that we're never brought to light.  Support for the game was cut off completly about 2 or 3 months after release and many* of the bugs/exploits still exsist to this day.  -PROS- Alien and Predator instant kill animations are absolutly awesome. Alien and Predator Story are not to bad. You can chase your own tail as the alien. :3 Animations are good and sound is ok. Most of the hackers/cheaters have quit playing in multiplayer by this point.  -CONS- Bugs/exploits will never be fixed. Marines voice overs are repeated nearly constantly (get used to hearing 'Don't relax just yet marines'). AI is about as smart as a toaster. Marines apparently can only jump 1 foot off the ground. Multiplayer is all but empty only a few populated servers left. Alien/predators play rock-paper-scissors in melee combat and predator basically all but always wins. Humans can block and kind of play the rock-paper-scissors thing but basically always end up being cannon fodder for the other 2 races to play with. (this could be a PRO really as IMO in the battle between the 3 races we are certainly at the bottom of the food chain) Alien/predators can easily get stuck in conga-lines of instant kills which is rather funny to watch in multiplayer. There were DLC map packs released for the game that almost no one purchased which still seperated the player base. ZERO support of any kind for Mods, maps, patchs etc etc as the game has been fully abandoned by Rebellion.  I have a good amount of hours put into this game because I was hosting a server at its launch. I can not recommend this game but If your going to get it make sure it's dirt cheap or someone actually pays you to take it...
9495	0	a	Well, it's better than Aliens: Colonial Marines... but I guess that's not saying much.  The good: - Some tense moments spread throughout each campaign - Overall good atmosphere, thanks to the sound design and environments (DX11 enabled) - Playing as the predator really captures that bad-â™¥â™¥â™¥ hunter vibe - A few of the execution kills are very grusome and satisfying  The Bad: - Terrible characters and dialogue, most notably in the Marine campaign - Re-use of many of the same environments for each race's campaign - Shoddy weapon and combat mechanics (e.g. Alien or Predator melee) - Enemy AI is often laughable and tends to weaken player immersion - As per above, a few of the final/boss fights are terribly designed  The Score: 6/10  If you're a hardcore fan of Aliens and/or Predator, give this game a try for a sale price. Otherwise, to the majority gamers, this game is mediocre at best and your time could be better spent elsewhere.  [Review based on single-player only.]
9496	0	a	Im really bumed. like the predator campain.Why do you decloak when you hit something.Also the sounds what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.The alien hisss sound come on it sounds like a bear growling.I recomend mods to make it better but somethings cant be fixed.
9497	0	a	Overpriced, even at 9.99 on special
9498	0	a	Kind of a let down to verterans of AvP games. Better graphics...but as far as weapon variety and story depth, the old AvP games were FAR superior.
9499	0	a	Nothing like the original.
9500	0	a	40 of those hours was waiting in lobbies â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this 'game'
9501	0	a	Campaigns are alright-ish but short and mostly unsatisfying, ending shortly after something actually starts happening. Survival mode is a joke (only marine, only 2 maps). Multiplayer seemed to be fun in pre-release demo but now it's dead. It's not the game I dreamt of and was hyped for as AVP fan. I don't recommend getting it unless it's on a big sale (which was the case for me, and thus at least I don't regret my purchase).
9502	0	a	This game has unacceptable flaws that will drive Aliens fans insane. The smartgun does not make the iconic sound from the movie, it just sounds like an m-60 (which would be awesome if it was an M60). The flame thrower looks ridiculous, like something from a clowns arsenal, if clowns had arsenals (they didn't use the model from Alien or Aliens). Those two things really bugged me...especially the sound of the smartgun...ugh...At least the pulse rifle had the correct sound, although it was made to look way bigger than it should have. During one cut scene a female Hispanic marine named 'Tequila' (really?) is holding one and it looks like she is weilding King Cong's member. No iron sights, every battle degrades into swinging the crosshair around firing in every direction. Once you get further in to the game and more experienced you can almost aim, but not really. The pulse rifle is really under powered too. I mean obviously it shouldn't be EASY to kill a xeno but it takes like 30 rounds unless you hit their head by pure luck (see no aiming). The smartgun issue is kind of solved by it not really being accessable..it only really shows up when they have a special part of the game setup specifically for the smartgun. I usually just avoided it because it ran out of ammo so quickly and sounded like a chorus of dead babies. I beat it as the marine just so I could say I didn't totally waste my money, it took 4.2 hours. Oh, I almost forgot, and this is the worst, the marine campaign begins with 'oops, got knocked out and your squad took your assault rifle and left you for dead!!! lololololol'. No, we are past this, the days of starting with a pistol are over (unless you played the first Halo, which I did up until I was handed an unloaded pistol and promptly p*ssed on my friends x-box and jumped out the window).   I played the Alien for a short time but got sick of getting stuck when transitioning from wall to ceiling and the game generally sucking....didn't try the predator, I wouldn't do that to him, in my mind his campaign will always be awesome, and I'm just not interested in this game anymore.   If you are looking for an AVP game buy the classic 2000. I am surprised at how positive the reviews are on here....Did everyone else get a bottle of whiskey and a horse tranquilizer with their copy?
9503	0	a	This game is like the AVP movies, (i mean, it amazes my brains how a movie about Aliens against Predator is boring... relentless creatures with acid for blood versus the ultimate space hunter of the universe, how can you make that mediocre? just add some dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥ gringo movie plot instead of science fiction and voilÃ¡)   But I guess if you liked those flicks maybe you would like this game... the story is about a Bishop android being the boss in Weyland Yutani and openning a Predators ancient temple type of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ of the universe, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happens cuz humans still dont learn that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing with xenomorphs is a bad idea, predators are watching from space, the planet is their playground, the story is shared but not mixed directly between the 3 characters. As you advance in the game storyline you will find many clichÃ© â™¥â™¥â™¥ predictable â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ including the ending.  The gameplay for the marine is crap, he cant crouch, the smart gun is a new model but feels horrible, actually most of the guns are lame, weapons iconic sounds are missed, a thing about the marine, he has no name, they just call him the rookie, and he never talks.... wtf, they try to do the bonding â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like in Half Life with Gordon Freeman but they failed, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the rookie. And he cant crouch.  The alien gameplay is kinda cool tho, it can be really fast and you get to execute victims or holding them to get facehugged (the bad of the good part: the alien design is like the ones on the Alien: Resurrection movie, with chicken legs and funny hands) the predator is not that bad, but as he have many weapons to operate sometimes dealing with enemies is like slow and dull, changing vision modes should have been more dinamic too.  Multiplayer, at this point is dead, you must be really lucky to find a game with decent number of people to make the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fun.  I remember the old AVP games, they were so good, the first one was even scary but my fav was the second one and its expansion, good times and decent story like in the comic books, the first one is here on Steam so buy it and avoid this unless is in a special cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥ deal or something   4/10 mediocre, could be worst... like Aliens: Colonial Marines
9504	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES now usually i dont listen to neggative reviews but seriously  i usually loom at the good's of a game and here is the only good thing the movement and some of the abilties Campaign is interesting BUT Multiplayer is heavily unbalanced and they are not planning to do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this game because  it is related to sega (i knew it was destined for the sewers) Aliens are extremly weak and useless dont play as them Marines shotguns will one shot you even if you hit them they dont care and predators..... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ those guys they just jump around and knock you down and then double heavy attack you because you CANT DO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ BECAUSE YOU ARE KNOCKED DOWN OH BOO HOO  seriously this game is the worst i really dont think you should buy it even on sale
9505	0	a	I would not reccomend this game if you plan to play online with it, the story is nice tough but the online sucks, teams are unbalanced and the predator is to overpowerd having all that is needed to withstand a 10 v 1 situation and most of the time it is only predators.
9506	0	a	After getting an upgraded system and MUCH better graphics card, I was excited to get this on the Steam summer sale. However, I constantly faced crashe after crash! I have to power off my computer as it CAD doesn't work. I droped the graphics down to bare minimum thinking it would help but it didn't.   Googled my problem and none of the resolutions worked. Giving up on it.
9507	0	a	Could of been better
9508	0	a	hi this is guy who died next to the generators PDA. i died. next to the generator. turn it on 3/10
9509	0	a	The storyline is short and not quite broad. Wanted to drown deep into this world, but that didn't happen. ;(
9510	0	a	3 times the terrible - don't buy this game. Better off buying AVP classic 2000 for your Predator needs.
9511	0	a	I would recommend this game so much for its single player but the multiplayer is now so full of hackers, the purpose of buying this game is gone. Buy it only for single player, not for multi player.
9512	0	a	Only buy if it is less than a fiver.  Shoddy game which does not do it's original, or AvP2 any justice.
9513	0	a	I can not recommend this game.. simply its crap.. SP is short and boring, MP is crappy, unbalanced like hell and boring because of only several maps..  rly bad game...
9514	0	a	Not bad, not good, just very bland.
9515	0	a	Singleplayer was short and nothing special. The alien campaign had an interesting premise, but quickly got boring like the others.  Multiplayer is terrible, takes ages to find a lobby and most of the time it won't find one at all.  Trophy kill system is broken and the overall experience has been dumbed down a lot since AVP2. For example, barely any maps are included, classes have been removed and replaced with purely aesthetic skin changing.
9516	0	a	This has to be one of the most irratating FPS I have played.  I try to enjoy this game but OMG it is as if the dev team made this awesome world then turned out most of the lights.

9517	0	a	A mediocre follow-up to the Rebellion's original AvP and Monolith's AvP2.  The interaction/movement fluidity is abrupt and clunky (especially for the Alien), the levels are tiny and claustrophobic (this does not include levels that are MEANT to be claustrophobic for the sake tension and ambiance) and a storyline and script that pales in comparison to it's predecessor.  The game is without technical issues or bugs (as far as I can tell) so if you are interested in giving this game a try despite its shortcomings you should have no issues running it.  Overall a game that placed visuals above gameplay.  Keeping my fingers crossed that AvP2 and Primal Hunt make it to Steam.
9518	0	a	Playing as a xenomorph is the best part about this game. You actually feel like you are hunting, and you have to really plan out your approach or you can get wasted. Playing as a predator is kind of weak in this game. I really didn't feel powerful, and the prey stalking was kind of weak. The rest of the game was boring. For the extremely short portion of the game in which you are a xenomorph, its fun. But, thats like an hour. The human portion is half the game, so thats 3 hours. The predator and and cenomorph sections take up about an hour and a half each. I had fun overall, but I can't recommend it as an Aliens game. Really weak.
9519	0	a	Not as bad as Colonial Marines, but not far from it...
9520	0	a	play avp 2 instead.
9521	0	a	I would recommend this if it wasn't so damn buggy and crashed so much. Play if you want to lose your progress, repeatedly.
9522	0	a	You can not crouch in this game nor go prone :(
9523	0	a	Great graphics. Clunky consolised controls, poor MP game balance, watered down console-tard storyline. Not even for fans of the Aliens, Predator and/or AvP franchises, unless very very cheap.
9524	0	a	The idea of the multi-player is wonderful. Execution? Poor. Alien and Predator Species are overpowered and dominate in all matches unless Marines work together. Such a shame, it had much potential.
9525	0	a	Do not buy this game unless you are desperately in need of some Alien vs. Predator vs. Marine action. The game's controls and experiences are a more than a little wonky, and you will find that not many play this game even two years after release. The handful of dedicated players seem to have this game on lockdown, so you probably won't enjoy it much unless you enjoy dying -- frequently.
9526	0	a	This game has hollywood level sound effects and visuals, sadly the gameplay is not what i had hoped for. You cannot crouch, you cannot reload while running, i feel like a mannequin trying to fight aliens. Even the predator feels limited in what he could do from the previous games. In order to kill someone in multiplayer as alien or predator all you need to do is run up behind them and press E. Multplayer is also virtually dead.
9527	0	a	A 30gb load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9528	0	a	Horrid game, they should of just remade AVP2
9529	0	a	Still better than Colonial Marine.
9530	0	a	In space no one can hear this game suck. I am not sure how anyone can screw up this great concept, but this developer found a way.  3/10
9531	0	a	Fun yet broken . i want to recomend it but it does have serious issues and the servers suck ( because of playerbase) therefore your gonna have to play with freinds ( with is fine) and everything needs to be balanced.
9532	0	a	Singleplayer was good (if you can stand the glitches). Multiplayer was awesome for the month or so that you could actually connect. Overall, I'd say don't get it unless it goes on steam sale for $3.00 or less. A dollar a campaign.
9533	0	a	Great game love it! However they must have stopped supporting it would not recommend to get for multiplayer. Way to many hackers. Apparently now you can one hit people with a light attack and their heavy attack takes half a second to do. Some people have it so no matter where they are standing they can E kill you. Also, blocking doesn't do anything in multiplayer anymore either u can be knocked down by light attacks so. DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY. (Unless you're getting it for single player)
9534	0	a	I just want to say, I liked the Alien franchise a lot better before I started noticing the sexual overtones. The Alien finishing moves in this game crank it up to 11. It's weird.  Besides that, it's just all around not a very good game.
9535	0	a	It's an ok game.   The first person fistfighting, which isn't great, is forced prominently into the spotlight. Most painful are the 'trophy' and 'stealth' kills which are very slow.

9542	0	a	Only buy if it is less than a fiver.  Shoddy game which does not do it's original, or AvP2 any justice.
9543	0	a	THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WALLS! ...Oh, that's a clipping bug. Wow. This... this is not a good game.
9544	0	a	can u make one good game please the genre deserves at least that
9545	0	a	This has to be one of the most irratating FPS I have played.  I try to enjoy this game but OMG it is as if the dev team made this awesome world then turned out most of the lights. You can only see crap and that makes most everything black to the aliens are basically black on black. Also, the pulse rifle is way undered powered from the movie, and WHY is that?? So they can introduce some non canon weapons for you to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with. Overall, this MODERN FPS fails. To bad most modern shooters suffer from the same flaws.
9546	0	a	Singleplayer was short and nothing special. The alien campaign had an interesting premise, but quickly got boring like the others.  Multiplayer is terrible, takes ages to find a lobby and most of the time it won't find one at all.  Trophy kill system is broken and the overall experience has been dumbed down a lot since AVP2. For example, barely any maps are included, classes have been removed and replaced with purely aesthetic skin changing.
9547	0	a	Don't get this. It is a mockery of what the previous two games were.
9548	0	a	one of my favourites games but with a lot of bugs which ruin the game
9549	0	a	Wow...... this game is so bad. BAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
9550	0	a	Very fun for a short while. So-so FPS overall. I don't recommend it too much. Very generic.
9551	0	a	It's the worst game ever, I rather play Maple Story.
9552	0	a	Didn't like it, all the power that you are supposed to feel goes away when someone blocks your claws (alien or predator) with his gun... The old Alien vs predator is way better.
9553	0	a	Terrible. AvP is predictable in every account - something that would excusable if it were predictably good. However, AvP is far from it. Stylistically, it is drab and dull, stunningly unimaginative. With regards to gameplay, I'm unsure that I have played a more generic fps. And finally, as icing to the cake, aesthetically, it lacks any sense of appeal. AvP is simple, boring, and ultimately, fails to capture any interest in ANY of its features. TL:DR = No. No, no, no, no. NO. Avoid this pathetic excuse of what I am ashamed to call a video game.
9554	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!   Steam has the master servers rigged so that only servers in Russia show up. I have put in a ticket a while ago and they have still failed to respond.   I have been running AVP servers since this game came out and they no longer show in the server browser even though it says connected to steam in the console window. All my other steam game servers show in the browsers, WTF is up with this one steam!?
9555	0	a	I remember when the Predator was over powered and the aliens were the main enemy and the marines were just there. Now the Predator is weakened and a marine can just shove you on the ground even though that's basically the same thing as a man throwing a lion to the ground. The online is fun until you realize how much needs improving. Every character has something to counter the other except..the predator. His gadgets can only do so much with everyone killing you with a one-shot shotgun blast I mean really who wants to play Aliens vs Predator just to play as the Marine grunts. Now that is 75% of the remaining players. Out of a 18 player lobby you'll find 5 Predators. 10 Marines, and just 3 Aliens. This game was fun when it came out because of diversity but it's just a shell of what it was. It needs to be re-visited but Rebellion won't make another avp for a long time so enjoy the last remnants of a dying franchise Overall 5/10 &gt;The campaign is fun but very short and two hours with each character is barely a game &gt;Online activity is dead except for a few people maybe like 50 in total &gt;One shot kill marines are generally the hackers in the game. One shot pistols are lovely They should re-name the game to Marines vs the world...
9556	0	a	just not enough content sorry its worth buying for like 5 bucks someday when its on sale but dont waste your money with anything higher than that. They just did not come through with the plotline for the alien. its fun to play the predator but for some reason the AI od predator vs alien games always sucks i mean half life back in 1996 had better AI seriously. its worth buying for a bit, but it could have been so much better.
9557	0	a	You can not crouch in this game nor go prone :(
9558	0	a	A 30gb load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9559	0	a	In space no one can hear this game suck. I am not sure how anyone can screw up this great concept, but this developer found a way.  3/10
9560	0	a	Great graphics. Clunky consolised controls, poor MP game balance, watered down console-tard storyline. Not even for fans of the Aliens, Predator and/or AvP franchises, unless very very cheap.
9561	0	a	The idea of the multi-player is wonderful. Execution? Poor. Alien and Predator Species are overpowered and dominate in all matches unless Marines work together. Such a shame, it had much potential.
9562	0	a	Singleplayer was good (if you can stand the glitches). Multiplayer was awesome for the month or so that you could actually connect. Overall, I'd say don't get it unless it goes on steam sale for $3.00 or less. A dollar a campaign.
9563	0	a	Do not buy this game unless you are desperately in need of some Alien vs. Predator vs. Marine action. The game's controls and experiences are a more than a little wonky, and you will find that not many play this game even two years after release. The handful of dedicated players seem to have this game on lockdown, so you probably won't enjoy it much unless you enjoy dying -- frequently.
9564	0	a	This game has hollywood level sound effects and visuals, sadly the gameplay is not what i had hoped for. You cannot crouch, you cannot reload while running, i feel like a mannequin trying to fight aliens. Even the predator feels limited in what he could do from the previous games. In order to kill someone in multiplayer as alien or predator all you need to do is run up behind them and press E. Multplayer is also virtually dead.
9565	0	a	It's an ok game.   The first person fistfighting, which isn't great, is forced prominently into the spotlight. Most painful are the 'trophy' and 'stealth' kills which are very slow. They might look cool before you've seen each for the tenth time time but they also disrupt gameplay and tend to allow for the enemy to gently remind you of their presence with bullets and claw whilst you , ignoring injury, recite hamlet.  The writing itself is average and i failed to see what was so amazing about bishop from the movies returning (other than the wasted budget). The marine versus android battles in the late game were awful and the three races have this absurd amount of durability to compensate for how slow they are.   There are some things that are good; the multiplayer could be pretty scary if you were playing marine. The sound and atmosphere of some of the earlier levels were of high quality. The AI is better than expected (although worse than what could be hoped for) and some of the fights were both intense and fun. The game just doesn't feel polished enough and the slower pace of the game doesn't work well in comparison to the faster AVP games from over half a decade ago.    Recomendation: if you want a better AVP game; Try AVP gold or , even better, try 'AVP2'. It was made by monolith, the guys who made the first fear games.
9566	0	a	a huge disappointment.  You can play aliens, predators and humans but all three have extremely under-developed gameplay mechanics. The campaigns are short and boring, the story is dreadful and overall it's dull, unpolished, clunky and... feels old. Don't buy.
9567	0	a	A game that could've been decent at some point, isn't anymore. With the now abandoned multiplayer, and disappointing single player, this game is totally useless after a few hours of fun.
9568	0	a	Better than the movie. Not better than Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, Predator, Predator 2, or Predators. Okay, it's not better than AVP either, but it is a little better than AVP 2.
9569	0	a	Pretty balls game, good to muck around in but there is no replay value. Score 5/10.
9570	0	a	Never completed it...  Story is not compelling.. Game play is OK, nothing ground breaking.  Can't really see the point, the Original was so much better.  'Oh Jesus, Oh god, oh god, oh god'
9571	0	a	Fairly well put together on a technical level. But also just ungodly boring as a game. Go with the earlier entries in the series if you haven't played them.
9572	0	a	AvP is very mediocre. It's a shame because Aliens and Predators are two of the coolest monsters around. So much more could have been done with them. The Marine campaign is the best, then the Predator, and the Aliens campaign was most disappointing. All three campaigns take place around the same events, just from different perspectives. That's partially cool, but also partially lazy, because all the same locations get reused for different campaigns. I wasn't bored playing the game, but given the source material, it could have been much, much better. Multiplayer is dead.
9573	0	a	Campaign is pretty rad, but the multiplayer is disappointing as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, especially compared to the incredible Alien vs Predator 2 of 1999. 1 to 1 to 1 balance and too much focus on cutscene 'stealth' kills makes it pretty stupid. Get it on sale.
9574	0	a	I first played and finished this AVP on PS3 (even got Platinum trophy) and I was disappointed. At least, I was able to trade it but still, that game was very disappointing on many aspects not respected from previous AVP games. Instead of using the things that worked so good on previous AVP games, this AVP 2010 simply decided to discard many aspects that was amazing on older AVP games and shove you that lack-luster product that's more related to the pathetic AVP movies than the previous games that were closer to the Aliens, Predator 1&amp;2 movies. A huge step backwards and I hope, IF there's another AVP in the future, that it'll be made by a competent developer studio or get back with Monolith who did it perfectly on their AVP 2. Rebellion did a sloppy job on this game.  PROS: +The graphics are truly amazing, especially this PC version. +Faster Alien speed than previous AVP games.  +Lance Henriksen (Bishop) and William Hope (Lt. Gorman) from ALIENS voice cast. +Multi Player fun when played with friends. +Trophy kills are quite cool (at first). +Gore is well done. +Great character/monster modelling  +No flashy orange WY uniform  +No cartoon-ish visuals in this game unlike AVP 2.  CONS: -Uninspiring level design. -Weak narrative and story. -No Rich Ragdale or similar sounding soundtrack (Made AVP 1999 or AVP Classic soundtrack). -Majority of in game sounds are used from the AVP movies instead of the original AVP games and/or original movies  -Many scripted sequences during campaign mode. -Lack of controls in this game (no crouching, no leaning, no aiming). -Lame contextual situations (Sequential auto-kill (Insta-Kill)) are badly implemented, makes you vulnerable during that action phase. Worse is its in effect for the MP as well. -Multi Player mode takes very long to join a game. -NO DEDICATED SERVERS for the PC versions. It was promised then discarded just before game launch  -Lack of MP maps (unless you fork your hard earned $ for the purchasable Map packs DLC). -Same single player maps for all three species  -Weak A.I. (One of the badder I have ever seen in a game). -Predator HUD is well crafted and feels refreshing BUT, the health and energy gauges are poor represented and even confusing. It was better made from AVP 1999 with the red and blue predator symbols on each side.  -Indestructible Sentry Guns (you can only power them down by smashing a nearby computer keyboard); and the sound used is poorly done, not the same used in the Aliens movie.  OVERALL: The Multi Player... lack of dedicated servers killed the PC version. Lack of maps is a huge letdown too. It just shows you that todays gaming scene wants to milk map packs as DLC and charge you. As for the game play, not as good as it was in my early AVP gaming years. Rebellion's AVP 1999 game (since they made their first AVP on Jaguar around 1994) was the king of online game play. Required you to have skills over all races, and it was faster paced. Even the single player of AVP 1999 was better than this one. AVP 2 introduced a class system which worked rather well online. The only gripe I had with AVP 2 MP was the poor network coding, making huge amount of lag even for broadband internet.  RECOMMENDATION: On a finishing note, even as a huge fan of this gaming franchise and even the movies and comics, this AVP is a serious stripped down AVP 1999 except much disappointing. Too stripped, way too much content removed from Rebellion's AVP 1999 and it shows badly. HOWEVER, I'd recommend this AVP game any time over 'Gearbox Aliens: Colonial Marines'. The gameplay is way more fun and consistant. Also, AVP looks much better than Colonial Marines... a game that came out two years AFTER AVP! Lastly, you may want to get this game for the campaign mode since the MP is quite pointless without dedicated servers and the matchmaking truly suck bad!  RATING: 5.5 / 10
9575	0	a	The new AVP is bad. I was a huge fan of the first AVP from 2000 and its sequel but the new one is amazingly flawed in its execution.  The only way to really kill anything is with a headshot and the AI is psychic and knows exactly where you are aiming even if it has its back turned to you so for the Space Marines the only effective way to kill anything is to pistol whip it and shoot it in the head as it staggers. This makes combat as the marines rather dull as the game sends hordes of mobs against you at a time giving you two options. Try and fight them properly and run out of ammo or be easily over run or Pistol whip, shoot in head and live.  The map design is also terrible. Each map ends in the exact same way. Wait for the elevator and fight off the swarm. Every freakin' level.  As for atmosphere as the Marines the game is has a great deal of suspense until you discover the entirety of the games combat involves circle strafing and pistol whipping at which point it becomes a farce.
9576	0	a	Boring
9577	0	a	piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ doesnt work!!!!
9578	0	a	Let me get this straight. The game isn't bad. Rather, it seems reasonably good. My problem is more with the multiplayer than the singleplayer, however I do dislike the Marine campaign.  The multiplayer to this game is next to DEAD, with one or two lobbies at a time, with one or two players. The quick-match doesn't work, because you need to get a full set of players for it to begin. The server browser shows the couple servers there are, but these servers are nearly empty. Couldn't even get into a single match to see whether or not it was good, so I guess it's not.  I only did a little of the Singleplayer, and got about half an hour into the Marine campaign. It started well, good atmosphere, ok controls (could be better, but not bad), and aliens showing early in. However it quickly ramped up the difficulty, and got me to a point I could not pass. Again, I only played HALF AN HOUR, and I could not get by a part. This was on NORMAL difficulty, I might add. I might understand more if it was on hard, but it wasn't. I was getting instantly cornered and killed by 2 or 3 aliens when I had to wait for the stupid elevator. That's when I quit. That's when I decided it's worth refunding.  5/10 probably WAS good, but ISN'T good anymore.

9583	0	a	Not very challenging, completed marine missions in 4hrs. Got bored with alien version
9584	0	a	The game was really fun, untill everyone started hacking and the game became dead, i loved playing this game on console, but when i thought it would be the same on pc, i was wrong.  Pros -some what good story game play -great graphics,  -Easy to learn  Cons -The game is dead -A lot of the online player base are using hacks -If there are usally 5 preds vs 2 aliens vs 1 marine, and the preds just keep rising because no one wants to lose  if the game wasnt so dead and full of hackers, i would recommend buying this game.
9585	0	a	A solid game mechanichs-wise, but story-wise very lacking. But That is not the focus of the game, multiplayer is. In this case your mileage may vary, the best thing about it is the 3 different gameplay styles for every playable race, but the game overall lacks depth. As a result I got bored with the game rather quickly, so unless you can play for days aganist other players, honing your abilities, even if the game offers very little beyond that, it is a solid, but not outstanding title. Otherwise, it's only fun for a couple of hours.
9586	0	a	This game could be one of the most disapointing games of all time. Do not get.   The only fun part was the multiplayer but its completely dead now.
9587	0	a	Got this to play co-op with my husband. Unfortunately, the co-op in this game is severely underdeveloped. Might be fun otherwise, but I can't recommend it.
9588	0	a	Played this for few hours. Then leave it. No single interest anymore. Dont buy.
9589	0	a	Overpriced, even at 9.99 on special
9590	0	a	Stories were great, but Multiplayer is dead now. Multiplayer was the reason why i actually bought this game...
9591	0	a	It use to be quite enjoyable, but now it reeks of filth like all the peasants in King's Landing...
9592	0	a	40 of those hours was waiting in lobbies â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this 'game'
9593	0	a	Not worth a full RRP. Its enjoyable for what it is but the Alien Campaign was completed in an hour and a half with very little difficulty. The Mahrine and Predahtor Campaigns are a little more lengthy, starting at different points but theres very little 'cross over relevance' other than you shoot one or two of the other.  Get it on the cheap Â£5 or less.
9594	0	a	I wasn't impressed with this installation of AvP at all. It feels too heavily consolized or dumbed down for a console audience compared to the two older AvP games. I got bored of the predator campaign after only two levels. First of all it annoyed me immensely how the kill animations take like 20 seconds. Second, it annoyed me how all you have to do to distract marines is throw a rock then sneak up behind them as they go to investigate it. You do this over and over and over and over. Still, it's a much better game than Colonial Marines so definitely get this instead of that.
9595	0	a	I regret spending the paltry sum i did on what i can only describe as an enormous steaming pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that is this game. Do not commit the same folly as i.. Do not purchase this game.. Have some dignity, take it from a man who lost his.
9596	0	a	It stops running after the first cutscene in any of the campaigns.
9597	0	a	Game is Dead.
9598	0	a	The old aliens vs predator game from year 2000 was better then this one which is sad.
9599	0	a	This game is really good!!! Good stories, gameplay's AMAZING, alright multiplayer, co-op works great, amazing graphics!! A LOT of Cons though. In multiplayer Species DM (Death Match), I found Marines to be extremelly under powered and Predators to be extremelly over powered. Predators could just camp and use their Plasma Cannon, BAM one hit kill. Marines on the other hand, it would take almost a whole clip to kill a Predator and about half a clip for an Alien. That would take ALL of the clips for a gun, just by killing 3 Predators or 6 Aliens. Please balance these out, then I'd play Online Versus more. I found the single player stories to be rediculously short. It took me almost 2 hours to complete ALL of the story modes. ONLY 2 HOURS TO FINISH 3 WHOLE STORIES!!!!!! Seriousely, you should make them longer... I felt like I would start a story, and finish in what felt like 10 minutes but was actually 45. There is a lot of variety when it comes to weapons though except for the Alien. Predator; Plasma Cannon, Combi Stick, Mines, Disc, Wrist Blades. Marines; Pistol, Assult Rifle, Shotgun, SmartGun, Rifle. Alien; Tail and Claws. All in all, I would enjoy this game A LOT more if the stories were longer, multiplayer was balanced and more weapons for the Alien. Yes, the Alien can climb on almost ANY surface, but that isn't a weapon and the Predator can pretty much do that aswell so it isn't unique to the Alien. Improve story lengths, multiplyer and add more weapons to the Alien and I'll start enjoying it more and I can give it a better rating. Right now though? 3/10
9600	0	a	I now appreciate any game that doesn't feature Predator in all its OP entirety.  2.5/10  Volvo pls nerf
9601	0	a	The sad part about my having to downvote this game is that I actually love it, I can't even tell you how much fun I've had with this game over the multiple years now I have had it. The campaign modes are fun for like one playthrough but everyone should know the real kicker in this game is actually the multiplayer. Despite the bugs the game has some of the best multiplayer I've ever played (trumped only by AVP2) and some of the craziest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ has happened. Massive battles between 3 different teams is unbelievably fun. The problem is despite like 2 servers the community is dead. No one plays and it really kind of breaks my heart. The fact is no reason to buy this game really exists any longer.
9602	0	a	What I write about MP is based on two weeks.  Pros: cool designs. You get to do a lot of Alien, Predator, and Marine stuff. The three are relatively balanced. The melee, though awkward, works pretty well.  Cons: Bare bones as far as content goes, with almost no weapons, features, maps, etc. In spite of dedicated servers, there are usually two, or as little as one, server with players on. Hardly anyone plays anything but Species Deathmatch, and that one does get old. SP gets monotonous within minutes. The story is boring, the three endings unsatisfying, and they have the gall to hint at a story far more interesting than this one... if you can tell a good story, Rebellion, then how about following up on the great one Sierra gave us? Short campaigns. Rushed. Lazy. Wall-Crawling doesn't always work.  For SP, play the first two games again. The MP of those two is more or less dead, so... for MP, L4D2 is far more fun, distinct, varied, etc. than this.
9603	0	a	I Recommend that you DO NOT get this game
9604	0	a	Can't decide which is worse, this or Colonial Marines.   One thing's for sure, they're both nothing compared to the old PC classic Alien vs Predator 2.   Grab that if you can instead.
9605	0	a	a simple cash graber in my opinion but i got it for 75% discount on it so i am happy  and was enjoyable for the first 30 minurtes
9606	0	a	At this time it does not work on my computer. Will update if I can fix it. 
9607	0	a	This game has sensitive controlling. good graphics but slight problem via multiplayer server matchmaking
9608	0	a	there is no players on the multiplayer .
9609	0	a	The game launches, i see the logos than gets stuck on a black screen. can anybody help?
9610	0	a	You'll never play as the marines
9611	0	a	Its not a bad game dont get me wrong but everything just feels so blah.
9612	0	a	it's meh. The balance is in favor of predator. I would only buy this game if the price drops down. It can be fun but alien is really frustrating, marine is fun and predator is OP! There will be no more DLC or any balance changes as SEGA has cut off all support. Again, only buy this game if there is a sale or you absolutely love AvP like I do. I give this game a 6/10 for a mediocre campaign with an OK multiplayer.  I reinstalled the game recently just to have fun and I'm not taking this game seriously at all, I recommend you do the same if you buy it.
9613	0	a	Now, as a big fan of AVP, I must say This is very disappointing game. I played the very first AVP game and I'm dying to know why the heck they didn't include baby alien gameplay in it. That was the best beginning of Alien chapter. I feel The game could be way more developed than how it is now. Not to mention that Predator and Alien are way underpowered IMO. Why would you remove the attack for Alien bite? Why? Now you have to press E and hopefully you're going to chomp someones head off. The game itself is very... well IMO it lost the touch. On the other hand, I like the story. It's very mobile, I like the Predator's jumping system. I also like the environment. Game is.. very short. But for this money.. well I recommend you buying some other game, or if you really want to play it then go ahead. You're not missing anything. 4/10
9614	0	a	Stories were great, but Multiplayer is dead now. Multiplayer was the reason why i actually bought this game...
9615	0	a	BoÅŸuna almayÄ±n, gÃ¼zel bir oyun deÄŸil. - Do not buy this game, it is not good. You probably will not play it again after a few hours playing it.
9616	0	a	Its not a bad game dont get me wrong but everything just feels so blah.
9617	0	a	A warning to anyone who's planning to buy this and wants play the story with a friend: this game does not have that option, the co-op is only in skirmish games.
9618	0	a	I would not reccomend this game if you plan to play online with it, the story is nice tough but the online sucks, teams are unbalanced and the predator is to overpowerd having all that is needed to withstand a 10 v 1 situation and most of the time it is only predators.
9619	0	a	This is an okay shooter for 2010. So take it for what it is.  I had to stop playing after a brief attempt because the voice acting for the character 'Tequila' was god awful. Painful even.  5/10 (6/10 If they delete Tequila)

9621	0	a	Single player is awesome. Multiplayer is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If you think its going to be an avp2 experience, look away my friends, look away.  Predators are overpowered. Expect games where predators outnumber both aliens AND marines combined. Not as rare as one might think.  You might be thinking 'Oh, i'll be going alien, surely since its a melee only class i must have an advantage in close combat, or at the very least, a teeny tiny advantage.' HAHAHAHAHA! Nice balance.  The entire combat premise of this game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rock-paper-scissors farcical. Light attack beats heavy, block beats light and heavy beat block. As expected, heavy does more damage + has a longer casting animaton. BUT, you can actually CANCEL the animation by blocking! So you can make it look like you're going to heavy attack, and then immediately transition to a block! WHY THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DOES THIS EXIST? What is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing point of creating a rock-paper-scissors mechanic if you are going to radically change the entire god damn premise of it?  The previous avp games were filled with intense fast paced multiplayer action! And this one is just, disappointing.   If you are going to have a rock-paper-scissors combat, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing do it properly! God!
9622	0	a	Single Player Review  This is a review specifically of the marine portion of the AVP single player campaign. I have to say I am not impressed. It looks right, but it doesn't feel right. The core gameplay is inherently flawed in several different annoying ways.  Firstly, the basic combat is just wonky. The weapons are not particularly well balanced. The pulse (assault) rifle for instance is good for pretty much nothing, yet the shotgun will kill basically anything that moves. In fact a sniper rifle-shotgun combo makes this game stupidly easy. This brings me to another particularly idiotic game design quirk: every time you start a new level, the game takes away your weapons and gives you a predetermined loadout. This is utterly inexcusable.   To my surprise the aliens did actually make decent use of wall climbing maneuvers, and generally being sneaky little buggers. Little buggers. They are not nearly imposing enough in my opinion. This is where it loses me. Not only can your hero marine character literally knock the seven foot tall monstrosities on their spiky arses, but it is an integral part of the combat that you will be doing over and over and over again. This is a complete misrepresentation of a formidable movie monster, and it should not be overlooked.   The predators rarely make an appearance in the marine campaign, and when they do they are portrayed as a vastly superior monster compared to the unfortunate alien which has been reduced to cannon fodder. The predator boss battle if you would call it that is bizarrely easy however. I didn't take any damage at all for the duration of the fight. The thing would just stand on rooftops, shine its massively visible laser at you and then shoot an impractically slow plasma ball at you. If you are imagining the imp fireball from doom, you wouldn't be far off.   As far as the actual level progression, and design goes, it is a lot of follow that nav point and the open this door/press this switch/secure this area/etc. It attempts to vary up the level design with some â€œjungleâ€ exterior settings, and a cave system, to take the player away from the familiar steel corridors for a while. I say jungle in the loosest possible terms. It is about four trees and a bit of shrubbery.   The story isn't even worth mentioning, aside from the fact that they got Lance Henrickson to play Weyland Bishop.  
9623	0	a	Can't decide which is worse, this or Colonial Marines.   One thing's for sure, they're both nothing compared to the old PC classic Alien vs Predator 2.   Grab that if you can instead.
9624	0	a	nope not this time!
9625	0	a	dead multiplayer
9626	0	a	a simple cash graber in my opinion but i got it for 75% discount on it so i am happy  and was enjoyable for the first 30 minurtes
9627	0	a	At this time it does not work on my computer. Will update if I can fix it. 
9628	0	a	not the best alien v predator production, yes it has cool graphics and attack/stealth moves, but honestly for game mechanics and level layout its a little below average, i was very disappointed to see this game having an 'you have to do it this way approach' i would of loved to of seen it much more dynamic as how you approach completing the level.
9629	0	a	A truly masterful game design. Never before have I been so disappointed. Whittling down the Predator to 4 weapons and kill animations, auto-wallrun for Aliens, the removed grenades for the marine, everything about this game is a dumbed down simplified version of the highly technical masterpiece that was AVP 2.
9630	0	a	I spent all 0.6 hours of my playtime on this game trying to figure out how to crouch. I have come to the realization that there is no crouching in this game.. I am now sad and crouching in a corner wishing there was a more to life. Thanks Aliens Vs. Predator thanks.
9631	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES now usually i dont listen to neggative reviews but seriously  i usually loom at the good's of a game and here is the only good thing the movement and some of the abilties Campaign is interesting BUT Multiplayer is heavily unbalanced and they are not planning to do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this game because  it is related to sega (i knew it was destined for the sewers) Aliens are extremly weak and useless dont play as them Marines shotguns will one shot you even if you hit them they dont care and predators..... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ those guys they just jump around and knock you down and then double heavy attack you because you CANT DO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ BECAUSE YOU ARE KNOCKED DOWN OH BOO HOO  seriously this game is the worst i really dont think you should buy it even on sale
9632	0	a	This game is like the AVP movies, (i mean, it amazes my brains how a movie about Aliens against Predator is boring... relentless creatures with acid for blood versus the ultimate space hunter of the universe, how can you make that mediocre? just add some dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥ gringo movie plot instead of science fiction and voilÃ¡)   But I guess if you liked those flicks maybe you would like this game... the story is about a Bishop android being the boss in Weyland Yutani and openning a Predators ancient temple type of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ of the universe, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happens cuz humans still dont learn that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing with xenomorphs is a bad idea, predators are watching from space, the planet is their playground, the story is shared but not mixed directly between the 3 characters. As you advance in the game storyline you will find many clichÃ© â™¥â™¥â™¥ predictable â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ including the ending.  The gameplay for the marine is crap, he cant crouch, the smart gun is a new model but feels horrible, actually most of the guns are lame, weapons iconic sounds are missed, a thing about the marine, he has no name, they just call him the rookie, and he never talks.... wtf, they try to do the bonding â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like in Half Life with Gordon Freeman but they failed, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the rookie. And he cant crouch.  The alien gameplay is kinda cool tho, it can be really fast and you get to execute victims or holding them to get facehugged (the bad of the good part: the alien design is like the ones on the Alien: Resurrection movie, with chicken legs and funny hands) the predator is not that bad, but as he have many weapons to operate sometimes dealing with enemies is like slow and dull, changing vision modes should have been more dinamic too.  Multiplayer, at this point is dead, you must be really lucky to find a game with decent number of people to make the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fun.  I remember the old AVP games, they were so good, the first one was even scary but my fav was the second one and its expansion, good times and decent story like in the comic books, the first one is here on Steam so buy it and avoid this unless is in a special cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥ deal or something   4/10 mediocre, could be worst... like Aliens: Colonial Marines
9633	0	a	Now, as a big fan of AVP, I must say This is very disappointing game. I played the very first AVP game and I'm dying to know why the heck they didn't include baby alien gameplay in it. That was the best beginning of Alien chapter. I feel The game could be way more developed than how it is now. Not to mention that Predator and Alien are way underpowered IMO. Why would you remove the attack for Alien bite? Why? Now you have to press E and hopefully you're going to chomp someones head off. The game itself is very... well IMO it lost the touch. On the other hand, I like the story. It's very mobile, I like the Predator's jumping system. I also like the environment. Game is.. very short. But for this money.. well I recommend you buying some other game, or if you really want to play it then go ahead. You're not missing anything. 4/10
9634	0	a	Id rather play a hd version of the early 2000s Of AVP2 hell if they still had online servers I would buy AVP2 off steam The avp1 gold edition had nothing on avp2
9635	0	a	It's not bad but it hasn't aged well. Multiplayer is crap, and there is no avp2 lifecycle mode.
9636	0	a	You'll never play as the marines
9637	0	a	it's meh. The balance is in favor of predator. I would only buy this game if the price drops down. It can be fun but alien is really frustrating, marine is fun and predator is OP! There will be no more DLC or any balance changes as SEGA has cut off all support. Again, only buy this game if there is a sale or you absolutely love AvP like I do. I give this game a 6/10 for a mediocre campaign with an OK multiplayer.  I reinstalled the game recently just to have fun and I'm not taking this game seriously at all, I recommend you do the same if you buy it.
9638	0	a	This game is graphically beautiful and has a unique feel. I feel bad not recommending it, but the gameplay is repetitive and I'm not particularly motivated to keep playing it. It's as though I *should* like this game more than I actually do.  If it's on sale, you may wish to purchase it just to see what it's like. But for me, playing it was a chore.
9639	0	a	 ~ The Kid just rages for a while. ~   Great at first, but gets old very quickly. For every pro, there's a con. Let's start with the good stuff. The colourful, fresh art style and the fast-paced combat are Bastion's biggest pro's. It plays well, it looks great, the cold and unfamiliar atmosphere is well supported by the good soundtrack. Also, being able to change the difficulty in-game by using Idols is a great way to manually spice up the game if you're finding it too easy. Bastion is a quite easy game, so being able to experiment with that was a good touch.   On the other hand, it's very vital that they did. Because the gameplay (despite fun in the beginning) tends to get old quickly. Sure, you unlock more weapons as you progress, but it doesn't take long before you familiarise yourself with a certain set and feel comfortable with it, so you don't have any incentive to use the other weapons. The underwhelming story and mediocre level design don't really incentive you to adapt to environmental dangers either. It all looks so much alike, you progress is the same fashion as the first hour, the narrative pacing is very sub-par. Most of the time it's a straight path with very little dead ends where you can find extra items and upgrade materials.  + Visual design is colourful and looks good. + At first, gameplay was fun and being able to change the combat was a great touch. + You can experiment with the difficulty yourself (with the Idols). + Nice soundtrack. + The narrator gave the game its own unique identity at first, but...  - Later the narrator just becomes boring, adds nothing new, and even gets a little annoying. - Gameplay gets old rather quickly, despite being able to spice up the combat. If it wasn't for that, it would have even gotten old a lot sooner. - Uninteresting story with even less interesting characters. - Mediocre, unmemorable and extremely linear level design that doesn't do the good art style justice. - 'Action RPG'? Don't make me laugh. This is absolutely the bar minimum.   I don't recommend it. I got it for free, and even then I feel disappointed. So to me it's not a matter of price, but a matter of spending your time with Bastion. To be very honest, in hindsight I think I would have rather spend my 11 hours on something else. It had great potential, but unfortunately it just gets old so, so quick.
9640	0	a	Played it on The Recommendation Of Everyone In The Whole World but it's not that good. The graphics are great, the soundtrack is great, the narrator is great... the colours, the scene, the history, the theme..... everything you'd think would make a great game is there... except for the fact that it's actually just a bloody chore to play through. I just switched it off, halfway through a level, coz I was just so sick of another group of monsters attacking me.  It's not fun killing them, no matter how much everything else around that is beautifully presented.  
9641	0	a	Bastion is a polarizing game. Basically, I feel confident in saying you will either love this game to bits and find yourself writing essays about how brilliant and deep and awesome this game really is, or find it one of the most obscenely, dangerously overrated, yet pretty good-looking and fine-sounding, piece of pretentious indie [you know that word] you'll ever play.  Luckily for you, Oh Revered Prospective Buyer, you don't need to rely on the confusing cacophony of opinions of other people to figure out which camp you'll find yourself in in. Like, don't like, and wait... why? For, you see, O Might One, this game is endowed with the Mystical Power of The Demo.  Demos are strange beasts and too often misleading ones as well, willfully tricking the Player. But this will not be the case for Bastion: you will either think this game has the most boring minute-to-minute gameplay experience of the isometric action RPGs you ever had the terrible misfortune to play, or that it'll be to you about as good an invention as The Revered Sliced Bread, maybe even a slice better.  It doesn't matter which button I'm going to press when I am done writing, because obviously the majority thinks I'm the minority and thus this one single vote is simply a drop in the ocean and won't matter one single bit. That is fine and dandy as it gives me a chance to be completely honest without incurring in any unwarranted backlash, isn't that true Almighty Community?  You won't downvote this &lt;cough&gt;review, because while I almost dread every single hour I spent on it (, I'm still encouraging people to be open minded instead of trusting my judgment blindly, as it were The Word, and try the demo for themselves. Which you should really do: you have very little to lose and much to gain.
9642	0	a	This is not a bad game. But I've owned it for over 2 years and have tried picking it up on several different occasions only to never completely get into it. I don't feel very attached to the characters and story. It's all extremely vague, which can make some games fun because you get curious and want to explore more and play more. But if it wasn't for the narrator talking into my ear there would be no story. His voice is everything... and I kind of don't like that.  The gameplay felt really tight. The weapons can be somewhat interesting when you combine them with different power ups. I probably should have set my game on a harder difficulty because I found no challenge to it, but that's my own fault. I used the keyboard. The artwork is swell. I never fell in love with the music, although it is ever-present and perfectly fitting. The enemies are cool but kind of repetitive. I think that's about it. There's really nothing that stands out wrong with the game in my opinion, except for the story resting so highly on one overdramatic voice, even though that's the part everyone raves about. And to me, if you have a problem with the story then you have a problem with the game because the story is one of the biggest reasons why I'd ever even play a single-player game.  I believe that I now realize what my other main issue is. I said 'there's really nothing wrong with the game', but there's also nothing that special about it either. You strip away the artwork and the [annoying] narrator and it's just some run-of-the-mill barebones top down 'twin-stick shooter', as someone in my comments had said. Twin-stick shooter. That genre might still be fresh enough for many people but for someone like me gaming into their late 20's who has already played quite a bit of those it doesn't do enough for me. Bastion is just not for me I suppose.
9643	0	a	I feel bad giving Bastion a thumbs down but unfortunately I just didn't enjoy it. This isn't because I think it's a bad game as it's clear why it has received so much praise, but the repetitive gameplay led me to fail in my quest to play it through. It's pretty, and the aesthetic overall is endearing and the narration too is an interesting touch, however overall it failed to grab me and make me want to see it through to the end.
9644	0	a	While this game isn't completely terrible, there is also just nothing about this game that really enternained me or that I felt was done well. It's just a very basic fight and don't die type of game with a very uninteresting story.
9645	0	a	The reason why I bought Bastion was because of the immense praise and positive reviews it recieved on release. That might have been a mistake on my part, since I expected it to be a lot more than what it turned out to be. I didn't get the indie gem I thought I was getting, but instead a mediocre hack n slash with some underwhelming RPG elements slapped on top.   It does have one thing going for it admittedly, and that's the presentation. The isometric graphics are beautiful, they were clearly shown a lot of love, and the narration is enjoyable, even though it gets kind of irritating after a while.  The gameplay on the other hand is dreadful. It may be responsive and functional, but it is incredibly dull and repetitive and offers little challenge or variation. The levels are essentially all the same, there are no puzzles or interesting gameplay elements to differentiate them, only a slight difference in color hue and tileset. There isn't much enemy variation and it just feels like you're powering through mob after mob to get a little bit of story to keep you going(and the story is only decent at best).  My advice is to try the demo and see how you like it, since it will give a pretty good idea what you will do for the rest of the game. Don't believe the hype.
9646	0	a	The gameplay is tedious and boring, and I generally enjoy 'repetitve' gameplay. The world is boring, and the narration, which was cited as what made this game stand out is annoying, distracting, and rarely informative of anything important. Simply a Ron Pearlman imposter telling you what you already know.
9647	0	a	ENG:  I've tried playing a few times as a console as the Steam version. I do not know just exactly what the game is fine, or interested in, but it did not hit me. I just was disappointed with the game when it was released. Similarly, in terms of the corresponding published in the game, 'Transistor'. The game does not just simply tired of interest.

9649	0	a	This game has an amazing soundtract and a decent story but all it has for gameplay is combat. If you don't like isometric shoot 'em ups (cuz that's basically what it devolves into) then just watch a lets play on Youtube for the soundtrack and the story. Funnily enough I got much more enjoyment out of the soundtrack than the game itself.
9650	0	a	Despite all the love for the game, I can't recommend it. Unless you want a very slow and sluggish hack-and-slash that is repetitive and who's weapons are generic for the most part.   I'm not sure why the developer made your character move so slow and sluggishly, and no, it's not because this game requires precise and accurate controls. This made the entire game a slog. Basically it's whack whack whack, as the different enemy types do not require a specific method of attacking them and they all fall after a few basic hits. Even the weapons and their 'upgrades' all basically are different variants of the same.  All of these hides behind a nice coat of pain and sound that, I have to admit, is a treat for the eyes and ears. But with regards to everything else, the game falls flat.
9651	0	a	This has to be one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure to play, and it's all because of it's terrible block mechanic.  With a proper block mechanic, I'd have recommended this game.   I know this review will get a lot of negative ratings from fans. I don't really care.  Enjoy hitting that 'unhelpful' button without reading.  So in order to appease you fans of this game, let's start with the good:  -The game is gorgeous. Despite how absolutely dreadful some of it's aspects are, art isn't one of them. -The game's soundtrack is great. -The narrator is also very good. Actually, the whole sound design (things getting hit, things exploding) is rock solid across the board. -The game does an adequate job of letting you know where you are and where you need to go without leading you by the nose. There are a couple markers early on. I don't recall too many after that. -Upgrade materials are placed in intuitive locations; you won't need a walkthrough to find the last upgrade material for a weapon or anything annoying like that. Story bits are also intuitive. -Game takes a while to complete, which I always count as a positive. Even in games I dislike, like this one, because for those who do like it that means more stuff to do and more entertainment time per dollar. -Customizable difficulty beyond just 'The monsters are stronger!' or 'The monsters are weaker!' in the 'gods' system; each god can be activated individually, and grant the monsters special bonuses (such as: explode on death, increased damage reduction, regeneration, increased damage etc).  Now, where to start on my list of gripes?  -Let's start small: the game constantly swaps out your loadout whenever you get a new weapon or skill. This is frequent, as there are many weapons and skills in the game. This isn't praise, though, as they're mostly useless. What this means is that the game will take away your favorite, highly-upgraded power weapon in favor of some worthless piece of unupgraded junk, then tell you to complete a level with it. This is all the more appaling considering we have TWO weapon slots, but the game will not default to taking away the first or second; melee ones will equip the first, ranged the second, and you can't possibly know what random junk the game will throw at you without reading a walkthrough (which will ruin the whole story aspect of this story-based game).  -Gods are not unlocked from the beginning, and must be earned even when you do unlock the shrine. Also, gods are only for increasing difficulty, not decreasing it. Players who struggle with the game will realize that it's got no 'easier' mode. While I believe the game to be fairly easy when it doesn't cheese, I've been playing for most of my life, and those who haven't and are struggling will be annoyed by this.  -Next up: targetting. How do you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up targetting? Well, if you're bastion you do, because you're 'special'. Normally, if I want to target something I indicate those wishes to the game by pointing at it with my mouse. In general, a game will pick up targetting within a reasonable range of the target (and not exclusively on top of it). Bastion, though, begs to differ; not only do you have to point directly at the target, you also have to keep your mouse on the target to shield from it when faced with multiple enemies. Where this fails spectacularly is that there are multiple high-speed or teleporting enemies in the game, and they just vanish from your mouse cursor, making your character turn around and target an enemy outside your field of view and who isn't attacking you.  -Okay, perhaps those could be excused (they can't). What's next? Upgrades. All the upgrades in this game are boring. They are all 'faster reload by X%' or 'X% more damage' or '+X ammo capacity'. And when it's not that it's 'more knockback' or 'can now stun' - absolutely generic, boring, and frankly unworthy of a world in which we are constantly on freaking flying pieces of rock. Couldn't you have invented something a bit more interesting?  -There is no invulnerability frame after taking damage. Dust: An Elysian Tale did this on it's hardest difficulty too, and it was just as stupid there; there, if you touch spikes it's pretty much a game over (across several minutes as the spikes take 1-2 health away per second out of your 700+ total). In Bastion, if you ever find yourself in a position where you are flanked (and you will, because the game spawns enemies behind and in front of you simultaneously) then because of the aforementioned â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ blocking you're likely to have the character try to block a guy who isn't attacking you, take damage, rotate around to the guy who just hit him, take more damage from the previous guy and either die or rotate again... Which means you take more damage. Repeat until either dead, use a special skill, manage to get your mouse cursor over one of them or get out of range and line them up.  -The enemies are stupid. They run around like headless chickens, fall into pits, slam into walls and keep running into them for a fair few seconds.  Bosses? Ones that can move will very frequently just fall off into a pit and die instantly, even if you don't want them to. A leaping boss fairly late into the game was apparently so terrified of me, he turned right and just jumped off when I approached.  -The story is non-sensical. It's about as stuck up it's own rear end as Final Fantasy XIII 2. Seriously, I have no idea what the hell am I supposed to be working towards; every time I gather something (shards, cores, whatever) some rampaging plot device comes and undoes my work. Why should I even bother to keep trying again? Because allow me to ask... 'Have I ever told you the definition of insanity?'  -Challenges are pointless. Again, unless it rewards you with an upgrade component for your main weapon(s) (which most won't, as two of three of their rewards will be an upgrade component and a skill for them) then they're about as useful as throwing peas at the screen when you see an enemy, because you won't be using them. There isn't even a way to know what enemies you'll find or what the terrain will look like, so you can't know what weapons will be good.  All in all, I give this game a 'broken essential mechanic / 10'. If you can get over how horrible blocking is, this could easily be a 7/10 or even an 8/10, but I can't.
9652	0	a	It couldnt keep me interested long enough to finish.  GG...   2/5
9653	0	a	This game is gorgeous, and the voice acting is just phenomenal. The controls feel great, and the animations are great, and so forth.  Why don't I recommend it, then? Well... it just doesn't hold my interest. Fights really feel very samey in a lot of ways, and I don't get a real sense of a story that I care about or atmosphere that moves me. I feel like I'm just kind of going through the motions. And for some games that's okay -- it's 'bubble wrap popping fun,' and that's great. But this game doesn't have that tactile 'bubble wrap' element, at least not for me, so it leaves me with nothing except the visual beauty and the narrator.  I really want to like this game more than I do. That said, a lot of people really do love it way more than I do, so it's by no stretch a bad game. I can't recommend it personally, but you may find that you love it. Read other reviews, too.
9654	0	a	Everybody keeps telling me thath Bastion is great.   Sadly I do not see it, there are some elements that are good like the hand drawn graphics and the narrator (although gets on my nerves with his far too frequent comments).  All the elements together makes for a very slow, repetitive and boring game. You wanna try it? Make sure you buy it on a sale or in a bundle.
9655	0	a	Kid thought his life was going to be great, since he'd heard glorious things of his life from everyone. He wandered around in pretty looking places while being constantly called Kid and narrated by voice that didn't seem to fit in the world. Ultimately Kid found everything to be very repetitive and no fun to be found anywhere, and what is life without joy? The Kid thought to himself, 'This might have been nice experience if I actually were my age and not such an old soul' and decided to end his existence as it was better that way.  1.5 Kids' out of 5.
9656	0	a	This game is horrendously over-rated.  The gameplay itself is quite poor and one-dimensional. You basically button mash melee to beat up enemies and occasionally hold the (B) button to do ranged shots. You can do special attacks (such as spin-around attack for 3 seconds) one per bottle of Black Tonic you find.  The game is presented in isometric perspective, with the game world floating in space. As you walk around the floor tiles fly up from nowhere and form the floor you walk on. This is and interesting presentation effect for the first 3 seconds, then it gets to be real tedious watching the level fly around. After an hour it's just sickening to watch. Furthermore, you don't know where you can walk in an area until the path has flown together. I bashed endlessly into dead ends trying to see where I should go next and whether a new path would fly up. Monotonous and a bad game design choice.  Then the narrator. Ooooohhhh the narrator. It narrates most actions you take in the game from walking into a new room to breaking boxes for currency. Neat concept again, interesting for the first minute or two, but absolutely maddening thereafter with no way to shut it off. To make it worse the narrator is done in 'Dismissive American Vigilante' accent, and no disrespect to the voice artist but for me it just did not work as it came off as totally inauthentic, and jarringly inappropriate for the rest of the game's theme. The cringe-y writing didn't help either.  I put in my hour waiting for something to happen and nope, just no more time will be wasted. Strip away the flashy presentation and you have a lame button-masher beat-em-up that wouldn't be worth $0.25 on sale.
9657	0	a	It was alright for the first hour or so... But then it got really repetitive.  Art and soundtrack are amazing though.
9658	0	a	Is this still updated? Cant really give a review since it is really buggy and unplayable on debian w/ gnome de.
9659	0	a	i tried playing this game in virtual reality but a nasty voice appears. 0/10 might be demonic.
9660	0	a	Sadly this games offers nothing special. It just does not hook you or deliver.
9661	0	a	Says full controller support. Well game does not recognize the steam controller.
9662	0	a	As best as I can tell there's pretty much nothing to this game -- you just go around following a path and hitting enemies. In terms of depth and gameplay it's what you'd expect from a free Flash game.  People seem to inordinately impressed with the gimmick where the game is narrated in realtime, but as soon as you hear the announcer say the same thing a few times in a row it gets pretty old.  I honestly don't see anything to recommend Bastion at all.
9663	0	a	Well visually nice game, well drawn.. and fresh look at things with that narration. But too much is too much. I had a feeling designers were not sure what to do with this game after half. Story gets just worse and worse after half of the game and also the same with ending. Weapon choice is bad in game.. + ultra strong weapon right before end. What's the point of that? Game felt very very repetitive... Unfortunately can't suggest :(  Well at least music was nice.
9664	0	a	I played 5 hours. I couldn't figure out the plot. I am sure that this game would be fun for many people. I am not one of them.
9665	0	a	Feels like it was made for children of ages 5 to 10.
9666	0	a	  Bad  The atmosphere of this game is good. BGM is good too.  is like a fairy tale.  but there is no tension and thrill  so boring.  too boring to drowsy.    
9667	0	a	Somewhat overhyped. I'm not a fan of the narration which is supposedly a big selling point, or the music for that matter. Combat and leveling are both pretty flat.
9668	0	a	Decent gameplay, but ruined by an annoying cowboy narrator.
9669	0	a	boring
9670	0	a	I don't hate this game, but I don't particularly find it all that interesting either.  I mean, some people will get a lot of out if they enjoy this sort of button mashing type thing, but personally it wasn't for me. I think the art is nice, it's good to see vibrant colours. The story is weak, but is 'discovered' through a constant voice over explaining bits and bobs along the way.  Again, I don't hate the game. It's just not for me and I wouldn't recommend it to others despite the 'rave reviews' it seems to have gotten since it's release.
9671	0	a	I feel bad not recommending this game. Graphics are awesome, music is nice and voice acting is brilliant. The diversity in weapons and enemies is great too.  However, the repetitive gameplay and unapealing story (or maybe it's too slow) killed it for me, I really tried to enjoy it but I just can't.  Go to stage A and get x item. Go to stage B and get x item. Go to stage C and get x item. Rinse and repeat.   I wanna know more about the calamity, stop focusing on the Ura story!! I know nothing about the calamity after 3.5 hours or so and I've had endless information about Uras. I'm not even sure why I'm gathering X item anymore.  I would suggest getting this game on sale or if you like polished games even if they don't have too much depth.
9672	0	a	I tried really hard to like this game. In the end I stopped playing it because it was too repetitive. Same maps over and over again with slight variance. New weapon here, new monster there... The game had little depth.  Once you get past the novelty of the real time narration, you realise there's not a whole lot to the game. Story felt obligated, and added nothing to the game. After 4 hours i felt i'd seen everything i need to with this game.  + Graphics are cute + controller support + easy casual play  - repetitive - story - slow progression
9673	0	a	Pretentious narrative way too far up its own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with pretty basic gameplay but great presentation.
9674	0	a	Bought this game because of hype and recommendations. Everything about this game is REPETITIVE - the gameplay, the story, the narroator. I didn't enjoy playing it, for me this game has no depth at all - only enjoyed listening to the soundtrack.  Pros: + the environment is beautiful and really well designed + the soundtrack is amazing + the narroator is fun at first but quickly becoming repetitive and annoying   Cons: - the story is repetitive and boring - gameplay is repetitive  - the narroator - feels like a chore to play it  Overall: I will have to say I won't recommend it.
9675	0	a	This game was about 10 hours in playtime but you could complete it in much less time if you skipped all the practice levels that I played. The graphics looks stunningly vibrrant and music are great and was the main reason for me to play this game until the end. The gameplay though is repetitive â€“ each level is just more of the same â€“ some timings to attacks and defense kept the combat system interesting and not just being a button smashing time waste and made me play the game until completion.   I don't hate this game, but I don't find the story all that interesting either.
9676	0	a	I really wanted to get on the bandwagon and love this game. While beating this game was overall a good experience, I feel like it was just short of greatness. First of all the art direction, soundtrack, and atmosphere is something so terrifically amazing that most games struggle to achieve. I loved playing this game with my headphones on because it transports you to another universe. I even downloaded the soundtrack after playing the game.  The one pitfall would have to be the controls. I could never get 100% handle on the controls. I tried it out with both keyboard/mouse and Xbox controller. It was really annoying to constantly get injured by small little enemies. While you get a lot of new cool weapons and skills, they never seem enough for those enemies because the controls are wonky.  The story-line is way too abstract. It always hints at stuff yet never says what's happening. They try to make it arty when in fact it's just being lazy. The game knows it doesn't have a story, so they fake it. I commend them trying but it's not fulfilling.  Soundtrack &amp; Art Direction 9/10. Game 6/10

9678	0	a	Very nice looking, but incredibly boring. I'm only an hour and a half in but it's the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over and over: go here, kill everyone, break everything, get the crystal then leave.
9679	0	a	Bastion is polished to the point of being absolutely characterless. Everything about this game is technically really good, but at the same time it somehow manages to be lifeless and boring.   The gameplay is good, I honestly enjoyed it, but it wasn't fun. It was just good. The visuals and music are done well too, but there's nothing memorable about them. The plot is extremly general.   After finishing the game I'm not feeling any emotions. It wasn't frustrating, it wasn't fun, it was just, well, good. I can't find any reason not to recomend Bastion, but it is so mediocre that even a game less polished and techically worse in every aspect would seem to me like a more valuable way to spend time.
9680	0	a	Bastion is another indie game which is put on a pedestal for its presentation, even though its presentation is not nearly as revolutionary as it advertises itself as being. Once again the actual narrative is very thin on content, and the voice over narration is what people refer to when they discuss its 'amazing story'. The actual content of the game consists of walking on linear cubic paths in a void while engaging in very bland and unengaging 3rd person combat. The monotone narrator talks through the whole game, giving a greater sense of setting to the game than there really is by describing lore about the floating hallway you're traveling even though there is zero visual evidence of any the levels you're occupying as being a real place in any way.  The narrator itself is novel but not very engaging. He speaks with little to no inflection, and it can be easy to not pay attention to anything he says since you're too busy killing enemies on the current floating hallway void. The narration is supposed to be a revolutionary advancement for video game story telling, but it doesn't seem like the voice over is very noteworthy when there is basically no variation in what the player does, and the whole level is a literal linear floating void. The plot itself is vague and immaterial, and doesn't seem to go anywhere.  I really did give the game a go, and wanted to see what it would present next for a short while. The painterly art style is nice enough, even though the ambigious levels meant that changing areas amounted to pallet swaps. The music is also very nice and might be the best part about the whole game. What really got me though was the bland and easy gameplay, and Bastion's answer to giving the player more. The idols are a very good idea, games such as The World Ends With You and Kid Icarus Uprising certainly show how controllable difficulty can be done. The first few idols add some expected increases in challenge to the enemies you fight, such as increased health, faster attacks, and more damage. None of this really makes the game any harder, and the idols that come later basically consist of sabotaging the player, by making enemies randomly not take damage, and even inflicting slow movement on the player for attacking. I admit that the game was pretty difficult with all of these modifiers turned on, but what an artificial and tedious form of difficulty it was. If the only answer the devs have to players who want more interesting combat is 'play the game with one hand behind your back' then they shouldn't even bother.  I recommend for anyone curious about Bastion to play the demo first before purchasing. This is definitely not a must buy, and you should decide for yourself whether Bastion's various presentation gimmicks are as worthy of the praise it has been given. Do note as you play that the combat you experience at the beginning is an accurate representation of the whole game, and the game will never add new mechanics or interactions with the world other than new weapons. If what you played in the demo is what you would like to do for 8-10 hours straight, then feel free to buy it.
9681	0	a	Pretty good soundtrack, okay story, boring gameplay. Not to mention that the graphics look too flashy for my taste.
9682	0	a	I feel bad giving this a thumbs down because it's not like this was a bad game or that I didn't enjoy playing it.... But. Well, let's break things down into a plus/minus list, shall we?  THE GOOD + Soundtrack + Voice acting + Art + Mood  I played Supergiant's newer title 'Transistor' first, but this checks all the same boxes. If you're a fan of that one, you'll like this and vice versa.  THE NOT-SO-GOOD - Controls: Super clunky and at times unwieldy. WASD to move and then I have to hit Shift with my pinky? Yikes. I'm guess this is one of those games better with a controller. - Combat: STOP MAKING ME PICK UP ANOTHER WEAPON MID-LEVEL AND THEN FORCING ME TO USE IT. Ugh. - Price: $14.99? No thanks. I bought it on sale for under $5 - Playtime: I hit the ending in under 5 hours. That combined with the (regular) price is really what thumbs this down for me.  Now, don't get me wrong, there's replayability here. And lots of achievements to tempt you. But if you're a more casual player like I am... well, I don't really feel compelled to replay it. Which, as I said, combined with price/playtime doesn't make this worth it for me.  Don't get me wrong, it's a gorgeous game and it's not like I wouldn't recommend it. But I don't think the goods outweigh the bads in any significant way. If you're going to pick it up, definitely wait until it's on sale.
9683	0	a	Really wanted to like this, but it never clicked for me! Presentation is great, but the gameplay doesn't work for me. :(
9684	0	a	Bastion was a fun 2.5D shoot em up in the beginning, but after a couple hours it gets dull and repetitive. The gameplay and enemies are all the same throughout roughly 6-8 hours. Not too mention the boring narration that does not effectively tell a cohesive story.
9685	0	a	Repetitive and simplistic. Definitely not something I would have liked to spend 15 bucks on.
9686	0	a	Really tried to enjoy this game and understand the overwhelming praise surrounding it, but found the gameplay quite repetitive, and at times, finnicky with aiming and precise jumping, something that always plagues isometric games. The narration is iconic but it gets to a point of meaningless when every minor event is narrated in detail. The graphics and music are great, but despite picking the game up again many times, I always found myself playing it like a chore, to hold out for something more special, but it never came.
9687	0	a	A largely generic platform-style console game distinguished by its voice-over. A clever design idea, but one that I found didn't save the game from console/arcade repetition. If you like that sort of Nintendo-ey hammer-swinging and button mashing, this may be your thing. Wasn't mine.
9688	0	a	Ughhh...tried to like this, but it was so supremely boring and repetitive.
9689	0	a	Just...borning
9690	0	a	Not impressed. The way weapons are introduced means you're forced to use them for a section even if it doesn't go with your other weapon at all. Movement isn't great with keyboard and mouse. Use a controller if you have one. Aiming is awkward due to perspective. You need to aim for their feet but even then it can be unpredictable.
9691	0	a	.
9692	0	a	After playing the game for just over an hour, it's safe to say that I'm really disappointed with this game.  There are aspects that make this game enjoyable +Background music +High visual quality for a 2D game. It looks stunning and makes you feel like you're in a Disney cartoon movie. +The narrative approach of telling the story makes you feel like you're reading a book without actually reading +Just for fun. The game is not stressful and is perfect for relaxation.  However, there are rooms for improvement for the following: -The respawning mechanism is a joke. The player keep respawning in the middle of nowhere and have to die again no matter which direcion you go.  -Second chance? No way! There is a level where the floor keeps disappearing behind you so you have to hurry. When you die once, you will respawn at a place where the tiles are disappearing so therefore you will keep dying like an endless loop until the game is over.  -Combat mechanisms: If you like evading enemy attacks rather than countering them with your shield, then sorry to disappoint because you will fall off the map no matter how you evade. The combat areas are too small which don't allow players to dodge attacks instead of using the shield  Considering the pros and cons, I give this game an overall 3/10 Just because the gameplay makes me want to smash my computer, I will NOT buy games from Supergiant again.
9693	0	a	This not really a bad game, but I'm not a fan. The story is..ok at best. Each location has a 'backstory' that is all of five scentences, and the plot of the game itself is mediocre. The character backstory is extremely cliched as well. I will say the premise of the game, the idea, is really unique, though. That, and the game is really pretty with lots of colors, and a neat style. What kills this game for me is the gameplay. It is a typical hack and slash, so you're expect it to be repetative, but this one is really bad. Tha main issue is that there are probably only ten different enemies, and none of tham are really interesting to fight. So, that's my issue. It's decent, but the gameplay made it really hard to get though.
9694	0	a	The game's aiming system is total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The ranged attacks never hit where the line is.
9695	0	a	&gt;Saw this game recieve critical aclaim &gt;looked it up, seemed meh &gt;was recommended by friends &gt;gave it a try &gt;sorely dissapointed  I was not an awful game, but there is no reason it should have recieved the absurd amount of praise that it did. Soundtrack was good. Story was decent Gameplay just wasn't fun.
9696	0	a	Maybe someday I'll be able to stomach the annoying narrator and finish the game. I really wish there was a way to turn the narrations off.
9697	0	a	Thought I would like this one but didn't draw me in.
9698	0	a	This game is crap. Its full of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t tasks that a crazy hard compared to the rest of the game and aren't enoyable to play at all. I do not recommend this game at all. save your money and go buy undertale or something.
9699	0	a	It is incredibly hard to figure where you're going to move at times due to the perspective; many (')deaths(') because I thought the tiles to the side were part of the main walkway. Paths will not be shown you unless you're on the tile right before them; just wander the edges and sometimes off of them and trust the rocks in the sky will meet you.   Early on (it seems to get (')better(') as you get further through the game), there are multiple directions you can travel in while on a mission. You best be lucky in making the wrong choices first so as to fully explore and get all the loots - once you head towards the main path, the rest of the level will be off-limits; destruction will chase you out of the level, never allowing you to return again (until New Game Plus). You can't even rely on narration to let you know 'Okay, this is the correct way, go everywhere else first,' because, of course, everything is narrated. By 'it seems to get (')better('),' I mean that the levels seem to get progressively more linear.  Aiming is prone to be imprecise; cycling through your targets is totally arbitrary.  It seems there are vastly superior choices when deciding how to level your weapons, but seeing as how you are only given information on the current tier of upgrades, you won't know what the best build is until it's too late; this renders pursuing under-par times in the Challenges virtually impossible - at least way more difficult than they could've been. Had you known that the upgrade you forsook another, equally better one for was actually included twice in that weapon's upgrade tree, while the one you didn't get was only available while at that tier... you would've been able to have a better weapon(?)  I have to give the game a *Thumbs Down* because if any other game had these listed issues, I would not be able to recommend it; Bastion, however, is a very unique game and I CAN actually recommend it to others, just know that it is not without its faults - don't trust the hype blindly.  The gameplay is repetitive; I personally find the narrator exasperating ('Oh, he personified a ship, how darling... Oh, he's talking about Peckers and Stinkeyes, how innuendo... 'Oh, he did a play on words, how good (sincerely though).'). I personally find the gameplay very good except for the listed issues; others adore the game for the narrator.  Split the difference; *Thumb Sideways*
9700	0	a	While initially this game intrigued me with its visual style, I found the story, characters, and gameplay to be lacking. There wasn't enough development for me to become invested in the characters or the world they inhabited, and the hack and slash gameplay was repetitive. I never really got to a point where I felt like the game 'clicked' with me -- I spent most of the time feeling like I was still working through the prologue, and I still felt that way when I reached the end.
9701	0	a	i didn't realize that there is, in fact, a free demo for this game, and i strongly recommend that anyone interested in paying Real Bucks(tm) for the game try the demo first. i, for example, had heard glowing reviews from friends of vague acquaintances and also the internet, but had failed to take into account that these reviews had been written by people who 1) are actually good at games, and 2) have an attention span longer than 5 minutes. i honestly didn't get very far into the game, but it was enough to tell me that it is marketed towards a certain audience, and that audience is not me. if you (like me) generally play rpgs (but usually of a 2d/pixel persuasion), have visual impairments, do not have a controller or just all around suck at games, then this is the unrecommendation for you!  the graphics are nice but in my opinion it was just very distracting and made it hard to pick things out (also it slowed down my admittedly not advanced laptop). i need to specifically point out that if you don't have a controller, it is Really Hard to play. maybe i just suck and am used to just the whole left right jump side-scrolling type thing, but moving place to place was generally slow going and i didn't have the patience for it. the dealbreaker for me is that the narrator's voice in the beginning - i Really Hated It, and i had to force myself to keep playing. i'm so sorry. i think overall the general aesthetic of the game was not for me - didn't like the character (or, rather, i couldn't develop any semblance of Caring towards them), music wasn't personally appealing, controls difficult on keyboard, that Narrator - so if that's the sort of thing that would ruin one's game experience, tread carefully before throwing the cash dollar.  i'm sure it's a good game but man. i can't do it. i can't make myself play it for longer than five minute bursts
9702	0	a	It's got beautiful graphics and an unique way of deliverying the story, by having a narrator constantly telling it as you play.  You're 'the kid' and your actions and thoughts are spoken out loud throughout the game: 'the kid did this' , 'the kid feels that', 'the kid should be more careful and not step in mud', etc. While interesting at first, It's getting tiresome after a while, as is the whole action. It's repetitive and dull.
9703	0	a	It's a singular achievement to be able to create a game in which it is possible for the player to feel bored, even while fighting 20 mobs simultaneously. I do not recommend this game. The visual appeal will keep you going initially, but within a short time the repetitive, uninventive combat and superfluous 'story' will have you regretting your purchase.
9704	0	a	Bastion is really really pretty to look at, but it's not fun to play -- not with a mouse and keyboard at any rate. It's isometric and everything is on the diagonal, to top it off it's all done on floating platforms. Going everywhere diagonally using WSAD is a total pain, especially since one wrong step and you fall off the edge into the ether.   The mobs tend to be overpowered, fighting is repetitive. You end up with an impressive array of varied weapons to choose from, and they are all upgradable, but you can only chose two before you enter a (floating) dungeon with no idea what you will be fighting. You can also buy permanent buffs, but you can only have a few active at any time.  You have an inventory, but it is minimal and based purely on furthering the game. There is a story, but in the time I played it never grabbed me. I was too concerned with getting from point A to point B without falling (while wondering what was off the screen shooting at me) to ever really *care* what the protagonists problem was or what NPC's wanted me to do for them and why. For me, it ended up all about getting to the end of the dungeon with little joy getting there. I did not finish the game.  Pros: Truly gorgeous to look at Varied upgradable weapons A choice of upgradable buffs The narrator  Cons: Being forced to walk diagonally on floating platforms, or fall off Choosing weapons blindly Mobs and gauntlet running (on the diagonal) This game is playable on a PC, but definitely wasn't made for PC
9705	0	a	For a hardcore Diablo II, Torchlight II, and Angband player  Playing this game is almost as fun as watching my grandma's knitting (only cuz she curses some times...)  The gimmicks ('Dynamic' (NOT!) pseudo-cool world, Narrator, Goodish OST) just aren't enough to make this pretty shallow game good enough for me...  But then, I *MIGHT* be missing something (In the story/text, probably. Gameplay s#cks bad)
9706	0	a	Boring, ultra repetative, and more of a story-concept than an actual story. The seeds of a good game might be here, but this isn't it. Wish i could get the hours i spent playing it back.
9707	0	a	Fun for a single playthrough, and just the right length, I believe, despite the recycled plot mechanics used throughout the game itself. The story left me wanting more, or rather, I felt as if there was some room for strengthening the overall plot. Ultimately, you get the point, but a lot of the game I spent wondering why I even bothered to do these tasks, much less essentially the same task like 12 times through.  Gameplay wise, it's your typical hack and slash, didn't really find myself very intrigued to try many different weapon combinations. Definitely some frustrating mechanics and control issues, particularly with the environment and how you can easily fall through some areas (though this could just be my own fault). The narrator's style was not my cup of tea, although I realize many are a fan of it. But why is it innovative, exactly? Soundtrack was great, however.
9708	0	a	The art is phenomenal. The music is pretty good. That's about it.
9709	0	a	boring
9710	0	a	Not for me. I put too much trust in the reviews. I reccomend playing the demo to preview the game. It looks nice at least.
9711	0	a	The graph is good, but the control is not accurate enough. Sometimes I want to hit A, it hits B, I want to hit east, it hits west. Maybe it is because I haven't figured out the best way to play it.  NOTE: I played this game with keyboard, maybe a great better with mouse.
9712	0	a	boring
9713	0	a	fun for the first 15mins
9714	0	a	I'm sorry: it looks kindof cool but the movement is very imprecise. Also the fights are pretty awkward..   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnmbESlYu24 
9715	0	a	A lot of people said great things about Bastion, but I found the only good thing about it to be the music. Clunky controls and slow combat make me not want to recommend this game.
9716	0	a	Bastion, although visually appealing, sorta lost my interest half way through.
9717	0	a	After I played this game for the first time, I could not believe what great reviews it had gotten. Let me start by saying the obvious: this is not a role-playing game. This is an action-adventure game. I have a very simple rule: if my character's performance depends on my reflexes, it is not a role-playing game. If it depends on the character's reflexes, that's a role-playing game. This is emphatically not a role-playing game. If you are looking for an action-adventure game where your ability to do well will depend on your reflexes and your hand-eye coordination, you may enjoy this game. You will not otherwise. Related to that, there is the additional problem that the default controls are horrible. The game uses w, a, s, and d for movement, but uses q for special moves. I lost track of the number of times I burned a black potion by accidentally hitting q when all I wanted to do was move. The game also makes it way too much of a pain in the neck just to switch one weapon for another. All in all, I found myself fighting the interface more than the enemies. Things got much better once I reset the controls, but they ought not to have been that lousy in the first place.  My key complaint, though, was that I bought this game because it was sold as an RPG. It is not.
9718	0	a	It's like 90% of the whole gaming community recommends/praises/hails this game. Visuals and narrator carry it all the way. After like 2 hours you're fed up of it cause the gameplays so repetitive. The storys pretty mediocre imo. It's decent but get it when its on sale.
9719	0	a	Meh, for a game with glamorously high amount of good and amazing reviews this game is so simple and clunky, story is also meh as it is too slow to unravel and there is no ups and down nor plots it's just a random guy narating something happened in this kid's life. Played 12 hours and couldn't take anymore boredom. Uninstalled and wished I tried the demo first before foolishly believing overly good reviews that could probably be fake.
9720	0	a	 Mean Mr. Mustard's short Bastion review    1) Essential - buy it NOW  2) Recommended - buy it on sale   3) Avoid
9721	0	a	Salty review incomingâ€¦ This game had an impeccable reputation but it didnâ€™t jive with my tastes. The lauded art design is too loud for me, but I also canâ€™t stand the visual of LoL (perhaps I have a prejudice against neon colors) meanwhile, Iâ€™d assume millions of gamers disagree. Another prejudice; video games on the whole fail miserably when attempting to flex narrative muscles, Iâ€™d like to think Iâ€™m open minded, but Iâ€™m always let down thanks to my Game of Thrones level of expectations. Bastion is no exception; the storyâ€™s tone is a wannabe Legend of Zelda requiring far more investment than Iâ€™m willing to give an indie when I donâ€™t enjoy the mechanics thereof, more on that later. The constant narration gimmick was widely praised which surprised me, as its charming for maybe ten seconds before proving to be taking itself seriously for the duration of this experience, like Samuel L Jackson non-stop yelling levels of â€œyep this is what weâ€™re going to have to sit throughâ€. The camera angle felt disorienting for the amount of simple platforming the game asked (Surprise! The tiles youâ€™re walking on are now gone!). The combat felt spongy and fumblingly awkward. I kept playing for a while to find the gold described by critics, I canâ€™t remember if I finished the game, but no gold was found. The game function and is content rich with a great soundtrack for the price, but this alternate attempt of some sort of mix between a less charming Zelda with a more shallow Diablo did not impress me.
9722	0	a	Its very pretty but there isnt much point playing the game. All you really need to do is use Spacebar and WASD to run/roll around the place until the level finishes or the old dude speaks again. It would have made a far better animated TV series in my opinion, all the reviews say 'This is a piece of art!' and they may be right but you dont Play the Mona Lisa, you look at it.   I feel that Bastion falls under much the same category, vaguelly interesting to look it but no good for a decent game.
9723	0	a	Summary: Gameplay is frustratingly imbalanced and seemingly underdeveloped, keeping this title safely in the art house category instead of being an actual game.   Detail: Soundtrack, artwork, voice overs are all well done, but certain overpowered enemies, lack of ability to switch back to the weapon you entered a level with (when you discover a new weapon) and terrible map layout make this game more a frustrating waste of time than anything else. Supposedly the story is good (according to other reviews), but it's just too terrible to play to get to anything worth knowing. After every level there should be some strong piece of writing to bolster the story, but instead it just continues to meander in a sort of pseudo-philosophical rambling. In other words: get to the plot point already, please.  Play it for the music (though it gets repetitive), beautiful artwork and excellent voicework that narrates (almost) every action.   Don't expect to play an actual well-crafted game with an original (and interesting) story, however.
9724	0	a	If I could give this game an 8/10, I would, but Steam doesn't work like that. The game currently has 97% positive reviews which seems overrated, so I'm downvoting it.  Bastion has fluid gameplay, adaptable weapons, and adjustable difficulty with the shrine that gives enemies additional abilities if you find them too easy. It also has new game+ and score attack if you want to push things to the limit. The narration is innovative as well since it talks in real time while you progress through levels, but you can turn its volume down if you don't like it.   However, the game isn't all that. If you're 10-13, and this is your first time playing a game with a sophisticated plot, you'll like it. If you've played or read sophisticated plots in the past though, the game will seem bland. It really isn't that sophisticated, and even though there are flexible level select options as well as proving grounds to earn extra weapon abilities and upgrade, it's still pretty linear. At the end, you have two dilemmas to decide upon, but they really don't make a difference. You don't get to playthrough an aftermath, and the only consequence is different dialogue from the narrator and some different ending credit pictures.  This game had the potential to be truly epic a la Chronotrigger/Chronocross, but as soon as you decide on those dilemmas, the game's over. You're left asking for more, and feel like you just read through chapter 3 in a 10 chapter book where the author forgot to write the rest of it. The game dumps you into the middle of things, and while it gives a little backstory, you never get to make decisions in playing through it.  In a sense, the game feels like Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning in that it trades plot for action. The action is good, but not excellent. Many of the weapons are just copycats of each other with little nuances that let you trade them off. The enemy attack patterns are standard and predictable as well even though the difficulty is gradually ramped up.  Ultimately, Bastion is a solid purchase, but nothing more.

9726	0	a	game is annoying
9727	0	a	I lost my savegame one hour in. I don't care if it's steam fault or Supergiant Games' fault, somebody clearly didn't do its frakking job. This isn't a beta or day one prepatch game, for Christ sake. This game is years old. Do your job.  Good game nonetheless, but I don't care, and you shouldn't.
9728	0	a	Overrated hipster garbage. Just buy the soundtrack.
9729	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. I hate it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing controls. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Breaker's Barraks. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ trying to cycle through targets with the breaker's bow and time the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing critical shot. Target cycling? What is this PSOne? I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' rage quit this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9730	0	a	Unfortunately, I do not recommend this game. I want to like it, I really do. After reading such great reviews about the game I decided to give it a shot. I found the game to slow paced, I felt like the game wasn\'t dropping me into the action or immersive nature of the world quick enough. I am generally the kind of guy who loves fast paced games with lots of action. I did find the soundtrack quite good though for the short time I was playing it and I found the concept of a narrator telling the story of you, (The Boy) as you performed actions was very interesting.THIS IS JUST MY OPINION.
9731	0	a	Boring, repetitive, uninteresting...
9732	0	a	Thought it would be fun but it wasn't and I hate the narrators voice.
9733	0	a	Lame combat style. Challenges are too slow, enemies are boring. Can't believe this game has good reviews.  Literally the only thing that I like was the procedural dialogue that was triggered as you went through the level, thats it. Go play SNOW and get as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off at that game as this game
9734	0	a	Comes highly recommended, and the art is magnificent. Still, something about the relentless tweeness and tryhard 'I'm an art!' feel makes it very hard to get into.
9735	0	a	Really repetitive, becomes boring quickly.
9736	0	a	I could seriously fall asleep playing this boring game.
9737	0	a	While the artist style of the game is unique, the game as a whole is fairly weak.  The combat system is overly simplistic and consists solely of attack-dodge-repeat mechanics; minimalism is great, but this is barren. The variety of weapons should make the combat more interesting, but they don't because the combat system is too simple. No matter which weapon you pick, the difference will only be how far away you stand from the enemies.  The design and introduction rate of the weapons are lousy as well: you bounce from weapon to weapon quickly and upgrading weapons is pointless. Sure, you can activate idols, which makes weapon upgrades a bit more useful, but you're still stuck in the same poorly designed combat system.  The story is one of the worst I've had the displeasure of following. It's a trope-filled story narrated in a discontinuous manner with character building ripped out. The writers failed to make me care about the world or any of the characters. For imagery, think of the story as macaroni necklace: it's strung together, but not cohesive.  The 'narrative' expects you to be okay with the plot suddenly having certain elements; the turning point for me is when the line 'We became fast friends' is mentioned. This is the kind of inept story telling I'd expect of inexperienced writers, of high-school students. You can't simply say a bunch of things: there has to be connectivity between story points. Why did they become fast friends? The calamity isn't a good reason, as the direction the plot goes afterward shows. Am I to infer all of the character building, relationships and details that are not provided to me? That's not my job; the writers must do their part.  If you're looking for depth, subtlety and cohesion in a story, I'd send you to Spec Ops: The Line, not to Bastion.  The dreams are bits and pieces of back-story for each character, and they at the very least tie the macaroni necklaces into a giant ball. This is still a failing on the game's part with blame lying squarely on the writers and designers. Why weren't these things part of the main story? Why do they never come up via character interactions? All these elements that bring the main strand of story closer to something legitimate are tucked away in optional iterative-round fights. This comes off as poor design, and ultimately looks and feels lazy. It's squirrelled away; swept under the rug.  What passes for story in this game feels like bullet points for the beginning of a story idea.  To say I'm disappointed in Bastion is an understatement; it's completely forgettable.
9738	0	a	Thanks for putting all the character exposition in the midst of horrible, kick-your-â™¥â™¥â™¥ monster colloseum garbage. The game is beautiful, but not worth all this frustration and pure rage.
9739	0	a	Do not buy this game. All the normal story levels in normal difficulty aren't even challenges in any way, but all the special levels you need to do to get items to upgrade your gear and get extra abilities are hard as nails to literally impossible. The Repeater level is literally impossible to beat when you unlock it and have the best upgrades for the repeater you can get. Don't buy this game if you want to play a 'fun' game.
9740	0	a	This game is for you if you don't realize Clicker Heroes and World of Warcraft aren't the same game.
9741	0	a	
9742	0	a	the game looks great and sound good but i didnt enjoy it :( maybe i was hoping for much more
9743	0	a	Bottomline: If this one is on sale for $0.99 then get it.  The game is good and fun to play with short levels but technical issues hold it back. I have a GTX 980 Rig with 16 GB Ram. This game should run at constant 60fps. But for some reason they decided to lock it to 50. You can remove this through launch options but thats not the issue. The game lags badly every few minutes. It hits 60 fps for a few minutes and then goes to unplayable fps in the middle of a fight. I tried switching drivers. Then I decided to play this on lowest settings and finish it but apparently thats too much to ask. You cannot switch resolution through main menu. You are stuck with whatever resolution the game decides to run. When you search you will only find people asking you to use launch options.   This is an unfinished product with technical issues. If you really want to enjoy the game, buy it for PS4 if you have one. Don't bother with the PC version.
9744	0	a	While the game is quite pretty and the narration is rather clever, the combat tends to frustrate me rather than excite me.
9745	0	a	The game DOES NOT support my native resolution of 2560x1080 and needs additional time and messing around to display anything at all but a black screen. That's something you wouldn't expect from a Steam game.

9747	0	a	Boring. Shallow. Ssssh-ite!
9748	0	a	if wanna play , play another, in few minuts you dont wanna play more
9749	0	a	Really easy, overhyped game. Artwork and narrator gimmick are cool, but ultimately the game feels very stale throughout the whole experience. In both of my playthroughs, I feel that this game gives you the best two weapons pretty much at the start. So, all the other pretty useless weapons just interrupt gameplay temporarily until you can find an Arsenal and switch back to the original useful weapons. Autolock-on mechanics are sometimes useful, but later on made me wish there was an option to disable it, as countering enemies becomes more important, but more difficult without the proper controls. Overall, story was very lame for how much the narrator yammers on throughout and the gameplay was incredibly lackluster. I'd personally say skip this gaming experience in favor of other better ones that have more game to them. However, if you are all about art and presentation, then I guess you'll like this product.  Also: 'The Kid had better things to do than go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hunting, but he just couldn't resist.' PECKERS EVERYWHERE O_O
9750	0	a	Walking sideways is very annoying because you have to press TWO buttons to move in ONE direction. Most of the controls are too close together for a PC game. It becomes troublesome and irritating very fast.  The side-quests are tedious at best and boring on average.  There is no story. A thing happened that killed everyone and that is all they tell you.  The narrator is very good. Gives it a western vibe.  Gameplay is basic. Click button, bad guys die.  The art isâ€¦so-so. I donâ€™t hate it, but I donâ€™t like it. It is just kinda there. I liked the music though.  There is lots of charm to this game, but not enough practicality gameplay-wise for me to like it. 
9751	0	a	I dislike that idols are in this game. Could've been something else for the mechanic.
9752	0	a	If you don't care about 100%, this game is fantastic. However, games were meant to be completed inside and out, and half these achievements are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. You tried, Supergiant.

9756	0	a	A really good game for RPG lovers. Tactical movement , sound system and narration give a dreamy feelings.  *** But for me it crashes in the settings menu , maybe due to i am using windows 10. so i cant change any settings. *** and theres a little chance for casual players to become bored as you just go through the way and kill monsters. and you get a boss. then you do it again and again. But for rpg lovers it doesnt matter.  *** The game actually just dont worth the money . get it when its on a big sale.  overall a must buy game to pass time. but try to get it on cheap cheap price. so that you dont have to regret . *** A no from me for price , crashing on win 10 and repeatetive gameplay .  And i am applying for refund. But guys , really its not a bad game. developer did a good job.
9757	0	a	Combat is too slow, weapons feel mostly the same, and it's more about being able to roll better than fish (from nuclear throne) get nuclear throne instead, it's 100x better
9758	0	a	I don't get it. Action is slow and very limited. Last time I checked, you don't play a game for 'narration and soundtrack'. You play a game because it lures you in and is fun to play. The lure in this game should exist in a seperate forum. Maybe an animated tale instead?
9759	0	a	I can't really recommend this game. It looked fine and it received a lot of positive reviews so I expected a somehow polished one, at least; it has indeed cool graphics, decent music and the story looked not bad, but in my opinion controls are a pain and a complete mess.  I am not new in videogames, I have played plenty of them, in different platforms, since the 80's, but honestly this game is not well done and it has many issues. It's true that it's been designed with the flexibility to choose 'wasd' or 'mouse' movement. Sadly wasd movement in a game like this with this perspective is not optimal at all, and mouse movement is designed worse than bad for this game, no idea why; this is the worse 'mouse movement' implementation I have ever seen in a long long time, if not ever. Mostly unplayable with the mouse movement system if you compare it with thousands of other similar games. It's garbage.  So Bastion is better played with a gamepad (and probably it's designed for it), but even then, it looks like the game mechanics lack something badly.   For me, as I have said, the control issues â€”even if completely redefinedâ€”, make this game almost unplayable.  I have bought the game just for less than 2 bucks and I even regret it. I think it's the first time it happens to me on Steam, and I have more than 200 games, some of them costing like 10 or 15 times this price.  On balance, game looks fine, but sadly the ugly controls make it not worthy of my time. I honestly can't understand all the hype and the good reviews and critics. This game isn't even worth trying for free.
9760	0	a	I would not recommend Bastion unless it's on sale with 75% off or more. For some good reasons:  - the story is a mess, really terrible and hard to follow the plot, assuming there exists.  - poor RPG system, really minimal  - it's a repetitive task about flying from one map to other  - poor settings, there are only two degrees of difficulty  - no saving system wherever you like.  What's good?  - graphic  - music   If it's cheap, worth the money spent otherwise you could focus on something else.
9761	0	a	Rather boring
9762	0	a	It had a really unique gameplay and interaction compared most other adventure based games I've ever played. However, the plot and gameplay didn't grab me even though it's decently executed. I felt there was something missing with the game. It's good to past time but not enough to get you on the edge of your seat and play it 9 hours at a time. It actually felt like 'geez when will I reach to the end?' kinda feelings.   I think the problem with this game is that after awhile, combat seems to be a chore rather than actual fighting. You have your mouse and your keyboard to use for combating, but it didn't feel like combat at all. It felt like either destroy the mobs and spam potions or just die and start over with a different weapon. The choices of weapons were uneccessary as well, you'll find yourself not using 2/3 of the weapons you gain in the game as the stages aren't really created for weapon specific (unless you reach to the stage where you receieve the weapon). Also I find that you need to visit the shop to change weapons very inconvenient.   Overall it's an okay game, not that great to be honest. The art for it is goregous though.  5/10
9763	0	a	Aside from the soundtrack, which is amazing, this game is garbage. The story is boring, the narrator is only annoying. The graphics are alright, but the character design is inconsistent. The level design is a neat idea, but repetitive and level mechanics are inconsistent. I have no idea how it is so highly praised, aside from the fact it was made by only 7 people, but even compared to other low budget games this is just trash. But that soundtrack though.
9764	0	a	Bastion was a very slow game. As much as I tried to enjoy the game, the narration was poorly done. There was no emotion portrayed by the narrator. Gameplay and character movement lack any real substance. Awkward controls also dampen my experience with this game. Originally, I was going to give it 4/10, but the combat, artwork, and music brought the rating up to 6/10. I probably would not buy the studio's next game, Transistor.  Rating: 6/10 (60%) Achievements: 8/24 (33%) Game Done.
9765	0	a	I didn't know this was a game for children before I bought it. It's an RPG for 10 year olds.
9766	0	a	The art and music are great, but the gameplay is sorely lacking. I found that the narrator spoke too much too often, so that it felt like nothing he said mattered anymore. The game also *tells* the story instead of letting me witness or play the story. I just got bored.
9767	0	a	Overrated. The ideas are good, but the gameplay is repetitive and trivial. It's a beautiful game from a stylistic point of view.
9768	0	a	FULL OF BUGS,  nice graphics tough
9769	0	a	GAME IS GREAT ! but dont miss understand me !  GAME FULL OF BUGS ! EVERYDAY !  1) you save will be delete and u have to fix it !    2) you must change langauge that never change to english everysingle time or to ur own lanauge because for example my lanuage english everytime i login to play the lanauge turns to spanish or france cant i cant turn it back people saying u have to change lanuage from the proparties i DO but noting change it still in other lanauges and this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ME OFF !! i cant play game full of BUGS i lose all my time to fix BUGS instead of having fun developers must give a dam and fix these bugs ................   again game is good but if you're aint patient like me to waste you valuable time on fixing bugs everytime then have fun this is you game
9770	0	a	Honestly? Good artwork, somewhat interesting story, nice (but for me irritating) narration, music that's sometimes great and sometimes forgettable...but the game? The game is almost non existent. It plays worse than the average flash game, in terms of controls, variety and challenge. Even if I was almost at the end I've left it unfinished because I could not stand anymore to the lackluster gameplay mechanics. I'm extremely open minded and I like all kinds of games but this one, as a game, is not a good one. Keep in mind that Bastion has almost a cult status so saying that it's bad generates the same reaction of eating a steak in front of a vegan fundamentalist. Truth is that the only thing you do in this game is fighting (and you'll fight a lot) and the fighting part is poorly done. The interactions between your character and the enemies are floaty, there's no sense of weight nor of inflicted damage. I've almost finished it button mashing the whole time completely at random. Then I've quitted for unbearable boredom. Am I saying that Bastion is the worst game ever? Absolutely not, I just don't recommend it. Summing it up in a phrase: look over substance.
9771	0	a	Just couldn't get into it.  While Bastion is kind of hailed as one of the greats of indie gaming, I just played something that felt like an early beta. Enemies are too bullet sponge-y. The game seems to never be able to strike a balance with the narrator's dialogue, since he's either deathly quiet or never shuts up. Combat is just plain unsatisfying.   Grab it on a sale, but don't pay full price for this. It just isn't worth it.
9772	0	a	I really had to think about this one.   I bought this game about 3 years ago. Not quite sure how I found out about it. I tried to play it, but there was something about it tht I didn't like. I only made it through the first level.   I would try to pick this game up again every 6 months or so, but I just couldn't. So now, here I am with the game finished. Finally.   It starts off with a narrator speaking to you. He will talk to you for the entire game, so get used to it. Anway, he talks about some Calamity. This is the first problem with the game. The Calamity is never explained. Sure, it explains why it happened. How it happened. But not what it is. But for the entire game. the ground builds itself beneath your feet. I can't tell if that is because of the calamity or because of a gameplay element. Bad choice, either way.   So, you find a hammer and bow, fight off some weird grim reeper things, that apparently used to be workers. They aren't talked about in a more thorough way, however. Nothing in this game is. Except for where you go next. The Bastion.  I like the Bastion. I like building it as I progress through the story. But to build the bastion, you must get shards. To get shards, you have to go to different levels.  The levels are so repatative it is unexcuseable. It teases you with backstory, but of course, doesn't go any farther. After an hour fo this, I was done.   The next day, I sat down. I was going to finish this game no matter what. And I did. And now I have even more to complain about.   The backstory isn't revealed until 2/3s through the game. It feelsl tacked on. I slaved 3 hours for a tacked on story. I clicked and pressed space aimlessly for an extremely poor story about xenophobia. I wish I hadn't.  The game is repatitive, the narrator is intrusive, the story is mediocre, the gameplay is repative and boring. Sure, you get a few choices about how you want to fight. But the choices lack impact. They don't make the game feel any different.   But of course, this game is praised for it's art style and music. And that is about it. Even those don't make up for the many areas in which this game lacks.   I was going to buy Transistor. I don't think I will now.
9773	0	a	The first time I played Bastion, I loved it, even though it had some issues. Going back years later and playing it, I honestly don't remember what I liked about it. Awkward controls and just sort of boring all around. Maybe I'll revisit it again in a few years and see if my perception has changed at all.
9774	0	a	Game was pretty nice also quite short so I was able to get back to dota faster. Still I cannot recommend it since it isn't as good as Dota 2.
9775	0	a	Another completely overrated game! Waste of my money. And I spent like only 3 bucks for it.
9776	0	a	A visually beautiful and astoundingly boring game.
9777	0	a	  Bastion looks pretty nice, and it is obvious that a lot of work went into it. Well, the work went into the presentation. As a game, it is a disaster.  Just look at this: - the character moves rather sluggishly - keyboard controls are shoddy as you are moving in an isometric perspective - there is very little enemy variety - fighting mechanics are tedious and simplistic - the 'cool' narrator sounds grating rather quickly - there is absolutely no point in letting the character fall of the boundaries of the game world - pointlessly many weapons - RPG mechanics that were shoe-horned in  To me, Bastion is the epitome of the pretentious kind of indie game the mainstream video game press likes. If you want gameplay, pick a good Japanese game. Heck, not even the art is all that great, when I compare it to master pieces like Dragon's Crown.  The only good thing about Bastion is that I didn't have to pay for it.
9778	0	a	I can see why this game is so acclaimed, but it is really not for me. The pacing on world-building and story progression is excruciatingly slow - the level descriptions give you more about the world than the narrator's exposition does! While the game is extraordinarily beautiful visually and audibly and the system with weapons and drinks and so on is very interesting, I was looking for something a little more RPG-like and a little less of an action/platform crossover. Please, do go and read the positive reviews as I'm skewed by just not liking this style of gameplay rather than the game itself being bad at it, but I would suggest if you're a storyline gamer don't purchase this game - you'll go mad when you're a few hours in and still don't really know who you are, where you are, what has happened or what is expected to happen next, particularly when you spend half an hour falling off a platform or dying and you're not entirely sure what the point is of what you're doing anyway.
9779	0	a	The only interesting thing in this game is the narrator, otherwise it is an extremely boring hack and slash game.
9780	0	a	The art-style is indeed quite nice, but it simply did not entertain me. I find it rather boring from a game-play standpoint and the narration is really getting on my nerves, considering every little crap is being commentated - I don't need a commentator to tell me that I just went right - I can see that because I just done it myself. The characters hands are also so big that it's simply distracting to me.  Seeing that it's popular with most people, I guess it's mainly me, but if you aren't interested in that kind of story and if you are susceptible to being annoyed by commentary this may not be for you.
9781	0	a	A fantastic idea of a world which builds as you play, presents unusual but interesting gameplay. The soundtrack is by far the best aspect about this game. With a soundtrack version up for sale I highly recommend buying it. However, the gameplay itself does not live up to the enjoyment of other game similar to this. Yes the game is good and the narration is superb, it just doen't feel that it can maintain this enjoyment. So as you gradually persue the quest-line the quality of the missions deteriorate, making you feel as though its a chore to complete it. The combat seems to require no skill and the lack of diverse levels really create a negative influence on the rest of the game, which could really be quite something.   Pros: Great sound track. Good idea. Cons: Poorly executed gameplay and combat.  ~5.5/10~
9782	0	a	It's a 'good game' if you only look at the artwork and soundtrack. But the repetive gameplay and boring narroration just.. Doesn't cut it. I stopped right at the hub, as a matter afact because I looked at all of the paths that opened and I just.. Sighed. It felt like a chore to play this game. Save your money, don't buy it as you will waste it.  I played it for a bit more to get the trading cards to sell them.. But not too long after I threw my controler down. I couldn't stand how boring it was. It's just.. The gameplay is just that BAD. Do not buy this. Seriously. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE. Something that isn't this bad.
9783	0	a	Bastion is an example of how a game can focus too much on aesthetics and narrative at the expense of gameplay.  Reviews for this game are generally glowing but overlook just how shallow this game really is. Less than two hours in I've come to realize that there's no challenge here, and I can just run through most of the levels. This is one of those games that's probably best enjoyed as a 'let's play' unless you enjoy tedious and dull combat.
9784	0	a	I don't get what's so special about this game. Is it the gameplay? It's average at best, I've seen more exciting gameplay in Flash games. You can choose between a few weapons, walk around smashing enemies and objects. That's it.  Is it the incredibly innovative art style? Yes, that must be what everyone loves. And it's also the thing I like least about this game.  If this review is too long for you, skip the following 4 sections.   You play as some young guy called 'Kid' who drinks spirits in a saloon to gain buffs. Also, you constantly have to listen to a narrator who sounds like he comes directly out of a really cheesy spaghetti western. He has a pseudo-cool voice and a fitting accent which just gets on your nerve after a while because it's so extremely stereotyped.  Sometimes, the narration gets pushed too far. I see a collectible and without thinking I run straight to it, the floor under my feet going down. 'Kid thought twice about getting [whatever it was]', the narrator says. Wait, what? Sure, you can comment what's happening, but when I'm controlling a characterless guy such as Kid who is only defined by my own actions, you can't just act like what's on his - on MY - mind.  But let's get back to the art style. Alright, I could live with that cheesy spaghetti western feeling. But the game takes place in an extremely colorful fantasy world. You have these bright colors, carry a bright red oversized hammer while walking through the bright green grass, fighting comical enemies. And in the background, you hear that narrator with that deep voice, telling you how bad everything is and how screwed you are. Seriously, this feels like Teletubbies suffering from depression. And if this wasn't already unfitting enough, the developers had to push it even more and add some weird oriental trip hop soundtrack which fits neither to the western setting nor to the fantasy setting.  Well, as it's neither the gameplay nor the art design which makes the game exciting for me, maybe the story is good. Let's take a look: The world is ending. Kid has to collect some crystals to rebuild a monument in order to save the world. Not special, but not bad - yet. During his journey he finds some nice survivors who then live in your homestead. After about 30 minutes you collect the last of the few crystals, but suddenly, absolutely incredible unexpected plot twist: One of those nice survivors gets into an argument and in his rage he destroys the monument which ultimately seals the end of the world. Seriously, what the hell? Did the developers go out of ideas? This is by far the most illogical action of any character I've ever seen. So, instead of collecting 5 crystals, Kid is now supposed to collect 20 crystal shards.   I stopped playing after collecting the fifth shard because the game just didn't change. The story didn't progress any further, the gameplay stayed the same, the narration was still annoying, Kid still lacked character.  Innovation can be good, but instead of focussing on a good idea Bastion is just a mixture of multiple incoherent art styles with average gameplay.
9785	0	a	This is a game that sold itself on a narrator and an art style. So yes, it looks pretty, just not in motion. The Kid, the character who will almost always be on screen, is clearly lower quality than everyone and everything else. The sound quality isn't that great either. It's certainly above average for most games, but nothing will stick with you from any part of the game I played. I didn't bother finishing this game. I tried to like it and it just kept spitting in my face.  The combat is just so dull. It's slow and unsatisfying. The game gives you a great variety of weapons to choose from, and upgrade. You set out for a mission with the idea that your loadout and the different ways the weapons and abilities work is how you want to play, except the game doesn't care what you chose because the game REALLY wants you to try out this new weapon and won't let you continue without picking it up. It says 'I don't care how you wanna play. You're using this un-upgraded, unfamiliar weapon until I say so.' So the way you decided to play gets thrown out the window because the game doesn't care about what you want. It's all tell and no show. The enemy variety, art-wise is very low. Enemy art is reused and recolored to show different behaviors, except you'll never learn them unless they just spawn behind you a whole bunch or you get an actually interesting and large battle. Most of the time you see the ground form up or a box drop from the sky and you can just destroy them from afar. For the first few levels this isn't so bad. Once you get to the swamps it gets much worse. I made it to the point where you got the fire billows, another lackluster weapon, crammed down your throat. The enemies at this point were a bunch of plants that just sit there and spray you with near constant streams of projectiles, sometimes birds pop up and bug you too. There has yet to be a good boss fight in this game. Don't buy this. Don't play this, it isn't fun. If you really like the sound track, just go pirate it.
9786	0	a	my 3rd party controller doesnt work on this game. seems to work on all my others.
9787	0	a	Simple and ripetitive gameplay. Boring game with nice art and worthless plot.
9788	0	a	I love the game but; 1. projectile going through targets 2. aiming is off  Fix it please. Until then i have to give this a thumbs down.   Edit:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296150325   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296325843   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296324585   TL;DR guy can't aim for his life.
9789	0	a	I really wanted to like this but I just don't. Not sure why, but when I finally got to that mission hub and all the paths opened up I was like '*sigh* do I have to play all these?' Just feels like a chore for some reason.
9790	0	a	I always was quite sceptic if this type of games - asian console Zelda-like games - was my cup of tea. As Bastion was received so positively, I gave it a try at a Steam sales. Graphics &amp; music are quite pretty &amp; colorful. Almost everything is destructible and some weapon/skill customization is available, but bad skill choices of my part, repetive and sometimes hard frenetic gameplay &amp; problems with correct aiming kept me from restarting the whole thing.  If you like games that have a resemblance of console games, this will be a mostly game for you. For those that were never in console games at all, you can try this one but be aware that it can turn out to be a disappointment.  So I am sorry it's Bastion for this type of games to be the one to get negative feedback from me, but it couldn't grab my interest for long. It didn't connect.
9791	0	a	the only thing more annoying than the MEH level of gameplay, is the PAINFUL to the point of making your EARS BLEED narration.  seriously of all the voice actors in the world they went with THAT???? 
9792	0	a	Bastionâ€™s only thing going for it is itâ€™s superficial artistic matter which it doesn't really have in the long rune, it's soundtrack is really dull and sounds like the type of stuff you would hear from a russian flash animated mmorpg (which it's art style also reminds me of) the gameplay is too slow and sluggish and itâ€™s out there for me as one of the worst isometric shooters in a while due to the fact of how BORING it is. Again, a game I was happy to get out in the long run more money from selling it's cards in terms of profit. The 1 dollar was definetely not worth it.
9793	0	a	The art is nice, gameplay is decent, world makes no sense and overall the game is too linear for me to enjoy. Also the narrator becomes grating very fast.
9794	0	a	The art is very good and the story is interesting, but it's not a very good game. It's like the bad brother of Ys, gameplay- and combat-wise. If you are interested in a good action-RPG in a fantasy world you should check Ys: Oath in Felghana or Ys Origin, they are far better than Bastion.  http://store.steampowered.com/app/207320/   http://store.steampowered.com/app/207350/

9796	0	a	I've never seen a game fail so many cases of basic design, and each one left me wondering either what I was expected to do or what the ramification of my actions were. It starts off w/your very first move in the game. With no hint at all of what you're supposed to do first, you're expected to make the leap that even though you're on your back apparently sleeping you should just move and you'll wake up. Another example rears its head when you start to move: the world is isometric, but movement is not and I couldn't find a way to change that (at least not in settings). What this means is that your movement is never aligned with the basic directions of the level...you have to combine two movement inputs instead (forward diagonal left and right combined to move forward). That's normally not a big deal, except this game's level design expects you to avoid areas that cause you to die. As a result, you wind up having to use magical combinations of movement direction input to navigate past places you'll fall and die over. And the problem with dying is that you're told when you start a new game and pick a difficulty that if you don't choose 'normal' which has limited lives you'll miss out on achievements...which leads at least me to believe that dying has a consequence. That consequence was never communicated to me.  The menu system suffers the same problem: there are regions delineated as buttons, but you can't just press them anywhere in the region (like you could the physical analog they're crafted after for the ironic purpose of making interaction easier to understand), you have to press on the *letters* on the buttons. Worse, there's no feedback or hints to tell you this. Once again, you have to spend unintended effort/time learning this and then dealing with the aggravation.  The same thing happens with navigation and determining what to do next. I spent five minutes in the Bastion lost because the visual cues and narration point you at the travel kiosk at the top of the area while telling you to build something. Naturally I assumed the visual cues were telling me to build something on the travel kiosk's black circle. I died three times falling off the edge instead. Then I wandered around, and the combination of this and the character's slow movement speed ramped up the aggravation meter even more and highlighted another design flaw: when you restrict movement speed you need to design level spatial layout to accomodate (design things sufficiently close together to prevent the character from spending unnecessary amounts of time just jogging around). Finally after watching my character jog around for a few minutes and getting bored I noticed the two places on the opposite bottom left side of the area where I was actually expected to build something. The visual cues given pointed me in the exact opposite direction of this. The mistake was so obvious and led to enough time spent lost I started to wonder if the game's designers understood that their game might eventually be played by a human.  Here, I'll break it down to the simplest--if you decide to take on the task of entertaining someone else, and you choose a dynamic medium like games, you take on the responsibility of being a thoughtful and considerate host. At any time that you do not, you risk forcing them to feel their time is being wasted, their basic needs aren't being considered, and the host's concern over any of this can even come into question to varying degrees and amounts along the way. I ran into another case of this just exiting out of the game partway through the first level. With no indication of when your game is saved, when I restarted it forced me to start a new game over, leading me to believe it hadn't saved any of my progress. That led to more time spent watching the beautifully rendered character...jog. Not my idea of fun, and something that inconvenient made me wonder if the game's devs cared much about the player's experience.  This kind of thing leads to unnecessary aggravation at least, but it usually leads to just plain â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games. When I encounter more than a handful of these instances in the 1st level of a game (there were more I lost patience noting here), I lose the desire to continue. Pretty backgrounds and music don't help here, and you'd think things like enough great retro low pixel games would have clued someone into this.  There might be a decent game hidden somewhere past Bastion's first level. Problem is, it was such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ host for the 1st level that I'm not sure I care to risk more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iness to find out.
9797	0	a	It looked like a cool game, but the gameplay is just a bunch of button mashing. It's difficult but the only thing you can really do to be better is click faster. I didn't think there was much story to the game (which is what I originally thought there was going to be) .   Overall, good game, but its just not for me.
9798	0	a	Controls feel sluggish. I didn't like the environment constantly raising into place, it's very distracting. Hard to spot your character on screen sometimes when surrounded by lots of little enemies.
9799	0	a	Bastion was one of those games that you look forward to sit down and play. So when it was X-BOX controller ONLY compatible....  A shame. A dirty rotten shamful lie to say it's fully controller compatible.  Some of us like to PC on the couch and Bastion was supposed to be my new companion.  Maybe one day the gods will gift me with a Windows manufactured and owned controller. Until then? Can't rate a game I was going to spend on the sofa. 'Full Controller Support' my foot.
9800	0	a	Pretentious â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9801	0	a	Boring shallow gameplay uninteresting story graphics aren't bad oh but theres a narrator 10/10 goty
9802	0	a	its to short...
9803	0	a	0/10 boring gameplay and the storyteller is annoying as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9804	0	a	It's a decent game. I don't recommend it.
9805	0	a	Overrated. Didn't enjoy the gameplay one bit, found it very boring. Sountrack was nice but the art style and story failed to captivate me. Seems like something you'd play on an Ipad or other mobile device when you're bored on a road trip.
9806	0	a	If you want to experience 'Bastion' save yourself the money and just play 'Spiral Knights' while having a friend narrate everything you do in a faux Ron Perlman/Tom Waits voice, occasionally stopping to play a Cat Power song on your CD player. That would about sum it up. It's really not so much a game as it is a kind of neat gimmick (i.e. the voice over) tacked on to the most mediocre ARPG ever created. Of course the typical formula for an indie game these days is 'retro gameplay + a gimmick = success' and there are much worse games (and, indeed, much worse gimmicks) out there than 'Bastion.' But I really can't think of another game that is more grossly overrated than 'Bastion' is. Once the novelty of the voice over wears off it really doesn't have much which would distinguish it from the literally scores of free-to-play, browser based, ARPGs out there (except, maybe, the backstory which is, by turns, both half baked and over wrought). Don't see what the fuss was about with this one.
9807	0	a	I don't really know what it is. I really wanted to like this game, and really looked forward to have it ...  I think first and foremost they f*cked up the controls. It just doesn't feel right and I tried with keyboard and XBox Controller.  Second is that nearly every time I want to play this game I have to check the gamefiles integrity because it just won't boot up at the first try. Then a small file is downloaded and after that it runs fine.  Third is that it just gets boring and repetitive. And furthermore as soon as you finally found out what weapon suits you well the game takes the weapon away at the beginning of the next mission so the only thing you can really play with the setup you like to is that damn dream sequence over and over and over and over and over and over and over (and maybe even more) again.  There is so damn much done right in this game that I nearly hate myself for doing so but I, personally, can't recommend this game.  The one thing that's really great about this game though is it's soundtrack and the art design. The OST can be bought seperately. Maybe you should go for that instead of buying the whole thing because the artdesign you can see on the screenshots and in the videos ...  @ngel
9808	0	a	I don't reccomend this game simply because it is too short and not what everyone led me to believe it would be. The controls on pc are clunky so unless you have an Xbox controller you will fall off the egde. It has very little re playability for a game with such a short campaign. I found the narrator annoying. Visuals are ok but overall its nothe rdecent indie game. don't believe the hype.
9809	0	a	Bastion is an interesting take on an isometric hack and slash where everything everywhere is floating, and therefore, almost everywhere is a pit.  The art is good, the narrator is good, the animations aren't bad...  I like isometric hack and slash.   I can't stand this game.    Thankfully the dev added 'windbag ranch' near the beginning so I can stop playing, write this review, and delete the game.  Your character has tiny little arms and legs, so he moves like an anthropomorphic turtle.  In order to move faster, you must roll... but rolling is hard to control. Did I mention pits?  Windbag ranch is an arena for learning the 4th weapon of the game - a sword. The arena is surrounded by monster spawners and turrets, the only weapon you can use is the sword. Three turrets are floating outside the arena. You must kill all the monsters within 60 seconds. The monsters can fly, and half of them  run away from you...   You can't kill them without throwing your sword at them (unless there's some way to fly coming later on. I doubt that) Throwing your sword takes about 1-2 seconds, and of course it's a slow projectile... so it typically misses at range. Add to this that you have to aim for the enemy's shadow to hit their body. Add to this that you are slower than they are. Add to this that it's not always clear whether you can walk on a spot or fall ... and did I mention that there are three spawners for these monsters?  If you kill the spawners the monsters will have time to scatter - you'll never kill them all in 3 minutes if this happens. If you don't kill the spawners... the monsters never stop spawning...  I can understand super frustrating end game challenges like chocobo racing to obtain the best sword in FF10. This is a XP grind / training arena, and everytime I fail it I must  - shuffle over to the reset button   &gt;confirm reset&lt;  - watch the entire training area intro animations...  One of the levels is made almost entirely of falling platforms - there was an area I couldn't get to because as soon as went the wrong direction I couldn't go back.   This is the model for the entire game - pits and resets.  I haven't even heard enough of the story to know why I'm gathering crystals...  I'm glad the developer put windbag ranch in the game early - It probably saved me a few hours attempting to play this game.  Bastion is perhaps a very good game.   I can't stand it. Playing it is frustrating and slow for reasons I hate.
9810	0	a	this game isnt very great.
9811	0	a	It's an ok hipster time-waster but pretty boring. Click on things until they die. Sometimes you upgrade your weapon so you don't have to click as much. Nice art and music.  I don't know why it gets such high praise.
9812	0	a	This game is just copy paste from the Japanese 'Children of Mana' for nintendo DS, wich was serious, hard, and you could understand what you were doing.  On it this wonderful piece of being hipster has some pretty annoying graphics that look made from some disturbed Deviantart Queen beside of drawing some damn Ponies humping one on the other. Everything is coated with some awful wannabe Diablo music, but still for the whole family, so that even the dog can apreciate it. The worst thing remains the story teller, that just tells what you are doing every 2 seconds, and makes me yell to my poor laptop 'DAMN MAN I KNOW WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING', I never found Navi annoying on ocarina of time, but this... this kills me.  So now I go back to some serious games and won't care anymore about this deviantart sweetie hipster â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9813	0	a	I know I'm in the minority here by a long shot, but this game is not at all what I expected and the narration that is so highly touted gets on your nerves about 40 seconds into the game. The quaint WASD controls may have worked if the game didn't force you to go in weird directions that require odd combinations of WASD to even go in the right direction. The 'RPG' aspect of the game is on life support as well. After playing all of 5 minutes (despite it oddly saying '46' minutes) I requested a refund when it was on sale for $3.64. I do not even read the responses to my reviews so don't bother. It's my opinion and there are no wrong answers as such...
9814	0	a	Like seriously it actually got worse the longer it went on
9815	0	a	so far up its own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it needs colon irigation to save it
9816	0	a	In what â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ parallel universe does this crap deserve such a high user rating. You â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing victims make me sick. Get a life, losers.
9817	0	a	The controls for combat are a pain to use and i was just bored as hell while playing.
9818	0	a	This game's made me lose faith in game critics, I've tried hard to see what the appeal is. I'll try and break it down to see if I'm missing something:   So we have a game mechanic that involves you controlling a character from a third person view using point and click interactions to interact with the environment. Doesn't seem too original to me, I've played many many games that use that same mechanic, to me it's boring to others it might be new.  So what else do we have; the storyline; post-apocalyptic. Trying to rebuild the world. There was a war. Again it's not really original enough for me, fair enough if you've not heard that story before then it might be intriguing, not for me though.  The sound - music is nice I wouldn't class it as critically acclaimed but fits the mood of the game and is varied enough to not bore me. The narration for me is probably the nicest feature, it makes the game a lot more immersive, the voice acting spot on.   Graphic assets; they look OK, they have their own style and feel, environment feels slightly dream-like not sure how that connects with any of the other aspects of the game though.  Can't think of much more to assess, am I missing something? My conclusion is that we have an over-used game mechanic combined with an over-used story but with a half decent soundtrack and a novel way of narrating a computer game. Problem is you can't rate a game on the narrator it's like reviewing a restaurant based on the quality of the plates.
9819	0	a	Quite overrated. Theres nothing really 'new' in this game. Good graphics. Soundtracks which this game seemed to boast to is not that amazing, personally - it's just doesnt sound too rpg'sh  One thing I'm irritated with this game is the narration. The ebonics style narration. I am so sorry if this sounds racist somewhat but this style of narration is not suited for RPGs please. Logan Cunningham has a beautiful and clear voice but I simply didnt like the style. It simply breaks the immersion and the lore it tries to establish.
9820	0	a	it's meh.. i pushed hard to finish only for the sake of it. combat was boring and story wasn't ground-breaking either.
9821	0	a	The game demands a 360 controller (gross). I got it one and it absolutely failed to detect it. I'm sure it's a neat game, but this was a horrible start. A horrible start in a world with a million kabillion games I have available to play. So, SORRY BASTION - I have no time for your horseapples.
9822	0	a	simply one of the greatest FPSs of our time
9823	0	a	I know it's a very unpopular opinion, but this game uses (although beautiful) visuals and a narrator with a soothing voice (which I'll get back later) to muster the fact that the gameplay is nothing at all special. It's bland and repetetive, and just not at all fun. A lot of people went crazy for this game back when it came out, back when quality inde games were much less common. Indie games simply never looked this good, and people were really just blinded by that fact alone to pay attention to the fact that the game simply isnt much fun. Now, that narrator- praised by the massses as one of this games major, unique, selling points, was something I couldn't stand. Having a voice tell you about everything going on made it feel like a non-stop tutorial level, and I had to mute it after awhile. It's a pretty game, and far from the worst I've ever played, but it's just not a whole lot of fun. Not a bad game, but not worth your time over some of the indie masterpieces out there.
9824	0	a	It's fun, and I really like it, but I like to collect everyhing I can just becasue, insidentally this game is very hard in that respect, as you are frequently presented with off the beaten trail locations to test your skill and to get items. I stopped playing for this very reason, it's incredably frustrating and time consuming to get down exactly what to do perfectly becasue they expect you to be perfect at it, thus my own instinctual drive to explore and gather everyhting I can for postarity is commonly met with heavy resistance making me quite discouraged and uninterested in finishing the main game as I like to turn over every stone before moving on so I never need to go back. The regular game is great though, that's a ten out of ten, it's just if you like exploring and gathering everything you can you should also be increadly bullheaded to withstand the wall of failure that will hold you back, or only play for the story, or just be naturally talanted at the game, which apparently I am not.
9825	0	a	Boring gameplay, Horrible narration. Extremely overrated.  Also could someone who is downvoting me tell me what is fun at mashing a button to see enemies die, and then pressing another button when your health is low. In a game that has almost no story, and the main character has no personality and is constantly being called a 'kid' by a narrator who has a horrible american accent that does not fit it the theme of this game at all.
9826	0	a	Wow a man is commentating everything I do! Better give it 10/10 even if it's a mediocre game.
9827	0	a	this game is cute and inventive but the narrator is lamer than all hell and the core gameplay wasnt deep enough to keep me going
9828	0	a	There just isn't enough content. I played through the entire game twice and then didn't know what else to do.
9829	0	a	Linear, Repetitive, Bad Story. Narrator is dam annoying too. I guess I expected more from this game given its reviews. It just does not stack up.
9830	0	a	it is not bad, it is just not for my taste   NEUTRAL
9831	0	a	It's gorgeous and terribly, terribly overrated. And then a few hours in, the game lost all of my saved progress and after the rage subsided I realized that I didn't even care.
9832	0	a	Finished the storyline in about 6 hours of gameplay. I found the game to be pretty difficult to get the hang of, and with not much replay value. The artwork and story are really pretty, though.
9833	0	a	I did not find the story engaging. The way in which the story was narrated was exciting and new, but that wasn't enough to redeem the weak plot. From a gameplay standpoint, Bastion is little more than a button mashing festival of boredom.
9834	0	a	Terrible game, repetitive, boring and the damned fang repeater doesn't shoot where you're aiming depending on where you're pointed, making the challenge for it near impossible. Do not buy.
9835	0	a	If you can't get invested in the story or narration device, then this game doesn't really offer much.
9836	0	a	Stare at an Salvador Dali painting. Now read a Tolkien book (just parts of it). What would happen if the two works of art come together? Say, Dali painted a scene from the Lord of the Rings series? Or if Tolkien could put in words a Dali painting? Give either concept the most basic of Action RPG mechanics, with a old west kind of sound track and BAM, you just made Bastion. One would think that two great masters of different mediums working together on the same project would create a stellar result. Few times, it works, but more often, it does not; Bastion is the latter.   Gameplay: The gameplay is basic, nothing more. It uses standard action RPG mechanics played on an isometric map. Like a lesser Zelda game. The weapons are broken, favoring all ranged weapons. I know that there are those that prefer melee, but it is pointless when a fully upgraded shotgun or blowgun can cut down anything and everything. The weapon challenge mode can easily be exploited. An endurance challenge can be fun in early gameplay but when a myriad of perked up ranged weapons are used, they become pointless. The difficulty can be adjusted to give more of a challenge. But this is pointless when a game should have natural challenges inherent to each enemy and enemy type. The payoff is adding a percent increase to currency and XP which can be beneficial from early to mid game, but becomes pointless end game. The dodge mechanic is similar to jumping in Portal: it can be used for its intention, but its just a faster mode of transportation as the Kidâ€™s runs painfully slow. One interesting feature was how the narrator, Ruckus, sometimes narrates the actions the Kid makes, like rolling too often, destroying scenery pieces, defeating a boss, etcâ€¦ It is a unique quirk that gave it some depth, and could have made the story much better, but itâ€™s noting too special. Rather than using traditional RPG character stat leveling, Bastion uses weapons upgrades and a perk system. All of the perks, stats, weapons, upgrades and currency carry over in New Game+. This makes pointless gameplay even more pointless.  Rather than standing up to the big time RPG's, the game takes a safe approach. It feels more like 'baby's first RPG.'  Story:  The world of Bastion can summarize the whole story; it is a pretty world that feels loose and is fabricated on the spot but has no real understanding about whatâ€™s under the Kids feet. In the world of Bastion, an event called the Calamity happened which reduced the nation of Caelondia (but I presume a world) to a series of floating islands in the sky. Now the player, the Kid, has to piece together the remains of the world in hopes to saveâ€¦ something; the Bastion, probably. Itâ€™s really cryptic and really has no grounding. If you are going to destroy a city or world, then it would help to have some context as to what is being destroyed. The game is centered on rebuilding the Bastion by collecting crystals that restore buildings to their former state and finding any survivors. And because of this lack of context, there wasnâ€™t any sense of urgency. Reading the Wikipedia gave more story than what was delivered. But whatâ€™s even worse, is a (spoiler) moral choice ending. Itâ€™s kind of hard to make a moral choice when there is nothing to compare it too. The whole story is told though the perspective of the narrator called Ruckus. It is an interesting narrative method for games. The story felt as if someone is sitting down and telling player a story. However, there is little disposition to character depth, world settings, and overall no relations other than with Ruckus. After all it is told from his perspective so it feels appropriate to him. This would make a good story to read, or listen to, or watch as an animation. it does serve itâ€™s purpose. The flip side to this is that there is a level of disconnect with the Kid. The player is watching the Kidâ€™s actions while being told a story along the way. The story might make sense in Ruckus' head, but it doesn't translate very well.  As a whole, the story is forgetful. It involves a lot of piecing together what lead up to the Calamity. Itâ€™s a post apocalypse, centered on a world that really has no reason to exist. Itâ€™s hard to save something when you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re saving.   Art: The art of Bastion is one of its, both in sound and artwork. The sound track is somewhat of a hybrid of folk music with and old west. The artwork has a very vibrant pastel appearance that brings a softness to the world. The music fits with the tone of the world, but the artwork clashes too much with the gameplay. The music is nothing spectacular. It does what music is suppose to do in a game, set the tone. It does a good job of setting a soft tone and has the feeling of sitting around a campfire. The music is combines well with the gameplay and story. The sound effects have an unusual and other world sound which makes it unique to the game itself. There could have been more variety of sound effects to distinguish between some enemy types, but this is only a small part.  The artwork is bright, colorful, and very detailed. Like the music, the artwork is also designed to set the tone of the game. However, this artwork clashes with the game too often. Having the floor build under the player is no different than lighting a preset corridor. The Kid can fall off the edges but not on the sections being built. Too often the borders are vague and clashing or the holes in the floor are small and hard to see when fighting in a fast paced battle. Paths can feel vague and unknown even though they are prebuilt to â€œlight the way.â€ Buildings and structures have a shanty town appearance that feel like Megaton in Fallout 3 with a vibrant paint job. If this is a post apocalyptic world, then it doesnâ€™t appear that way. If this is a western, itâ€™s too green and vibrant. Many of the enemies blend too well with the environment and it can be difficult to detect where the attack is coming from. The Bastionâ€™s art work should have taken much more of a minimalistic approach to designing the game that could match the gameplay and or story. Bastionâ€™s sound is good for setting the tone but it is not worth listening to on an MP3. The artwork is too much and too colorful to create an effective setting and world. On the surface it carries the appearance of a bright colorful world with a simple story like with a Mario game or Zelda: Wind Waker. But to use their color and design choices to tell a story in a post-apocalypse setting really does not do it justice.   The Bastion could be best summarized by eating a homemade sandwich at work. The gameplay is like store bough deli meats, with regular cheese, maybe tomato and lettuce, and a hint of pepper with a light mayonnaise. The artwork is equal to having handcrafted artisans bread that has a unique flavor and texture. It might have some variety and looks pretty, it might taste different, and others may call it the best tasting sandwich ever, but all it can do is satisfy the hunger to get though the day. Eat this sandwich along with hearing some slow western country song while the old raspy co-worker tells a story, and that is the experience of playing the Bastion. It is a treat for some but not for those looking for more substance.   
9837	0	a	the gimmicks are eventually bogged down by overly simplistic gameplay and repetitive environments, leading to what can only be described as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game design.
9838	0	a	I appreciate what they tried to do. I think a stronger storyline and connection with the characters could have made this something special.

9842	0	a	I've got mixed feelings on Bastion.... The story is fleshed out and paced very well, the graphics look great, and the soundtrack is amazing.... The gameplay was just too fast paced and chaotic for me, and in the end kept me from finishing the game even though I was only a couple hours away from beating it.. Ofcourse, if you enjoy fast combat and dodging and blocking a million things on screen then you'll probably like Bastion, but personally I cannot recommend the game.
9843	0	a	Probably, nobody will agree with me, but I frikin HATE THIS GAME!  Yes, the visuals are very nice. But this is the only point I liked about this game. The gameplay is way too slow, you are forced to dogderoll all the time to get moving. Which is risky, cause you'll probably fall off the edge and lose more time. While fighting you are always limited to those small panels and ways, which pop up to slow sometimes.  There is no real difference in all the weapons you can unlock, same with encountered enemies, except bosses. It's either flailing or charge shooting, whatever. I got nightmares from the music, it's so dang repetitive.  For me as a german, with subtitles for the narrator, he becomes annoying as well. His english is advanced and a bit mumbled, you are forced to read the subtitles to know what's going on. But when you do, you are gettin whacked by monsters.  It was interessting in the beginning, but got very annoying very quick.  I can understand why many people like this game, but Geezus, I frikin hate it.
9844	0	a	The most boring and tedious game I've ever played.
9845	0	a	I'm only listing the cons  Cons:$15 asking price,no replay value,because you HAVE to start another save,Weird controls.

9848	0	a	Sam Elliot won't stop talking. I think my game is broken.  Just buy the soundtrack. what a dull game.  I got the black screen error. Thanks SuperGiant! Nice to know you care enough about your game to not fix a very prevalent bug.  this game won a ton of awards for copying the villain structure of a game from 1992.
9849	0	a	The kid got real tired of my monotone voice and lazy gameplay after a while. The kid uninstalled, but kept the soundtrack.
9850	0	a	pretentious indy garbage
9851	0	a	Got the game on sale and was expecting fantastic gameplay like something from Dust: Elysium, but the game seems centered around art more than actual playing. Even the story wasn't that fantastic -- the whole story seems choppy from the start without any real background or progression. If you want a game that has beautiful art and a pretty good soundtrack then you might like this, but if you want a game with amazing gameplay and a really deep story, then this probably isn't for you.
9852	0	a	I cant describe how much i hate this, he just gets POTG for holding m1 and killing 2 people and then he shoots me down before i can get the 3 rockets off to get him out of that stupid sentry mode
9853	0	a	I love the music, I love the art style, I love the narrative. I HATE THE CONTROLS. I...I can't enjoy a run and gun that doesn't have at least tight 2D field of view. 3/4 view is Landstaker madness from the Genesis days. NO. NO.
9854	0	a	I can't find the fun in this game. Annoying voice over. To be honest, growing sick of gaming. Probably a biased thumbs down. I will keep trying, but so far not enjoying this game.
9855	0	a	I found the whole experience slow, bland and over rated. Watching the credits is hilarious its 15 people that actually worked on the game and then 15 minutes of WB executives.
9856	0	a	I thought this game was going to be like a proper fantasy title not some fantasy mixed in with some wild west themed stuff. It just wasn't what I expected it to be.   The soundtrack does nothing for me and the narrator is just annoying as hell. 'The kid this and the kid that'. I can see why some people might like it but it just didn't hit the nail on the head for me. A little kid who is able to swing around a hammer and the western theme just doesn't appeal to me.  In fact, the only thing I liked is the art style which is quite pretty.
9857	0	a	I did not understand why this game was so praised when I played it. People called Bastion a gorgeous game with a very unique narration, but I honestly didn't think this game brought anything truly new and innovative to gaming or storytelling. It's actually a typical, linear action/RPG-esque game with a slightly retro feel, some good but repetitive music and a story that hasn't really impressed me.  Bastion is a good game, but I didn't understand why it was hyped and, despite my numerous attempts, I was simply never able to finish it and got bored about halfway through. I just found the gameplay very repetitive : you basically click on everything that moves until it dies in a typical action-RPG fashion, except you don't have the loot, gold or rewards that make these games so addicting. Combat just wasn't satisfying and was often a matter of mashing Mouse1 and blocking once every five seconds before repeating until the monster/boss was down. Challenge levels are more frustrating than they are challenging and the special gear you find in these levels isn't very useful or fun to use because it often simply gives you more ways to kill enemies you could already easily kill with your hammer by left-clicking them to death.  It's unique in its visual presentation, but in my opinion, the game's originality ends there, and it does not compensate for its lackluster gameplay.
9858	0	a	Boring
9859	0	a	The isometric perspective bugs me in this. Gameplay also just seems kind of simple. This game didn't pique my interest, but I didn't spend much time with it so maybe I missed out on something. Or maybe I'm just crazy :P
9860	0	a	While the Narration is pleasing to the ear and the visuals are nice, the actual gameplay elements are just plain lackluster. If I hadn't gotten this for $1 in a Humble Bundle, I would feel like I overpaid.
9861	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Like, the graphics are horrible. They look like they were hand painted. I mean, who the hell wants that in a game! Also, the music is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's like. Acoustic guitars, and junk. WHO THE HELL CARES ABOUT GRANDPA MUSIC, I MEAN, JESUS. WHY DIDN'T SKRILLEX DO THE SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS! My biggest complaint is the gameplay. You can't get any 360 420 quickscope noscope breast enhancemends, and I can't make half-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ montages about it.  In total, I'll give this game a 10/10, for being utterly beautiful in all the right ways, and being something unique. I love it very muchly.
9862	0	a	I have one of the newer Retina MacBook Pros and Bastion does not work on it. I have contacted SuperGiant Games and they have not given me any kind of solution to the problem.   This is apparently not an uncommon problem. Buy at your own risk.
9863	0	a	The design of the whole thing is a bit childish, but the drama has some strong undercurrents, and the gameplay is slick. It's a fun adventure to play through, though nothing to write home about.
9864	0	a	A pretty hack and slash game with unique concepts, but with awkard fighting mechanics. Not recommended unless you are really into hack and slash type games.
9865	0	a	I recommend staying AWAY from Bastion. â—â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬à®œÛ©ÛžÛ©à®œâ–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â—  Ã—Â°Ã—â˜…Summary Reviewâ˜…Ã—Â°Ã— Overall Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜† [2/5] Story: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† Gameplay: â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† Sound: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† â—â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬à®œÛ©ÛžÛ©à®œâ–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â— THE BAD: This game fails at what could have been epic. Fighting the mechanics is tougher than fighting the monsters. And good god, I haven't seen such rock VS paper weapon mechanics since my old days of Pokemon. Each mob has a specific gymic which is not challenging, just annoying while also slowing down combat most of the time. Others it's so mindlessly easy it's like cutting thru cord-wood. Even the easy mode is most annoying.  THEGOOD: The narrator did a great job. And the music is good....what you're expecting more?
9866	0	a	Not very hard game, must be for the younger folk.
9867	0	a	Style over substance. The game-play felt cumbersome and limited. The visuals were interesting but unoriginal. Only things of merit were the soundtrack and narration. But they are not enough to make the game worth playing.
9868	0	a	Hated it. The story didn't appeal to me, nor did the character development. Narration was annoying. Didn't like the floating world. The last straw was the 'Machete Level.' Completely useless targeting system. Uninstalled. I just bought it for the soundtrack; wish I would have saved the extra $5 and skipped the game.
9869	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME  so yeah i forgot to update this after i played it... basically it's a really mediocre game where some guy with a deep voice tries to distract you from how bad it is by talking a lot
9870	0	a	I'm sorry but I don't know what the fuss is about.  That being said the soundtrack is phenomenal.
9871	0	a	I heard a lot praise about this game, and whilst being a very avid RPG fan, I thought I'd try it out. I was a bit disappointed really.   I admit the game is very beautiful, well designed, but I didn't really enjoy the gameplay, the weapons all felt a bit awkward and the combat a bit disjointed, the town feature felt pointless with upgrading and expanding it, and you basically just romp through the levels hitting stuff and jumping about whilst some guy narrates it all.   The game is incredibly easy in terms of the story and takes less than 4 hours to complete, even though there are much harder challenges through the use of Idols and a newgame+, it feels way too manufactured or forced in terms of difficulty, rather than a challenge that's fun to beat.
9872	0	a	The name of this title should be changed to 'The Kid' cliche'. Used extensively to the point of pure irritation. For me that just ruined it. It's repetitive and gets stale quickly. A lot of others like it and that's great. Just not for me.
9873	0	a	This game is boring, stop being smelly homo hipsters
9874	0	a	VERY over rated brawler, yeah it looks nice but the gameplay is shallow and the whole game is pretty boring. its not a very good brawler or shooter and if it didnt have that 'OMG its an indie game! thats SOOOO deep' it wouldnt have been half a poular than it is. Just another good looking piece of indie crap
9875	0	a	The feeling you get when you complete Bastion is one of relief. You are so over joyed that the terrible game is over and you can uninstall it and play something half decent.  This Game is only enjoyed by the biggest of Cucks.
9876	0	a	Dont like this game at all heres why:  -game is just extremely colorfull, u want just to puke after few minutes of play, its like game for very little kids 3-6 years old  -the commentator, he tell your story in western movie style and its the most annoying and boring thing ever, he tell that u fight scumbags and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, and those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s are little fluffy blue creatures LOL   -and last its the combat, its a 2D game but its presented as if u play 3D, its very unclean, also all rpg elements are boring  So i dont recomend this game, not if u are older then 6.
9877	0	a	
9878	0	a	I can't say I really liked this game. There was something about the Narrator that was really grinding my gears. It's either you love it or you hate it, I guess.  The presentation and graphics were nice, but I found the gameplay to be chaotic very often, to the point where it was simply not fun at all.
9879	0	a	Should be cool for kids but not for grown ups ...
9880	0	a	I don't really know why but bastion is a game that looks awesome, I love the art, the game type, everything. However, I simply can't get myself to like this game, probably because there's that strange voice in the background that I really hate...  For me, this game is missing Multiplayer. I would play this game if it had some co-up options but it has nothing and I find that a bit sad. The universe is as I said before, really nice and beautiful. There are a few bugs when mapping powers though and I was actually quite annoyed by that.  I don't see really what else I could say about this game, it really doesnt stick out from the vast sea of games on steam, and I dont really get why people would play this. This game is definitely not bad. But its not good either.  My final Rating for this game is 6/10, because it just doesnt stand out in any way, yes it has good graphics but that's not enough to make a nice game, the way to explain the story is original but I personally don't like it, and the customisation options of your character are EXTREMELY limited.  PS: I see people don't find this review helpful. Well I can't really change anything about that, it's just that I personally don't like the game, I wasn't gonna lie and say that I loved it now was I? However, instead of disliking my review, you might as well put in a comment to tell me why you like this game in particular.
9881	0	a	I really couldn't understand all the hype around this. Yeah, the art style and music are good but the gameplay itself is boring. I really tried but couldn't enjoy it that much. Probably good for kids under 14 I guess.
9882	0	a	Generic pretentious indie trash/10
9883	0	a	Plays like a platformer, decidedly not an RPG.  Addendum after having finally devoted some time to finishing this. The music is beautiful, the artwork exceptional. Gameplay is abysmal without a controller. I am a keyboard player and there is one particular area near the end game, where you (FINALLY) get to jump that is a huge PITA on keyboard. The story is weak in the (mostly not) telling. The crappy choose this irrelevant course over that irrelevant course ending that is becoming annoyingly cliche is even worse here in that there is no attachment developed to the world or its characters (three besides the main, none get fleshed out). So, it's a bad button masher with bad controls and virtually no story. There is, as well, essentially no real choice that matters and no essential difference in character of 'The Kid' from player to player or playthrough to playthrough. 3/10. Soundtrack is great though.
9884	0	a	Pretty, unique soundtrack, pleasant voice acting, challenging, not particularly fun or original.
9885	0	a	This music made my ears bleed and the graphics made my eyes boil out of my head. No deal
9886	0	a	I don't know I didn't like it immediately the combat was garbage it reminded me of crappy classic MMO's and things like torchlight which are pretty bad combat wise...and i'm big on combat perspective if the game has a pretty bad combat system I wont play it if something is underpowered, slow, not fun to use in general how I am supposed to enjoy the entire game playing like this. Yea no thanks might aswell play some free to play MMO.
9887	0	a	I didn't find anything special in this game. Not a must play in my opinion.
9888	0	a	so dumb. couldnt even think up an original name. just go play overwatch you scrubs. bastion main btw

9890	0	a	                                                    this game sucks its boring far too quirky and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
9891	0	a	bought this game on sale &gt; downloaded it &gt; played it &gt; amazed &gt; got repetitive &gt; BOOORRIIIINGGGGGGGGGGGG &gt; refund. ~the end~
9892	0	a	Requires xinput so this game only has controller support on Windows. Uninstalling and emailing Steam to request a refund.
9893	0	a	i tried so hard to like this game but honestly i was bored out of my mind. I hate when people try to be artsy fartsy and ruin a somewhat good idea. The whole thing is too far out there, it is simply trying too hard to be the next artsy game. They purposely went out of their way to make it weird, even though you can tell that is not who they are. If it was naturally weird that would be fine, but it is that awkward weird. Like that awkeward drunk guy who is not drunk but wants everyone to think that he or she is, and you have to play along or it gets even more awkward.   I give the game a Solid 50 out of 100. Great art, smooth controls, nice menus, music is very strange but not bad, just as a game package no no no.
9894	0	a	Think 'Braid' plus 'Diablo': Style, story, and dungeon crawling. Not a lot in terms of gameplay beyond that unless you want to try all the available challenges, so unremarkable overall.
9895	0	a	I think Its messed when you have a brand new mac 27' and this game just pops up as a blank screen everytime all i get is the music EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND FEELIN VERY RIPPED OFF!
9896	0	a	you know, im one of those people who consider video games art. people may have put bastion in some sort of museum but i consider it one of those paintings that looks like someone literally just splashed paint on the canvas directly from the can and got paid a lot of money for not much work. 2/10 would not buy on etsy
9897	0	a	Boring gameplay. Combat is clunky and all weapons feel same. Even though spirit and invoke systems provide some variety, it's not enough. Soundtracks are mediocre at best. On the other hand, art style and animations are very well done. Narrator adds some depth to the game.  For those, whose priority is 'gameplay' for 'games', I don't recommend it.
9898	0	a	Good? Yes. $15 good? No. This game is decent, but is very repetitive. If you really want it, wait for it to go on sale.
9899	0	a	This should have been right up my alley, but for some reason, I just couldnt get into it.  I think it was the weapon challenges, and trying to do them with the wonky controls. Extremely off-putting.  But I can see the potential, and maybe I will give it another go at a later date.
9900	0	a	I would like to give Bastion a good review but can't. Pretty but boring. I think it is a pacing issue. For an action game its clunky, boring, with too long of pauses between action. I've tried to play the game three times and just can't stand it.
9901	0	a	Get it on sale for a few bucks. Tight controls and easy to play. But, that narrator and repetative gameplay get old. After a few hours you've seen all it does... same enemies, tile layout etc. If there were a few more elements to it... it could have been great.
9902	0	a	Why this game is considered a good game? For the approximate combat system? For the predictable plot full of clichÃ¨? For the cast of boring characters? For the only 9 types of enemy? (boss including) Or maybe for the fact that all the missions you'll face will be the same? The soundtrack is the only thing awesome in this game
9903	0	a	Bastion was probably one of the first indie games which I wanted to play. When I finally got myself it on Steam I was happy. This game is so beatiful, have a great music and most amazing thing - narration, one kind of voice that you will never forget. Yet, Bastion is a one big disappointment. There is one reason for that and it's that game is getting boring quite fast. The story also is not bad but somehow, even with all these things combined together, I just couldn't spent in Bastion more than 30min-1hour per sitting. And so after many months I did it. I beat the game. To be honest, it was a hell ride for me. Was it gameplay? Dunno. I understand this many positive reviews and I really would want to give Bastion one myself but I can't. Even with this many great elements Bastion wasn't a fun game to play for me.
9904	0	a	The game is good and fun but the game is short. Not worth the price.
9905	0	a	Meh.. too repeating hack and slash
9906	0	a	Took a break from this game a loooong time ago because it just wasn't my cup of tea, something felt off about it. So here I am three years later, picking it up again... and something still feels off about it.  First, if it wasn't obvious from the bajillion reviews already, this is a sort of action-RPG without much of the RPG part - so basically a top down hack-n-slash. It's 2D in presentation, but everything is very obviously a 3D model.   The environmental art is pretty great, and the music really complements the feel of the world. The main character guy's model looks way beefier than he looks in the promotional artwork for this game, which is a little off putting but completely a matter of opinion.   The thing most people know about this game is the Narrator guy, who both looks and sounds like he should be narrating the adventures of Clint Eastwood in the grittiest cowboy movie ever filmed, but instead somehow found a job narrating the adventures of oddly beefy protag in crumbling world land. I'll give the game credit where it's due here - this isn't something you see almost ever, and it's kind of interesting. You can imagine this story being told around a campfire and sort of have that feeling of visualizing it in your head were you being told it in person, but it has a few hiccups in pretty specific areas where it's just silence for a while until you manage the next thing that triggers the narration. It would be weird if the narrator just never shut up or rambled on, though, so I don't expect him to talk constantly, just... finish the thought in one go. Paying that dude to narrate as much as he did though must have been half the game's budget.  So, gameplay, which is naturally my biggest problem with the game. Your character's kind of slow, and suffers from the same thing Link suffers from - rolling becomes the best option to get anywhere or get anything done. The game would benefit so much from the ability to run and the ability to perform a dash attack, but whatever. Maybe there's a dash attack and I haven't played far enough in to get it, but mechanics that add to the general enjoyment of the game shouldn't be locked behind hours of gameplay. Also I get that there's tons of ranged options, but I just can't abide the enemies floating off the stage somewhere, this is really painful in the timed stages.  Overall I don't think it's the pinnacle of action RPGs, or hack-n-slashes, or really the pinnacle of any game type, unless 'campfire story' is a genre, in which case it is a pioneer. It came out of the blue from a development studio that came out of the blue, and when you look at it from that perspective, it's pretty good for that, but that narration budget could have gone a lot farther had it been used in the gameplay department.   Anyway, because 'indifference' still isn't an option, I'm going to say no, I don't recommend it. If you want to play a game just to look at pretty scenery, there's better options out there, and the same goes for listening to a good soundtrack or an audiobook - youtube's free. The gameplay has the groundwork of being solid, and isn't buggy nor does it feel rushed, but it desperately needed to be expanded upon.
9907	0	a	You cannot use a controller with this game on the Mac. It should not have been shipped as ready for the platform, and years on they still have not fixed it. Black spot on a great game, sure, but not supporting the best kind of input device for the game is a dealbreaker.
9908	0	a	Only if you want to lose your money and time.
9909	0	a	Art direction? Gorgeous. Soundtrack? Haunting. Narrator? Fascinating. Gameplay? Repetitive and boring.  All the pieces are there for a great game, except the mind-numbingly repetitive and unrewarding gameplay. I don't mind repetitive gameplay if I feel like I'm being properly rewarded for it, but that's not the case for this one.
9910	0	a	Really wanted to love this game, but it just didn't keep my attention enough for me to finish it. The art design is good but nothing mindblowing or original; kind of a weird vaguely steampunk/fantasy mish-mash that didn't really work for me.   The biggest problems are the repetitive gameplay and the narrator gimmick that gets old almost immediately. I admire that something different was attempted, but it simply wasn't a replacement for storytelling and dialogue. I often found myself confused about what was happening due to being distracted by trying to fight enemies and simply play the game while the angsty narrator grumbled story details.  The mechanics are faily poor as well. The normal movement of the Kid is painfully slow, and I found myself constantly tapping roll just to get around at a normal pace, which was really tiresome. This on top of the odd feel to the combat was just too problematic.   Overall, not a terrible game, but the praise is highly disproportionate to the actual quality. I've heard good things about Transistor though, so will definitely give that a chance because I like what this company os going for, Bastion just didn't hold up enough for me to finish it, so I can't strongly suggest it, though ot would strongly discourage one from playing it either.
9911	0	a	Overrated game. It is ok for its price on discount, but otherwise it is a subpar ARPG. The narration is good, the story is short, and poor. Fights are okish, but unless shrines are activated it is extremely easy. I finished the game in less than half a day. Sound and music are decent.  In my opinion there are better ARPGs out there at the price point this game is marketed at and this game does not deserve its overwhelmingly positive review status.
9912	0	a	Game has no story and honestly is only worth buying on sale to waste time. The preview is pretty much what the game is like. The guy is talking throughout the game, and that's your story.
9913	0	a	After a while it gets enormously boring. This game is only a repetition of basic game mechanics.
9914	0	a	Bastion is a fun casual hack and slash, but I found it to be rather forgettable overall. I don't understand the hype behind it. Not much happens in the story for ~10 hours of gameplay. The story is very slow, which I think is what killed it for me.  Still not a bad game. But I would not recommend.
9915	0	a	Great art style. Then you have clunky controls, useless powers and an annoying narrator.
9916	0	a	No matter how good the presentation of this game is the gameplay don't match it. It is just plain boring to wander around in the world of Bastion since the fighting only feels tedious, mostly because the rewards you get doesn't add anything interesting to the mix. New weapons are introduced at a good pace but doesn't do enough to make the fighting interesting enough. The whole part with your home base (a.k.a. The Bastion) is a missed opportunity, everything you can do there is just boring instead of an exciting part of the game. The upgrades to both weapons and your character are barely noticable which probably is my biggest complaint about the game.  Again, the graphics and music deliver, but the rest doesn't. If you want something with way better combat I recommend the Ys-games instead (don't play them for the story though). Story wise I would say Bastion stays at the 'meh'-level. It isn't bad, but it isn't interesting either. Thumbs up for the narrator though.
9917	0	a	As much as I want to love Bastion - beautiful, atmospheric music and environment, strong character and story design - I just can't bring myself to finish the game. Bastion solely uses an auto-save feature, which is a deal-breaker for me. I hate re-doing content just because I had my gameplay interrupted for whatever reason. That doesn't feel fun, it feels punitive. I much prefer to replay content because I want to!
9918	0	a	I do not recommend Bastion, if you want to experience a worthful story. Basically you have to find Cores and (after that) Fragments to build the Bastion up, for that, the game throws you into different independend (by times short, but beautiful designed) locations where you have to fight through enemies, grab the main item and leave again.  This kind of presentation gets repetetive quickly.  Bastion has its strength in its fightning System, which is really extensive but suffers from the problem that the player can easily skip the combat just by rolling through the levels. Its far quicker and more valuable for the player in most cases. Yeah you don't have to do this, but this option alone makes it to a problem of the game design.
9919	0	a	Great soundtrack! Nothing special in gameplay.  Just a funny time killer which you can play on a laptop when your primary gaming PC is occupied by your girlfriend. Otherwise it's too booooring.
9920	0	a	I bought this game two years ago because it was on sale and I played it for a very short time due to the fact that it was repetitive. Wanting to give it a second change, I installed it just recently but I couldn't go on with the gameplay for the same reason as last time. The soundtrack and the narration are superb, but these aren't enough to keep me entertained. I can see the fact that this game isn't about the gameplay and it's more about the feeling it gives you while playing it. If you want an incredible experience in terms of soundtrack and story (the narration goes a long way in making the story good) go buy this game and I think you'll fing it enjoyable. But if you consider that gameplay is more important and there is absolutely no way you can enjoy a game that's repetitive, I don't think this is the game for you because ultimately you'll find it, simply put, boring.
9921	0	a	This game was so highly recommended and when I bought it I wasn't impressed at all. It may have also been beacause of the old, quite slow laptop I had at the time. Now, with a new laptop and a better graphics card I gave Bastion another chance and although it grew on me at first, I still must conclude that this game is heavily overrated...
9922	0	a	it's a beautiful game, visually and musically. it is an uncommon position i hold in finding the narrator to be pretentious and incredibly annoying. the actual gameplay, though, was just mindnumbing repetition of a combat style which i didn't find to be all that fun or engaging to begin with.  i have tried (hard) to like this game, and failed. it's not a bad game, by any means, and LOADS of people like it. the odds are TREMENDOUSLY in favor of you liking it based upon the reviews here. there is a FREE DEMO that you can check out to find out for yourself! just i, personally, can always find a game that i would have (more?) fun playing instead,
9923	0	a	I really want to like this game.  The world in Bastion is very well fleshed out. The graphics and characters are also quite charming.  But getting all these different weapons and stuff is giving me a headache. Especailly since in feels like I need to go and upgrade them by either findng the necessary item or completeing skill challeneges.  A lot of the weapons also feel redundant, so that doesn't help either.
9924	0	a	I'm not entirely convinced by this game. There seems to be a certain amount of dissonance between the storytelling ideas and the actual gameplay leaving me with the feeling that the story is suggests something far grander than is actually happening in the gameplay.
9925	0	a	i can appreciate the artwork, the soundtrack, and the idea, but i'd rather shove needles through the tip of my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ than play any more of this game. maybe i'll pick it back up when im REALLLLY bored, but for now im gonna avoid it... cuz its boring.
9926	0	a	Button masher; take it or leave it. Great vocals in both the music and narrated story. Doesn't offer much after you beat it the first time.
9927	0	a	3/10, and that's being generous. This review will sound harsh, but that's because getting the controls down was the sole hurdle to be overcome when porting this mobile game to PC/MAc. Simply put, the terrible controls ruin the game.  This game is a sloppy port of an IPAD/IPHONE game, and isn't even worth the sale price of $2.00 as it stands 5/28/14, let alone the $15 price tag when not on sale!!! SHEESH!!! The fact that the people who released this MOBILE game on Mac/PC changed nothing in the game mechanics is bad enough, but the clunky directional controls destroy any chance of this game being playable. It is blatantly obvious the game mechanics are still optomized for touchscreens. Meaning aiming/shooting/dodging is next to impossible. Atleast doing any 2 of those at 1 time is. Particularly moving while aiming/shooting. Not to mention there are so many buttons required, which are all so far from where your hands need to be. Even spending 20 minutes trying to remap/customize the controls did nothing to help, because deep down, the movement is riddled with problems.  On a rosier note, I will be attempting to use my PS3 controller as a gamepad, and see if maybe the game is playable using that. I own Bastion on my ipad, and it's a decent game....when it works.   Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cluster- â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I am hoping this is fixed, but seeing as I just purchased the game for ~90% off, at $2.00; I'm guessing this is going to be a permanent, and dealbreaking, problem with the game. Shameful, I will be requesting a refund of my $2.00!!!
9928	0	a	Nice graphics, stiff animations, boring gameplay.
9929	0	a	Artistically masterful, but I just don't find it very enjoyable to play.
9930	0	a	I've heard a lot about this game. I tried really hard to like it. The combat seems wonky and the pacing seems slow.
9931	0	a	Beautiful graphic, nice music, nice narration, but terrible control... I tried with keyboard and mouse, but it's just meh. There is a demo of it, try it before you buy.
9932	0	a	This game is so bad. Can't believe I paid for it. Perspective is garbage, can't aim, can't move without pressing 2 buttons at once. Just terrible. Someone said it's their favorite game? You need to play more games.
9933	0	a	I started playing this game expecting more from both the graphics and the soundtrack everybody is talking about. I was not pleased. Quite soon I found the gameplay boring and the narrator very annoying, and the music was not really anything worth listening to.  The game itself can be confusing, you never really know what it is about, and after an hour or so you just don't care; which is why I cannot recommend it.  + Very low price.  - The gameplay. - The soundtrack. - The narrator.
9934	0	a	I tried to like it. It felt like a Gaunlet-style RPG, but felt even more cliche. The visuals are nice, the gameplay is boring. Bring on the downvotes.
9935	0	a	Although this game looks and sounds nice, my complaint is it get pretty repetitive after the first couple levels. The story is okay but the narration for that story is usually more of an annoyance than anything else.  Thankfully, the game wasn't all that long and I am glad to have completed it but it isn't something I can recommend others to play. I think I'd only change my tune if there was online co-op which I think would suit this game quite well...but that'll never happen so this review won't change!
9936	0	a	The gameplay quickly becomes tedious and the plot holes are obvious.
9937	0	a	Bastion is a very pretty game with decent story and gameplay. I liked the game at first, but the combat gets repetitive, and I just stopped playing this becuase there are better RPG games out there.
9938	0	a	The awkwardness of controls kills this game for me, on PC with mouse/keyboard that is.   Isometric + WASD == Nope.
9939	0	a	Easily one of the most boring games i have ever played.
9940	0	a	Its a pretty standard fare adventure game in the 3/4ths dimension and the classic 'throw you into the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥torm and the blanks get filled in later' story. My biggest complaint with the game sadly ends up being one of its features. I couldn't relax and enjoy the game because the narrorator never shut the hell up.
9941	0	a	First I will say that I really love this game. Second I will say I really hate this game. Great graphics, great narration. I enjoyed playing it very much. However I don't enjoy replaying the same section over and over because the game doesn't save my progress... Over 4 years they still haven't solved this problem??? That's ridiculous if you ask me. I was googling and this problem dates back to 2010-2011 with no solution that I have found. I would only recommend this game right now if you like being extremely frustrated and or you like redoing things over and over again. All in all probably 80% of my time spent on this game has been redoing what I had already done. Very depressing as I really like this game...
9942	0	a	Bastion is about a boy in a fairy world affected by a cataclysm. Bastion is a linear story driven rpg. There are upgraders, levels and xp. But it is not a hack n slash rpg. Bastion has a great narrator and excellent music in common with Transistor, also made by Supergiant Games. I like this and I will probably also finish it in New Game Plus mode.  Update: I did not palay it through in New Game Plus mode...
9943	0	a	Its cool and all but somehow I tend to lose interest about halfway through the game. You may want to pick this up during a sale though
9944	0	a	Haiku Review:  Such lovely story and art But such boring gameplay Cannot help feel dissapoint
9945	0	a	gameplay is boring the art is unappealing and the narration is annoying from what i hear the story is supposedly good but if i wanted a good story i would have just read a book
9946	0	a	cheesy for little diapers babies
9947	0	a	5.5 / 10 Left Zulf to die like the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ he was
9948	0	a	I don't understand the positive reviews for this game. The combat, the narration, and the music have been praised, but I thought they became repetitive and stale very quickly.
9949	0	a	Great soundtrack and visual art, but the rest is an exercise in mediocrity. Very overrated.
9950	0	a	Nice art-style  Nice narration  Bland gameplay &amp; combat   Notmycupoftea/10 
9951	0	a	The game is an absolute masterpiece, but it has one dealbreaking flaw that is utterly illogical and unnacceptable at this point: it basically tells left-handed people to go f*** themselves.... terrible design, in my opinion. I know the game was made in 2011, but at that particular point in history it was a well-known fact, like, for about a couple of millenia, that left-handed people exist, that they comprise a rather large chunk of the over all population, and they like to play video games... but hey, in Bastion's dev's minds, if you're a lefty, you can go suck it, right?
9952	0	a	GREAT GAME BUT...  Great story telling and awesome soundtrack coupled with artistic design. The premise of the game is simple enough to enjoy really at any age but the game play is a bit infuriating not to mention .05% buggy. While playing I felt almost claustrophobic where I was in the game which, I get is part of the game design but when you're running in the 8 main directions and none of which is straight, it gets old after a while. There are instances the character turns around with question positioning you with your back to enemies, which sounds like an easy fix but when you have no where to step and cannot spin in one spot it again, gets old. Weapons are fun to play with and there are plenty to choose from but I really could not get an effective amount of time to enjoy them because almost every new level would introduce a new weapon on a level pretty much meant for it and would ruin the set up I had set out with and getting rid of my secret skill. The only places to enjoy the set ups were in the same old fighting pits in who knows where. The mementos were good but could add more to the story. Love the pets. Might think about adding them to a journey out in the wild would be nice enhancement. Finally after a while the vigils started giving out some good coin, but when you have some of those weapon specific missions that can be achieved in the proving grounds shooting 'foes' a.k.a. tumbleweeds, it seems like the game design was slightly underdeveloped. TO SUM UP. I rarely write reviews, usually glistening ones or scathing ones, this one I feel is right in the middle because it's fun enough to play through but there were plenty that bothered me about it. Maybe that was the point?
9953	0	a	This is hard to write but it's my personal opinion, so take it as is.  Simply put, you'll either love this game to bits or you'll finish it and feel 'meh'...that's what happened to me. Don't get me wrong, the game has something really good to it: the visuals are stunning, there's plenty of weapons to choose from and the soundtrack and narrator are outstanding(even got the Announcer Pack in Dota 2)...but what's left if you take that away?  A boring, repetitive and not so deep action rpg where you do the same stuff for about 6 hours and spam buttons.  I had this game for a while and REALLY tried to like it, trust me, but I just couldn't. Being a gamer for quite a while now(way too many years to be honest) I don't see some fancy visuals and feel sold on the whole experience...I want more, and in that sense Bastion could not deliver.  Again, I loved WATCHING the game but not playing it...it was just too simple, plain and didn't leave me a lot.  P.s. keep in mind I'm not reccomending the game to people like me, to all the rest just grab it when it's on sale and you probably won't be disappointed!
9954	0	a	So so. Nothing special about this one. It got boring at some part.
9955	0	a	Beautiful art, scenery, music and narration. Eventhough I use to love those things and usually its enough to pull me in to the game, in the case however, almost every bit of gameplay turns me off as the more you play the more you realize that the gameplay itself is not what sells this game. I've seen several games which met art. Bastion is a great piece of art yet just an ordinary piece of an average game.
9956	0	a	I can see why some people like this game, and I know exactly who they are. I'm tempted to buy them all a copy so they'll stay home playing it and  keep off of my lawn!   More gravitas and less gravol for me.   3 of 5 stars. Maybe 4. But then I'd have to recommend it. Just leave me alone and  keep off of my lawn! 
9957	0	a	The gameplay in bastion consists of a beautiful atmosphere and some excellent narration where your actions are beautifully narrated.I play games for the gameplay and this was the most boring and bland gameplay I have ever seen. It got so repetitive so fast.Just basically killing the same enemies over and over again with little variance.Not recommended.
9958	0	a	The game looks good, sounds good, has a nice atmosphere... and it's cheap.  But I found the gameplay too be too simplistic and boring. Not my cup of tea.
9959	0	a	Bastion is a nice game when playing the first time, however, when you pass the game, you cannot find a reason to play it anymore, even though the game will allow you to elevate the creep's difficulty, i have to say, it's really don't work.  The weapon in the game is just too munch, but not all the weapon is well designed, when you pick a weapon gained in the late game, you will never use the early ones. As a result, the diverse weapon gameplay, which is the designer's original purpose i guess, is lose to the abosulute weapon damage.   There are also weapon upgrade missions for each weapon, some are good, but some are just really torture to a normal human.   The level is elevated very low, and when I passed the game, i was only level 5. I can find many many stuffs used in a high level, but let's go back to the point, i really cannot find myself a cause to play a higher level. Really boring! A bad design, I am afraid.
9960	0	a	I don't understand how this simple as hell, shallow and boring game, is as popular as it is.  I guess if you are about 8 years old, it is a good game to get.
9961	0	a	I realize I'm part of the minority here. I just didn't get what everyone else seemed to out of this game. Gameplay wasn't fun for me. The narrator wasn't great. Story wasn't there for me either.
9962	0	a	I feel bad leaving a negative review especially since the game is so beautiful (and the whole world wants me to love it). But the reason I am doing so is because the story is so vague - It doesn't make sense. The narrator has a great voice but thats all you can hear and after a point it gets annoying (I hate him calling the player kid all the time)  FInally, the most important thing in a hack and slash is the combat, and the combat was dull, it was just button mashing for me.  
9963	0	a	Might be alright if you have a controller, but otherwise it is too much like hard work for me to enjoy!
9964	0	a	Just finished playing through it for the first time and for me this game wasn't something I would recommend. Only thing I liked about it was the music and some of the combat. Story wasn't something that interested me or got a grip of me. Combat was so and so. Didn't feel difficult except a very few moments it was a bit hectic. Even if you used idols it didn't get to bad. The proving grounds were either way easy or some a pain until weapon upgraded. Graphically it was ok. It was just a game that I played through but didn't have any feelings afterwards like, 'that was a great game!' or the like.  I do not recommend this game as I didn't enjoy it.
9965	0	a	Very Beautiful. Nice little story. But the narator annoyed afer a while me. Also the gameplay is not that great. Kinda boring. The games delivers a great experience but fails to motivate me for the long term. What do to? Recommend or not? It is a great piece of art but I bought it to play and not a poster for my wall. I am sorry to not recommend this game :(
9966	0	a	I tried to get into this game twice now, but I can never stick with it. The game never really grabs me at the beginning. Im not sure if it is the isometric camera view or the on-rails 'adventuring' experience. On the other hand, the narrator is pretty awesome though.
9967	0	a	Its alright for a bit but then it just gets boring and glitches in the game are annoying like when you do the weapon challenges and you get stuck on a platform so you have to die over and over again just to restart. Not fun
9968	0	a	Steam Overlay doesn't work with Bastion on OSX, so the Steam controller is not working as well.
9969	0	a	Bastion is a good game: it's polished, has an original setting, atmosphere, and even original perspective from a third person narrator whom is in the game, but... It's just too repetitive for me. Yes, there's challenges for each weapon, optional trophies to make it more difficult (kind of like Halo 3 skulls), but the gameplay is too mediocre: it didn't really grasp my attention, it was just there. The story is also alright, the lore is semi-interesting, and some characters are cool but the way the story progresses feels too much of, 'Go here, beat the monsters, finish the level, go back to town, repeat.' I mean, most RPG games have that scheme but to me good games don't make you realize it. I feel bad not recommending it but I don't think it was worth the $15 I paid for.  7.0/10. I acknowledge it is a polished game with an original setting but the combat and story progression is too repetitive and boring to want to continue playing.
9970	0	a	I actually did enjoy this game for the most part, but I had to downvote it for the ridiculous calamity cannon challenge. It simply does not match the difficulty of the rest of the game and it really ruined the latter part of the game for me. In fact, I didn't really care for any of the challenges.
9971	0	a	This game doesn't work. I'm running it on Mac. I've done everything and then some. All kinds of suggestions the forms said. When I launch the game, no icon shows up, and the game hangs. When i try to quit steam, it tells me to quite Bastion (which steam says is running but isn't (I checked the system processes)). When the developer fixes this issue so that I can play their game one a 2015 retina macbook pro operated by a computer scientist, I'll consider changing my review.
9972	0	a	Itâ€™s always hard for me to give thumbs down to a game I had so much expectations for and really wanted to like, I think reviews should be honest, open and must examine most of the aspects, quality and details of a game, it is normal to see funny and one liner reviews on steam that do not even bother to analyze a game in depth, which is downright sad.  But again, I had such expectations for this titleâ€¦ it happened it is just really not my cup of tea.   Story
9973	0	a	0/10 crashes after new windows 10 updates
9974	0	a	Was alright at first, but got really repetitive later on and I lost interest. Didn't finish.
9975	0	a	Okay. This is a fun game, but I was able to complete it in 4 hours. And that wasnt me just hammering through the story mode, I did majority of the mini-games. So for that reason I cannot recommend at full price. But if it is on sale. Get it. Because it is a fun game, but not worth Â£10.99
9976	0	a	Warner Bors PLEASE READ/NOT REALLY FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT. Ok this is not so much a review as it is a â€œNOTE/WARNINGâ€ to any one looking to pick up this game who uses a Playstation 4 controller (fairly native hardware to Steam on Mac) and a PLEA FOR HELP to the developers who are awesome so I hope you read this guys. So love this game first off and Steam is the 3rd platform Iâ€™ve purchased this game on, love it, with that said it maybe the only platform other people buy this game on and for a lot of Mac users we use the PS4 controller because of its native syncing to Mac and Steam, so could you guys PLEASE UPDATE THE GAME TO BE PS4 CONTROLLER COMPATIBLE! Not meaning to yell that, just want you guys to see it load and clear, because THE GAME IS AWESOME but completely broken when using another controller other than a Xbox controller, PS4 controller only has â€˜up, down, triangle and squareâ€™ that works and no was to map the controller in game! please help guys, again love the game its a gem but could you map the PS4 controller like you did with Transistor (another truely amazing game) PLEASE! looking forward to your next project.

9978	0	a	This game became really repetitive very very quickly.
9979	0	a	Really great game - unfortunately some updates broke the game on Linux, and other updates fixed it.  This resulted in me losing all my save data.  Great game, bad QA department. Ruined the experience for me.
9980	0	a	i really enjoy this game. I really had a lot of fun and look forward to spaz2.  the world is fun to be in, the unlocking and economy really works in the setting.  the reason i can't recommend this is because the grind is so harsh in the beggining and just gets worse and worse from there. just got to the final chapter and that's it, i'm done. if you're a completionist this game will frustrate you.  There is about 15-20 hours of content that has taken me almost 50. That's how bad the grind is.
9981	0	a	The game started out sounding very nice. It sounded, and looked, from the trailers, to be very enjoyable. Then I bought it and played for a little while. The concepts are all there, they're all done as well as can be expected, and, if it were paced a little better, the game would be pretty good. The problem is right there, though - pacing. Half of the time I was playing, I was just mining rocks to try and get more money to upgrade my ships. When I finally managed to get into combat, my enemies would take a small amount of damage and just run from me. Over half of my combat time was chasing down enemies in the vast nothingness that exists everywhere in search of that one last â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ needed to complete the mission.
9982	0	a	Though initially i was drawn into SPAZ, after a few hours i realized that the bulk of the game boils down to grinding the handful of recycled randomly generated missions you will come across in every sector. Its not really avoidable, to avoid being steamrolled by each group of enemy ships you will have to grind data to ensure your tech level is consistently 5+ levels higher than them not to mention you'll need to grind for blackbox data to build better ships. Assuming youve stuck it out that long you'll find yourself with extremely limited hangar space, which means that in the vast majority of battles you are greatly outnumbered by superior ships.   I tried addressing the game's shortcoming with mods but the modding component of the game appears to be broken as none of them function and i cant be arsed to fix something that should be working when the game is just not compelling enough to warrant it.
9983	0	a	As a game inspired by Star Control, it desperately, desperately needs controller support. Instead it uses awkward mouse-aim + WASD in a top-down game, and ten hours in I haven't seen any ship or weapon that really takes advantage of that.   Speaking of ships and weapons, there isn't a wild diversity in either - you pick a size of ship, decide whether you want the slightly faster one or the one with slightly more weapons, and kit it out with variations on lasers, projectiles, and homing projectiles. Bombs are basically big missiles with long cooldowns, and fighters are just missiles that fire more often. Combine this with a tech system that results in weapons/systems you don't use much being typically weaker, and the game at hour ten feels very much like the game at hour one. Point your ship at the other ship and hold down both mouse buttons.  The great big open starmap looks good until you realize the only real variant from system to system is the level of enemy ships and the presence or absence of bounty hunters, which seem to exist primarily as arena locations and also as another way to slow down the player by putting bounties on their heads. The missions in a level 1 sector are the same as the ones in a level 35 sector.  The in-game chatter is terribly repetitive after only a few hours, though it can be turned off.  So yeah, kind of a dull game.
9984	0	a	The style and idea behind this game are appealing, but the game is made unpleasant by several glaring design flaws.  You only ever seem to have around 3 ships to control at once. That doesn't really give you much in the way of tactical options. You're frequently put into situations where you go up against way more ships than that, so it feels strange to have only one large ship and two small ships and be expected to feel like you're being strategic/tactical.  The issue with the tactical options is compounded by the need to grind a lot to have weapons strong enough to take on foes of a given tech level. The damage system is interesting, you have shields, then armor, then hull. Beams are strong against shields, cannons are strong against armor, and launchers are strong against hull. However, according to the DEVS THEMSELVES, a good strategy is to only focus on upgrading one of beams/cannons. What was the point of the damage model if you're just going to suggest people not worry about trying to match up the correct weapon based on the situation of the enemy ships? Because I didn't know about this, I was getting to the point where most of my time was spent grinding to at least 1.5x the tech level of the enemies I would go against. It seems like the designer didn't really think about how the damage and tech level system really affected the fun of the gameplay.  There's a lot of time spent just doing repetitive mission types over and over again to get data so you can level up your tech. It gets old after awhile, even though there's a decent variety of mission types, once you play a certain type once, it isn't really fun to play it again. The only thing to keep you going is a desire to progress through the story or feel like you're 'being productive', but really you're just doing the same stuff over and over again. It doesn't make for very fun gameplay.  The whole idea of the Bounty Hunters is also an issue. Bounty Hunters in space is really thematically appropriate, but the way it's implemented in this world just adds unpleasant busy work. Every time you do missions you accrue 'bounty'. Whenever you jump, if your bounty is high enough and your near a bounty hunter lair, you'll be attacked by powerful ships and probably will have to reload a save. The only way to get rid of bounty is to go to a lair and pay them, or complete 'arena challenges' which net you some Rez and relieve some bounty. The arena challenges are very fun, but I frequently found myself in a situation where I had maxed out my Rez so I just had to pay a bunch of money and never really felt a reason to play the challenges. It's just a resource sink without much fun behind. If it was possible to beat bounty hunters when they attacked you I would consider this fixed. There's plenty of other ways it could be improved, of course.  Other than that, there's just lots of little annoyances throughout the game that indicate a lack of polish. One petty example is that, on escort missions, the ship you are escorting might have cloaking, but will be invisible to you, which makes it difficult to tell where you need to be. Escort missions have other problems, like the behavior of the escorted ship (it will sometimes go in the opposite direction, won't follow you, etc...). This is just one example of a minor design issue. There's others; like the heavy reliance on saving and loading (breaking immersion and breaking up the flow of the gameplay).  Overall, it's insulting to Mound and Blade to call this game 'Mount and Blade in Space'. Mount and Blade lacks a lot of the issues that make SPAZ unpleasant (after a few hours of playing). Unlike games like Mount and Blade, I just never feel like I'm becoming more powerful. I don't feel like I'm interacting with the galaxy because all the solar systems are very closed off from each other.   If you're looking for a game that actually gives you a sense of strategy, tactics, and power, you should look into Starsector (formerly Starfarer), which is currently playable though in-development. I think it does a better job of providing the sort of experience this game was trying to provide.
9985	0	a	This game could have been good.The premise was excellent, but the execution was lacking. A procedurally generated galaxy which you explore with your fully customizable pirate fleet? Sign me up! Unfortunately, the game had some fundamental problems. The basic gameplay grew dull and repetitive far too quickly. More advanced mechanics were too slow in unlocking. The storyline had no meat and no hook.  However, if this type of game is your bag, this game is totally worth $2 on steam sale to see whether or not you like it.
9986	0	a	An obvious labor of love, and a love letter to Star Control 2... and a leading candidate for exemplifying the necessity of polish in games. It is so mind-bogglingly dull thanks to really poor pacing and a nasty set of balance issues that I really can't recommend it at all. Supposedly it's still being worked on, and I can see modders fixing almost all the problems with the game, but right now it's just garbage. There are ideas and systems in place that could almost certainly be fun, and they simply aren't, thanks to some bad math, for the most part.  As an addendum, I feel the need to point out that combat is mindless and broken. Examples: AI is brainless and employs its weapons for minimal effect, often failing to use their full complement of weaponry. Enemy AI uses a simple tactic of running away when their health is low, which can lead to endless chases if you happen to pick a slow set of ships. Your own AI is almost impossible to control precisely and loves to wander into range of enemy weapons, and shoot your allies. In a late-game mission, you are tasked with defending four generators simultaneously: attempting to do so will get them all blown up. But, if you concentrate all your ships at one generator, the enemy completely ignores the other three. The list goes on. DON'T BUY THIS GAME IN THIS STATE.

Many of the tasks actaull got kind of repeitive in m opinion and it was somewhat confusing to start. However, I may just be overpicky since I am comparing it to the great Flash Trek Broken Mirror.  Rating: 5.1/10

'Hunting' down the infected aliens is less of a hunt, and more of a mindless chase. They run the opposite direction at speeds near yours, only they'll be at distances like 30,000+ . . .   The goal is to 'clean up' a system, or you're labeled as a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for not completing the mission. The problem is the real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is the coders that can't think of a decent combat. The combat will be over, long over, like ages . . . and ages . . . and ages over, yet another stupid tiny infected alien will spawn on the other side of the system. At this point, the only thing you can do is turn around, and have a mindless wait as you drag your ship slowly across the 'system' (a needlessly large grid) to get to the point where you easily pop the tiny ship.  There are great battles, don't get me wrong, it's the hell that is mis-labled at the game that gets my 'No' for recommend.  On top of the lame 'zit popping' adventure, there is a new element added to the targeting system, where the turrets refuse to aim toward anything you are choosing to shoot at. Something went horribly wrong with an update, and I seriously doubt it will ever be fixed.

Blast through endless (literally, infinitely spawning missions) of dull ships by shooting at them with your [weapon choice], fly through the debris and hoover up exp and money and crew members.  I honestly don't see why I even have to be at the computer. The AI could be taking care of this with a 'go to enemy and fire fire fire' routine... and in fact that's exactly what my AI teammates do.  That I would rather have this game running without playing it shows that it's not enjoyable to play, just to level up and find out the next % increase on my laser beam length.
9990	0	a	Would love to love it, but the game doesn't love me back.  It's fun and easy until you reach act 3. Then it is just punishing and takes all fun away. Cannons maxed, shields maxed, lots of point im secondary system, almost no points in unused systems... get wrecked by AI ships. Well, sometimes it's still pretty ok, but then you have two enemy ships with equal tech as yourself, but you don't need to know a lot about the game that this won't work. Searching for answers about how to deal with this brings up countless players having the same issue. Trying other stragtegies is no fun because of the random nature of the game and the fact that losses will end up in grinding money to get on track again. Add to this that every respec costs tons of data/XP and stops your progress for hours.  Very disappointed.
9991	0	a	Thought this was great!....then tedium set in...
9992	0	a	It's good at first, then you hit a wall and have to spend two hours to either grind the same event over and over, or restart and make a new world to buy a randomly generated upgrade that may or may nor be better.
9993	0	a	Fun to start with, then you realize this game is all about the grind. Horrible, boring, dull, mindless grind.  Oh yeah, and AI's favourite tactic is retreating, all the time. AI ship faster than yours? Combat never ends. What fun.
9994	0	a	I did not find the combat enjoyable one tiny bit. The ship handling is sloppy. The ships have tons of momentum and terrible acceleration so changing directions is a pain and takes way too long. You spend most of your time flying past your enemies and missing your shots, then trying to turn around for another pass, only to miss again, and then turn around again, and so on and so forth. Actually killing anything took way too long and was simply more trouble and aggravation than it was worth. I was mislead by an idiotic comment by a curator, describing the game as 'arcadey', it's anything but. Do not expect to get your space combat thrills here.
9995	0	a	I normally never both to review games on Steam, but in this case I'll make an exception. Maybe this game is a type of genre people enjoy that just isn't for me and that's fine, but the reason I can't recommend it is about 50% of the game could be flat out cut.   I've had this game in my Library for a long time and wanted to finish it as I'm a bit of a completionist. However, upon returning to it recently I cannot bring myself to play it anymore.   There seems so much to this game and based on what I saw before buying it I was excited to customize my ships and all that jazz but 6.8 hours into the game what have I actually accomplished? Very little.   Sure, I could be accused of not being patient or wanting maximum rewards for minimum effort, but in most other games during that time I'd have done more than float about a few quadrents listening to the same dam messages repeat over and over and over. Warp to a place, kill some guys, rinse and repeat.   There might be more to this game later but so far I've had so little fun I can't bare to get further. I guess if you really want to find a way to sink hundereds of hours into floating about doing repetitive tasks in the most unfun way possible this is the game for you.
9996	0	a	Unless you really, and I mean REALLY love arcade shooty games: Don't buy it.  There is no tactics, just firing random â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t at the AI.  Upgrades are Ok, but after 'Random â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t Topedonukerocket number 5' killed me over and over again I was just tired of grinding.  I'm six hours in and I'm not gonna touch that game again.
9997	0	a	Do you like spending a looooong time fighting your way through 999999 systems that all feel pretty much the same?  Do you enjoy mindless circle strafing and trivial aiming?  Do you like a ship customization system that basically amounts to little more than 'give your ship the overpowered machine gun laser'?  If so, you'll like this game. Otherwise, not so much. Say NO to strafing in physics-based space shooters!
9998	0	a	If you want to grind rice to make porridge, this game has enough grinding to do just that
9999	0	a	I do not recommend this game because it is so much work and so little fun. Grindy and unrewarding. Invest the hours in something more fun. Sheesh I though it would never end, really really had to force myself through it.
