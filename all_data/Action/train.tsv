1684	1	a	 Counter-Strike, in all of its versions, is just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy. It's a great game and all, you just can't stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days without stopping from doing it. The huge weaponry options, which you can choose, the smoothness of the gameplay and sound of the game, it's just really addicting. With this game, I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). I recommend this masterpiece to all the passionate Action &amp; F.P.S. players who are looking for a good, cheap and fun game to play with their friends. All I can say, as always: Good Luck &amp; Have Fun! &lt;3  10/10

482	1	a	An old game but it keeps you in it :D
1560	1	a	Am I really writing a recommendation for this game?  Counter-Strike  or CS 1.6  is a classic game which started off as a Half-Life 1 mod way back in late 1999, and was later sold in 2000 which required both Half-Life 1 and the game itself. Where as now, you only need the game itself on Steam.   Counter-Strike was one of the biggest multiplayer FPS games ever made, due to it being playable on many computers, and just an overall really fun game. It has no doubt made a huge impact on the world of FPS. Especially in the competitive scene such as e-sports where 1.6 is still being played today.  However, it has aged. A lot. Especially in comparison to Counter-Strike: Source. So a lot of maps are quite spacious and don't look as realistic as many would expect to todays standards.   I actually prefer CS:S over this game as I just like the feel of it more.  I honestly don't know why I'm reviewing this game, as I'm sure everyone on my friends list here has played it. But just incase you're that one odd person out that for osme reason hasn't played it - try it out, and see whether you like it or not.

1562	1	a	Despite all the yuears that have passed , Counter-Strike is still one great online shooter that is fun and challenging to play . However be warned : You will be killed countless times until you master this game .  Final Score : 8/10 ( Great )  Full video Review :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap_HeTcwY2c

3988	1	a	Amazing game ... cs forever...will never let u die \m/
4359	1	a	The multiplayer FPS that started it all. Might be a old game, but its better than COD, also, even though the graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥, that doesnt mean the game is. Instead of picking your loadout, you get in-game money to buy weapons from a menu. There are no attachments to the weapons. There isnt THAT much to say, but its still very good. Final Verdict 10/10 Classic.

3092	1	a	This first person shooting game is quite good. but the developers might have worked on the Bugs. Its pretty much addictive. Best for LAN gaming, less suitable for Internet gaming in India
4322	1	a	Game on!
1303	1	a	Still a great game, worth playing for anyone who likes the Counter Strike games. Don't let the outdated graphics turn you away from this, who said graphics mattered anyways right?

4909	1	a	Hands Down. It's Counter-Strike the GOD DAMN SEXY Half-Life Mod. No Other-Mods that makes HL into an AWESOME Multiplayer FPS Game. Introducing Bomb and Defuse , Hostage , etc.   Pros :  - Gameplay is Fun!  - A Hell lot of Server  - Large Community ( did i said large. i mean â¥â¥â¥â¥ing huge )  Cons :  - The Steam Version doesn't have Bots ( except cs:cz )

The game is excellent, but other versions of Counter-Strike is also awesome:) The very rare I go because I play Counter-Strike: Source, and other games .I advise everyone to play.

2331	0	a	I remember playing this game on WON. This was one of the best games on the market until GO came out. I've wasted so much time playing this game and I regret every second of it. Waste of time and it'll turn you into a homeless nerd with no friends.
1221	1	a	I've been playing CS 1.6 since it's release in 2000 and I haven't stopped since, it's a great game.
3728	1	a	Been decade since it was released but still rocks ;') memories
2325	1	a	It's csgo without skins.
733	1	a	that was fun.
1311	1	a	Hands down the best Counter-Strike ever made. It have the fun in it that no other game have. The feeling when u play for a example a Warcraft server. The time you put in and playing that game for so long. Don't buy CS:Go. But this sh*t 10/10
4694	1	a	What to say...? BUT THE GREATES GAME EVER!

4268	1	a	This game played a huge role in my childhood :D Still the best fps for competitive play, but unfortunately steam ruined this game with the latest updates :(
5065	1	a	the best game in the world
4894	1	a	One of the games I've played the most since year 2006.
2236	1	a	i was told to be done with it through  Closed shutters, flooded floors, i wanted to sail out the front door.  morning anew I'm counting the texts you sent me  I'm trying hard to take this well, but the cradle has been rocked and my feelings are a stir.  and I'm not really sure how to approach this landing despair  and so many eyes on me, i felt like commiting suicide  open the door, 40mph, dead forever more  and so little time, we we kids just exploring,  trying to find a way out of this surburban story   And that my friends is an Emo song straight out of the state of New Jersey. Taking back sunday? Thursday? Pffftt this is way more garbage tier than that.
161	1	a	I've been playing this game since 2004, this game is mind blowing awesome. If you're not looking deeply into graphics, but just want to have fun playing, then this game is for you. Multiple gamemodes, will keep anyone amused. If you don't have it, then what are you waiting for? Get it now!
3228	1	a	BEST GAME! :)
2779	1	a	Very cool and balanced game. Superb gameplay and unbelievably good for tournaments. Once you've played it you'll never regret it. The only bad thing about this game is the community. It's full of scrubs, lamers, scammers, spammers and hackers. Its very hard to find a good and clean from all those dudes server, but when you do find it, you will forget all about them and will enjoy all your hours of play.
42	1	a	:)

4267	1	a	This was, is and will be the most popular First Person Shot game ever. I rly dont like the new one GO version of Counter Strike. This is legengary game and it will be active and popular for many years from now on.
1608	1	a	Very Cool game

4727	1	a	Counter-Strike its the best game ever :X
1999	1	a	Its been 7 years i still play this game. I dont know why but i attracted towards gaming because of counter-strike 1.6. This game gave us many great moments in cs history. I know people nowadays play cs go but they should know 1.6 is father of cs go. PURE OLD IS GOLD !
426	1	a	Old School Rules B-)
3515	1	a	^^
3256	1	a	Classic..
1129	1	a	The original Counter Strike came out in 1999 and is still good. El Classico. If you can find a chance to play it, I would highly recommend it. Unlike it successors, you can feel and hit crisp shots that just aren't available in latter versions of CS. 10/10 Would recommend.
2526	0	a	we cant play single player with bots anymore? not recommanded 
3375	1	a	I prefer a preemptive strike, so I start each match by swatting all of my enemies.

2253	1	a	why is my counter strike not working ? if i getting in it its shows all big and if a press something its goes to my home page i can open the console but i don't know any commands
3164	1	a	This game is very good to play on low-power PC since it is old and it even can make you better at CS:GO since the basic gameplay mechanics are extremely similar. I use this game as something to do with my ADHD hands while listening to music which i find to be great (just turn the game sound down and join a Deathmatch Server)
3707	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6, it's neccessary to say anything else...
2462	0	a	If you were a fan of this game back in the day you'll feel nostalgic and want to buy it but don't, it doesn't hold up if you've done any gaming of any sort since then.
3417	1	a	+
3481	1	a	Old but gold
403	1	a	Nice game, i recommend it!
4214	1	a	Very fun game, graphics are disappointing and just not nice, I personally live in Israel, Israel has a lot of multiplayer servers and their sons loads admit most enjoyable so it makes up for the graphics ...  Also has the option to fight against bots you can practice with it or simply pass the time, I wish there was such a nice single player.  So in short, if you are looking for a game with many Indians, multiplayer servers, easy and fun then this is the game for you!
1512	1	a	This is my childhood game :) thanks Counter Strike's developers for developing this such a great game!
2309	1	a	A classic and always will be! must get for classic game lovers!
1961	1	a	It's a great action game , my early playing game. I like the action, the maps but I don't like sometimes becase all players are buying AWP and then the game is so boring. If I were the programmer of this game I allowed only AWP on the team. Another thing is that in game must be a leader , to focus the action of all team.
3391	1	a	Is Nice game!!!
2439	0	a	i liked the part where i used to own this game on my steam account.  i dislike the part where i logged in one day for the game to be gone from my list and steam refusing to give it back to me even tho i have almost 1k + hours played on this account? HOW CAN I PLAY THZE GAME IF I DIDNT OWN IT?!?!?!?!?!??!  â¥â¥â¥â¥ u steam

1222	1	a	Game Of the Century It is.
3550	1	a	I love this game 10/10
805	1	a	Counter-Strike is the mainstay of competitive shooters, with the kind of prestige the likes of Call of Duty strives so hard to achieve. A number of gameplay modes ranging from what used to be the highly popular VIP to the traditional hostage and bomb maps, to eventually leading directly to two now-released sequels and one upcoming release leaves plenty to keep one busy.  'Remember your roots.'  With simple designs to keep things tight and easy to practice (yet nearly impossible to master), Counter-Strike proves that a good shooter can stay in the forefront for over a decade.

Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role. Dont think twice BUY IT . You will not regread.
2139	1	a	In my opinion, I prefer this one over CS:Source. Not that CS:Source is bad or anything, it's just the newest update that ruined it. PS Teamwork is highly recommended. Also! Don't forget to get this and CS:Condition Zero (Which comes with this and it's only $10 for 2 games in one ^_^
77	1	a	This was the first game I ever played, and the game which made me love gaming.   Bless you, 1.6

4815	1	a	The Start Of it All...
681	1	a	You look at the GUI of CS 1.6 and you think what a lovely eyes they have &lt;3
3135	1	a	Wat can i say, if u love fps games, playing with friends, having fun, crusing people and saying evey better player who is better than u a hacker....then this is the perfect game for u :P
354	1	a	This game... Lots of memories. Lot of spent time playing this game in childhood, still having nostalgic feelings. I still play this game sometimes and it still makes me happy. c:
412	1	a	This is not a game. This is a life.  I'm so sorry that there are too much cheaters on servers, but if Valve can make it better , it would be great :D Remember old good times, waiting to start a new match between Na'Vi and fNatic &lt;3 And all other teams... Then somebody made a cheat, and destroyed a game. This game changed many lives, many people. I think this game become the world best game ever. For me, it's the best game. I play it every day, but it isn't like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isn't. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.  Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CS:GO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him : ' Why did you bought that ? Isn't it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats? ' He told me: ' I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now. '  I don't know why are you doing it, this is beautiful game. When I played it for the first time, it was awesome :D Finally a game that I can play with my friends on LAN. And, till today, I'm playing it. I never downloaded a cheat. I don't need that. I want to learn how to play, to be the beast in the world... Now everyone is wanting money, money money... I heard about CS:GO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...  It will never be like sometimes... Or we can change everything...  Valve please, get this game back to life &lt;3  Thanks.
3828	1	a	This game is pretty much just as good as Counter Strike Source just with older and outdated graphics and sound. You can play Counter Strike 1.6 with bots by getting Podbot MM:  http://podbotmm.bots-united.com/main_pb_page/index.htm  . A great game!
1952	1	a	This is the beggining of what we call 'modern FPS'. This game is pure skill. If u are a CoD 'aim down the sight' fanboy, don't try it, you're wasting your time. This game is for skilled players only. No aim. No help. Just your and your target.

5018	1	a	No words can describe this amazing game.....
1497	1	a	One of the best multiplayer-shooter ever! A real must have! Unforntunately 90% of players are cheating :( So sad!
3179	1	a	It can run on my beast Windows 98 Machine 10/10
3355	1	a	Old, but still great game. Good memories playing it with
3383	1	a	There's a lot of potential in this game, Valve please don't leave it, we need your patches. Gaben, please add skins and destroy them cheaters with your almighty power.

2506	0	a	When you play Counter Strike, the terrorists win.
9	1	a	One of the best FPS Games, the 1.6 Version will stay always in our hearts. I recommend it vor everyone who wants a tactical/action shooter.
2939	1	a	Playing it on LAN with friends was great.
3830	1	a	In a nutshell: 10/10 - Really good game for being what it is, an old classic.  What is Counter-Strike? - This is basically SWAT team simulator 2000, it's a pretty competitive 5v5 FPS shooter where you must stop the terrorists from a range of objectives, such as rescuing hostages, defusing bombs or killing terrorists before they plant their bomb, even escort missions where you must escort a buddy to a helicopter! As terrorists your goal is to well, kill the Counter-Terrorists, to put it bluntly.  Will it Run on my Computer? - Considering my cheap Lenovo G580 with integrated graphics can handle this at 60fps, unless you use a really outdated PC (like, a computer made before 3D games were commonplace) I'm sure your fine.  Parent's Guide - I'd say FPS games are generally a no-no for parents who care about what their children play, and actually, this game, if you go into settings and turn blood off, its actually not too bad, I'd say 13+ is appropriate.  Graphics - (Note: This game was released in 2000, excuse what is terrible graphics nowadays), pretty good graphics, all the characters are in pretty good detail and the guns look nice and pretty realistic-looking.   Gameplay - I will say, it's quite fun, but I will tell you, this is a game meant to be played with friends or meant to be played with players who are good at teamwork, your entire team could lose simply from one player on your team not going with your team's plans.  Is it Worth The Price? - Yes, absolutely, if you want to see where CS:GO started, get it for sure!
94	1	a	Still the best CS ever made!
2804	1	a	One of the best FPS multi-player games out there, a must buy
3943	1	a	The Legend !
117	1	a	The best FPS game in history !

3992	1	a	Great!
2428	0	a	When u buy it u are happy. when u have play counter strike in a 1h u will â¥â¥â¥ kill u self
2523	0	a	What was probably considered then to be the definitive shooter it has now become a boring somewhat empty game with either pros or trolls. 6/10
1411	1	a	This is the beginning. This is where all started. Awesome game of all times.  Up until CS:GO came out, no other FPS shooter compared to this games phisics.
4004	1	a	Great FPS game.Yes, it has not the best graphics, but if you want to have a nice aim, ÑÐ²Ð°Ð¶ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ 1337 Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¾Ð², nice game collection and etc. you should buy this game.  It doesn't have any achievements, but i gurantee that you will have fun there!
2595	1	a	By far the best FPS game ever
3957	1	a	It is one of the best FPS games ever made. Graphics does not matter, it is all about the gameplay :)
2219	1	a	this games so hot, i rub myself too it...
200	1	a	The best game of my childhood
1537	1	a	Where are the cases, and no knives? 0/10
2409	0	a	Need Update
3172	1	a	I really like this game.
3978	1	a	play hard go pro!!!!
178	1	a	..:)
2378	0	a	People say its a classic, Classic is the mod for half-life.
2371	0	a	I got banned from this game in 2002 by VAC just because I logged in from a computer with hacks installed in a LAN SHOP. It has been 11 years since I was banned and I still can't play Counterstrike with my account. I am already 25 this year, even prisoners in democratic nations are given 2nd chance but not STEAM. Shameful!
4429	1	a	Play it every day ! &lt;3.
4426	1	a	One of the best shooters.
2752	1	a	Nice game :D
4901	1	a	it is my â¥â¥â¥â¥
592	1	a	Winners Train, Losers Complain.
4313	1	a	hello games cs 1.6
4839	1	a	Still the best CS ever made!
4215	1	a	Have been playing since 6.5 and there are still 12 year olds flaming me in voicechat 10/10 for tryhard authenticity
2719	1	a	Its old and the graphics are outdated... But screw that! This is really fun to play, even though there are tons of pros
2238	1	a	Best classic FPS ever!
1577	1	a	10/10
3547	1	a	I played a couple games, seems fun.
5045	1	a	CS:GO is defiantly better, but this brings back better memorys.
4844	1	a	It's good.
3856	1	a	Almighty Game of All time !!
3969	1	a	Old but GOLD
3632	1	a	Good old game. It can be used (by servers) as 'sandbox' for creating FirstPersonShooter prototypes (which does not work in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive). It has simple mechanics which you can learn in few seconds and you can keep getting better (for example with bunny hop). There is only one big problem - cheaters. But it can be solved by playing only on VAC secured servers.
3534	1	a	amazing game 100% action
890	1	a	Pssss!
1648	1	a	MINIMUM: 500 mhz processor, 96mb ram, 16mb video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection i dont even have a video card what blasphemy is this 11/10 everyone is better than me
1008	1	a	Awesome oldschool game.
3170	1	a	An original classic, Counter-Strike. Even though on my old account I only had 400 hrs compared to my 1,200 on Source, This game was still amazing. Now, CS:GO will take over, but I still enjoy playing 1.6 every once and a while.
2961	1	a	after reinstalling steam ALL SERVERS ARE LOST!!!!!  Sometimes cant find servers...
4707	1	a	Well, the graphics hurt the eyes, but the gameplay is still pretty decent.
1631	1	a	Best game ever...And will be forever....
496	1	a	:)
4181	1	a	the mother and father of all fps games!
3827	1	a	ABSOLUTELY BETTER THEN NERFED CS GO.ABSOLUTELY I PLAY CS FOR 11 YEARS AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WILL SAY RECOIL CONTROL WAS BETTER IN CS 1.6 THAN IS CS GO RIGHT NOW.â¥â¥â¥â¥ CS GO.6 HITS -98 WITH â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SILENCER ARE U â¥â¥â¥â¥ING KIDDING ME
4113	1	a	!!! OLD BUT NICE !!!
512	1	a	Very nice game
4628	1	a	I've started the game with the version 1.5:)
961	1	a	Counter Strike was the first FPS game i fell in love with. Game play is superb.
1077	1	a	I think pie is good I think.... you can't sue in case this is wrong... :D This is a good game...
4540	1	a	The most generic games in world...Ever
1381	1	a	Good game.Classic's !
297	1	a	Just buy it !!
1872	1	a	Got VAC banned 11 years ago. 10/10
1194	1	a	That is a very interesting game, a very nice shooter game.
3088	1	a	This game I don't like because they are all using a cheat... Otherwise its good :)
1576	1	a	I buy the AWP and I win.  I recommend this game whole heartedly.  10/10
2267	1	a	*_* 
1548	1	a	remember ! if u shot to wall on de_nuke or whatever map, u will get double kill or annother lol kill on annother map xD fkin hilarious &amp; bay for noaimed pro players, this can be callled start ramp to csgo. Coz u dont need aim there &amp; csgo also.
2465	0	a	This will always be the best counter-strike ever, but I can no longer recommend it. 90% of servers are hosted by mexicans so if you don't know spanish.....2bad... Try CS:GO or CS: source.
2659	1	a	I've been playing this game for 10 years, and it's still my favorite. 10/10 stars!
2120	1	a	just a good first person shooter. nothing great but for its time its good
2473	0	a	i want my money back , i don't like the game!
5182	1	a	13 years now and i still find myself playing it occasionally. And now on steam too :)
3048	1	a	Counter strike is and will always be my favorite game. Spent a good deal of time playing, still learning how to better my self.
4563	1	a	Awsome
1794	1	a	This game is THE best action shooter ever made, it's gameplay is very well balanced and you have many options and tactics to do.    Actually, if you play CS:GO, then this game is exactly the same except that the graphics are from 2000. But this does not matter. Gameplay is far more enjoyable then graphics!   And if steam was built aound this game, well, then it must be some good stuff.
814	1	a	Got VAC banned for using hacks on an empty server, 10/10
2750	1	a	Can't get enough of this game, even after 12 years!
1712	1	a	just like skyrim but with guns
2747	1	a	The best
2089	1	a	Life is 1.  CS is 1.6   :)
234	1	a	Not long before this game becomes yet another timeless tale of gaming's glorious past, and far from dead is that past.   Newcomers to PC Gaming: Point is, it's a classic, and mandatory if you own a PC. So in short, straighten the hell up, ignore your idiot friends nagging you for a game of League or DOTA or BF4 or Planetside or whatever other garbage you've convinced yourself is good, and start from the ground up when you build your collection.
4816	1	a	Better graphics than Witcher 3
83	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 ruined many hours of my life!
3913	1	a	Best game ever after 1.5, which is best game after 1.3
2957	1	a	game for nerds ,bad story line.
2569	0	a	This game has its ups and downs but I can't stand playing it because of this damn resolution. Damn. I suggest getting cs:s or cs:go. Counter Strike original is good but there are no active servers. If you're buying this game you should also go get a subscribtion for ESEA as well.
4324	1	a	One of the most awesome games ever to exist. I recommend it to everyone who likes FPS games.
5224	1	a	Counter Strike is my life.
1424	1	a	Invaded by ethnicities with bad computers and awful ideas with their server management, it is now impossible as of today to get a decent match without paying for ESEA, even in PUG servers.  Not being racist, this is what actually happened. Surf servers and Fun servers finally died around 2011, whilst vanilla servers that ain't running dust 2 all day long died before Steam even came out, and all that's left is a bunch of latino-controlled servers with â¥â¥â¥â¥-awful maps and enough plugins to give you a seizure and a thousand hats.
3241	1	a	This Game Is Best
1190	1	a	Definitely a classic game, where it all started. If you're into CS then you must pickup this game and give it a try!
4608	1	a	WonerFul and interresting game
2501	0	a	This game is so bad that if you play it it will suck your will to live.  Yes, like in Waynes world.  Yes, it will suck.
944	1	a	Really really nice game to play with friends =)
4897	1	a	Game is good for any lower spec PCs, but may have a little lag. Overall a decent game.
4249	1	a	Working on Debian as a charm, even with Xorg's radeon driver! :-)
2016	1	a	My precious ;P
4748	1	a	Classic! nuff said!
2548	0	a	its bad, because im banned
5014	1	a	Write a review for Counter-Strike Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others. Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.
4633	1	a	...
3379	1	a	If you have ten dollars to spare or if you get it in one of the valve bundles or in a humble bundle or something to that extent DEFINITELY check it out. I may only have 75 hours on this as of now but I used to play it all the time before I knew it was on steam. If your a person who doesn't mind graphics but likes counter strike I would definitely buy it because, while I don't necessarily like classic on this version all of the custom maps and game modes make well worth ten dollars. *Alert* A lot of the gun names and the amount of guns is pretty different from CS GO but there are probably guides and once you get past your first hour-ish its fine.
1869	1	a	\o
4729	1	a	Much fun, surf, HNS, deathmatch, zombies, causal mode, Clan matches and so on! Good game! ;)
4220	1	a	Best FPS of decade!
2430	0	a	CAN'T EVEN CONNECT TO TO A LAN GAME. LET ME JUST GO KILL MY SELF FOR A SECOND. no offense ,but i hate this. ITS JUST A PRANK BRO.
1228	1	a	Counter-Strike is beutiful game when i play with my friend's and i get more new friend's
2756	1	a	&lt;3 this game :p XD :D
3206	1	a	A very well made FPS. The grand father of CS:GO  It has a lot of bugs indeed but sometimes it's cool to play with a bunch of old friends :-)
2703	1	a	one of my favorites!!
3716	1	a	The game is 16 years old and is still the best Counter-Strike. Eat your heart out Global Offensive.
4149	1	a	Really good game for its time! if you have a time machine, go back in time when it was popular and buy it!
2286	1	a	Addicted since cs 1.6
897	1	a	Play It :)
1866	1	a	A classic. That is the best way i can describe this game, but if you only played CSGO or even CSS and then you decide to go on a nostalgia trip to test the game, prepare to feel like you are in a very alien environment. The 2 hours that i tried, yes tried, to play the game were filled with learning the controls, adapt to the different recoil and aiming system in geral and then dying over and over again by the more experienced players  I recommend the game if you want to expand your gaming history horizons and give it a try, but you can expect frustration and rage. Its a piece of gaming history and it should be preserved as such, but new gamers will probably never get it.
1723	1	a	The start of something magical. Nice nades, Gabe.
2190	1	a	  Its not just a Game.......................... 
1996	1	a	cool
5137	1	a	Good game, and thanks to OpenGL can run on a toaster.

1366	1	a	Awsome :))

4953	1	a	Best game ever still to this day.
1314	1	a	hye, thats prettu guud
1652	1	a	OMG YES!!! This is the real cs not like CS:GO wich was ruined by valvE. This is still 100000% no mod game at starting and you decide if you want mods. If you want to try Counter Strike YOU HAVE TO buy this game at first!

2287	1	a	Nothing to say But Best Classic FPS!
1549	1	a	beast
4518	1	a	Counter Strike is a classic game. Fun, addictive, and customizable. It's incredibly easy to mod, texture and map for so you could expect a whole lotta mods.  Pros: -Great gameplay, bit of a learning curve but it'll become second instinct soon enough -Servers are still up, even for such an old game it still has a whole crap-ton of servers.  -Modding community is GREAT -Cheap, as in really freakin cheap, not indie game cheap, but still very cheap Cons -Most people who you will play with have been playing for longer than I have been alive. Expect to get pwned very very often -Netcode is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, adjusting settings using the console takes a hell of a while -People are sometimes way too serious when playing -For Graphics junkies: Graphics are pretty damn old-looking (what the hell do you expect it's GoldSrc)  While it's not a perfect game it still provided me with tons of fun and I love playing it. It's a bit slower than CSGO and the weapons behave differently.   Conclusion: If you want a nice classic shooter that's light on the pocket and the computer then this along with Half-Life should be in your library
1022	1	a	1.6 is and forever will be the best game.
3703	1	a	Just good, old Counter-Strike, same as it always was.
2135	1	a	nice game but needs a workshop.

1231	1	a	Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP. And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always, GL &amp; HF &lt;3
422	1	a	Its the best game i have ever played!
3776	1	a	One of the best games of all time, still worth playing!
2467	0	a	  Is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive worth to buy?
284	1	a	Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.
691	1	a	This game ruined my life but its the best fun i ever had. Would recommend for everyone. 10/10
3821	1	a	You wanted to know what your big brother did in your old pc? Did he watch porn all day like you? did he play something?  This is the answer

408	1	a	Playing with people within this game made me a bad person.  Playing with people within this game made me reetarded.  Playing with people within this game has formed a tumor inside my brain.  Playing this game will make you a homosexual.  And you will like it.
707	1	a	If you want to learn Spanish, play this game.
3463	0	a	This game was amazing but now it feels really clunky and pointless interms of gameplay. There is a safe way of playing this game and that is to spray like crazy. Sense this game is very old headshots are far to easy to land making sprays all the more cheap, you are litterally being rewarded for being a reckless player.  if you want to get a better feel of Counter-Strike just get Counter Strike: Source. Its pretty much CS but fixed with a better physics, online sync, and better hit detection.  This game doesn't hold up with games today.
3331	1	a	old and best !
3965	1	a	Loved the original CS, actually quit playin when csSource came out, wasnt as hooked to it and missed it ever since. Came back to try csGo

1459	1	a	  Worth the Purchase in Every Regard
119	1	a	Best Esport game of 21th century .   Good :   -easy to play -no cheaters ( maybe 10% if you play on random pubs) , in CSGO 60% cheating. -best game for tournaments as 5x5 -not boring , you can play again and again to improve ur skill  Bad :  VALVE did not support number one online action/esport game before die  was a lot of bugs   9.7/10  Recommend!
2830	1	a	Very recomended.
4271	1	a	recomand ))

2349	1	a	Best game ever, good old times :)
2738	1	a	Man awesome game been playing for years now thats all i can say :)
3931	1	a	I put probably 5,000+ hours into this game between the ages of 12 and 14.
2018	1	a	Unlike other FPS's from 1999 this one still has servers.
1913	1	a	Just 'Counter-Strike' ! King of FPS games. Nothing more, nothing less ;] 
475	1	a	I don't think the original Counter-Strike needs an actual review, so I would just be giving it a recommendation. Consider this review a mere recommendation.
358	1	a	A great game!!!
381	1	a	A Very good game indeed..... proves that graphics dont matter, gameplay does
3183	1	a	Counter-Strike is just simply one of the best FPS games out there in the PC Gaming Industry! Trust me, it's really worth buying! same goes with it's sequels :D
4382	1	a	a no-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t old shooter that is actually fun to play. Get it.
1088	1	a	Probably the best damn game ever made!
75	1	a	A game that is so much fun and nostalgic.  Brings back so many memories.   Always in my heart. &lt;3  10 / 10 - Still fun nowadays.
2751	1	a	One of the best games in this world !!!
4017	1	a	the standard in FPS.
2661	1	a	The best 'Never get bored of it' game.....
268	1	a	A must have classic for every FPS player !
2542	0	a	Best FPS team-play game ever made untill CS:GO was out. There are too many cheaters and cracked players that are spoiling all of the fun out of the game. Besides, the game itself is way too old for me.
2993	1	a	Only played a little, but it was fun.
357	1	a	One of the best fps games out there, tho' the graphics arent as good as the current gen games but this is a worth to try game. Playing this game for like 4 years or so absolutely incredible game period.. :)
5088	1	a	^^
4380	1	a	a very good game 
1981	1	a	I could find more honour in fighting an enraged bear whilst simultaneously eating the â¥â¥â¥ of my cheating ex. Buying bullets was a good idea 15 years ago, why are you still playing this game? Go get shot in real life and die if you enjoy thinking you're that hardcore. - my review in the style of the baiting you will learn to love when you play this game.

5112	1	a	It's a classic. No more words.
1585	1	a	No ranks No smurfs No cheaters No russians No headshots in leg No 57 in 8 (Glock) Deagle has better accuracy than awp 10/10
811	1	a	:)
1336	1	a	Still the best Counter Strike ever created to this day.
784	1	a	n1ce gamer 
263	1	a	This Game I'm Playing Forever! :)
168	1	a	One of the first games I played, brings back so much memories.  And its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun.
37	1	a	This game is awesome.  + still a lot of full servers from all countries  + you can find many friends in this game  - Unbelievable ugly graphics (â¥â¥â¥â¥ that. this game is 15 years old. )
2148	1	a	Great Game i like the gameplay its just like source  Rating:  10 out of 10
2765	1	a	great one!
4122	1	a	Excellent action packed dynamic game, where you get to test your reflexes and meet and play online with your friends!
5249	1	a	Counter-strike is my number 1 game of my life this is the first game i ever played and i'm still playng it 2006-present
2730	1	a	Classic~
3963	1	a	Some old school shooting :D
4819	1	a	Having only played CSGO for the past year or so, it is really nice to see what that game was rooted off of. I now know playing 1.6 what all the hype about Counter Strike is and the history behind it. 1.6 for it's time period was such a benchmark game. Really awesome!
3410	1	a	No â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  11/10
5034	1	a	i can't leave this Game forEver &lt;3
1953	1	a	getting 6-7 FPS .....lagging like hell....-_-....steam sucks......ma config is 1 gb ram , cor 2 deo, 1 gb graphic card
2819	1	a	Best multiplayer FPS ;D
2302	1	a	the nostalgia is real 11/10 
5240	1	a	Old is Gold! Love this game! GO CLEAN!GO PRO!
2350	1	a	Howdy partners, y all â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s need to grow da â¥â¥â¥â¥ up and play some GO.
3505	1	a	A classic blockbuster.
461	1	a	What is there to say, this game started the insane multiplayer fps mania. If you are interested in custom modes (zombie mode, deathrun, bunnyhop) or just want to check out the roots of this amazing series of games, you ought to give this one a shot, but if all you care about is dust2 24/7, you should get CS:Source or Case Opening Sim.   9/10
3994	1	a	you shoot things
3359	1	a	loved it since the first minute.
1339	1	a	Pretty much the best FPS evar!
1535	1	a	This game might be old but it's gold I really recommend this game very fun
3853	1	a	Best CS game of all time
4791	1	a	miss old times at HNS on cs 1.6
984	1	a	Best game ever :O! Finished it in liek 5mins tho
4482	1	a	Best! buy it ^^
2264	1	a	Counter-Strike is a game that I recommend because: - is one of the legends from the category shooting - is cheaper than the rest from the category shooting - is a method to banish boredom  - is a good method to increase your performance at aim - you can easy change the type of default skins by the skins from internet - have a fair VAC staff - and... why you don't try?  Enjoy!
247	1	a	(-:
1974	1	a	good old times!
3835	1	a	Dis â¥â¥â¥â¥ still better than CSGO
180	1	a	Loved it &lt;3
4823	1	a	This game is very old,but it is still one of the most enjoyable and played games.I read in a comment that,for gamers,the graphics aren't important,but the gameplay is.When we talk about Counter-Strike 1.6,it is very true.
2891	1	a	HELLO I HAVE PURCHASED CS ANTHOLOGY ,BUT WHEN I AM TRYING TO INSTALL TO UPDATE STEAM IT ALWAYS SHOWS FATAL ERROR ,THERE IS NO INTERNET CONNECTION ,HOW CAN I RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IF I DO NOT UPDATE IT ,I CAN NOT LO GIN TO PLAY .PLS HELP ME.
4942	1	a	Better than csgo, 10/10 would buy again
4951	1	a	great game
4170	1	a	You will hardly find a better FPS game.
73	1	a	Still the best of counter-strike! :) keep it alive
3349	1	a	A very good classic old school shooter
692	1	a	the best game ever
220	1	a	Counter Strike 1.6 is a box with million unforgivable memories of mine inside. Great coop which you will never get bored by. Most liked deathmatch and zombie mode.
1468	1	a	So ez to ace hs w/ deag
2216	1	a	the best game!
624	1	a	I recommend this game :D

717	1	a	The Best Game &lt;3
1117	1	a	Surely a pick for fps gamers.
1808	1	a	10/10
2269	1	a	It copied CS:GO
3039	1	a	Conntect Cs.Capytala.Ro
3409	1	a	Cool game.Still from 1999 but still cool.
4294	1	a	I will â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kill myself if I end up playing it 
3280	1	a	this is a great classic from the 90s

289	1	a	better than csgo =P
2805	1	a	old school if you haven't played this game you suck
3447	1	a	Be the best, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the rest
2940	1	a	I have fun playing it :D
2312	1	a	Old but Gold.
3772	1	a	No matter how many new editions of this game will be released, this was the first.
2967	1	a	Counter-Strike, it is literally impossible to be a PC gamer and not know what this game is. They're all great. Go play them.
1357	1	a	If you like classics, here is something you should probably get. A mod from half-life released one year after half-life it is still one of the most played games in the world bringing players from all over the place to enjoy together. It has a rather simple gameplay and you're able to get most of it in a few minutes but at the same time it requires training if you want to be able to play well.
4144	1	a	old school game :)
5008	1	a	yep it's the original countre strike, be a terrorist or a counter terrorist and shoot points to score, beautiful smooth gameplay, much better than that crappy source engine updates, come up with a good spraypaint logo to reach the bonnus round, i like the surf levels as well, valve when will you finally listen to the community and make surfing an actual game mode? it is a very respectful game for it's age and i give it a good score in the end.
2278	1	a	ct is cute
2276	1	a	great game... got VAC banned from it cuz i have a non steam and steam version installed and used hacks and steam found out lmao
2693	1	a	!
2169	1	a	this game is a great game to play
3683	1	a	Awesome game,must buy it!
2095	1	a	Not Just a game but my LIFE playing since 2010 and it was worth buying my favorite game ever 11/10
911	1	a	.
3638	1	a	Cool game :D
310	1	a	This is a veru fun game :)
4114	1	a	Play this game
332	1	a	Black Magic
2039	1	a	I recomend this game for bad PC-s. 
758	1	a	  Everyone in this game uses the AK-47 and uses aimbot....
2093	1	a	Played this as a kid (lol) probably the best game ever made, and the best thing is - no cases no skins no ranks - skill is the only thing that separates you from the general mass
5030	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing high game
4305	1	a	One Of The Best Online Multiplayers Game to enjoy and Only the name is enough.
4626	1	a	This game is epic!
2468	0	a	There is no point in playing this game. I was banned for using hacks when I have never used any hack programs on my steam account. Wasted $10 for this game. Good luck
5255	1	a	Best multiplayer game I ever played.
368	1	a	so old, but gold.
3603	1	a	The best!!!!
588	1	a	Playing the original  (kinda, after the mod-play anyway)  CS game in 2015 has a certain nostalgia factor, bringing back fun  (&amp; sometimes bleh)  memories for those who played and supported it during infancy. 15 years ago, I couldn't have imagined Counter-Strike becoming the competitive FPS-gaming standard that it is today, especially with its latest leap into CS:GO. (Global Offensive, even while taking changes as they come, is the new favorite goose-- Carrying the Law of Newer, Faster, Bolder-- But even there, the core CS spirit &amp; experience is true. And always slowly evolving...)   It's good to look back at how far this franchise has come, as even with each controversial change or update, I know each decision is calculated with the desire to keep moving forward-- While  (hopefully)  staying as true to it's core as possible.   LONG LIVE COUNTER-STRIKE.  &amp; LONG LIVE DIXIE MAFIA. 
1472	1	a	great purchase and great experience! and yes, its awesome!
631	1	a	Only game that i never get bored of it playing since i was a child.  Best game in my opinion  1000000000000000000/1000000000000000
5205	1	a	)
2477	0	a	it's way too â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to play!
1265	1	a	This game is the most popular game. Play it all: children, men and even women :) Pros: nostalgia, simple gameplay.  Cons: Graphics decade ago.

2464	0	a	Does have some multiplayer, but all the modes are gimmicky and not fun. Not many english servers either.
2726	1	a	What better than a classic, there's nothing really left to say about this game. It's wonderful, totally worth of it's entire price, that isn't that much either.

2307	1	a	The graphics might be bad, but who cares? People said that Wind Waker was bad only for the graphics, but once you played it, it was AWESOME. Same with this game, the graphics might be bad, but what do you expect from a game that was amde in 2000? But once you play this, it's really fun.
231	1	a	Game which dragged me in gaming, as outdated and old it is, the best memories for me lies within this game. I mainly played because of mods, which were great, like Zombie Mod, Death Run and WC3FT Mod

1693	1	a	cool and good
3308	1	a	Its old and great game!
0	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.
3495	1	a	Awesome Game In My life I Am play!
719	1	a	Bhoping to yo mom's house since 1999
1516	1	a	  Very fantastic game Very fantastic game
1964	1	a	Decent game with low price!
2644	1	a	Pretty good game, like the CS- Condition Zero. Less noobs, more pros...Alot of people are pros like me :) (PT: Um jogo muito bom, como o CS-Condition Zero. Menos n00bs e mais pros...Muitas pessoas sao pros como eu :) ) 
1031	1	a	Best game of all times.
5081	1	a	Very good game, lots of fun! 9/10
147	1	a	Recommend delete Counter-Strike:Source &amp; CS:GO !
1414	1	a	Used to be my favorite game till I was introduced to CS:GO. This game is the basic for all the players whom have just started to play CS. They should slowly grow up simply by starting off from this game.
4723	1	a	old but gold, i really love this game :)
598	1	a	Old School classic
1814	1	a	#1 of all time!

3233	1	a	.
2630	1	a	One of the best games !
3522	1	a	dont change the screen to wide screen it just zooms in and you cant change it
31	1	a	Ah, this is where it all started from.. The mecca of online competitive scene.. I still remember bunking my extra classes, and play this game in a bunker of a gaming center, during my school days. I didnt think, that it would take root inside of me, that would fruit up, some years later.  Come the post graduation years, and I found myself playing this again, this time.. on a competitive level and making sure I had fun, the entire time I spent, whistling away at this ..  Fond old memories.. Still growing strong.. Still making more and more, as we keep walking through the life..
7	1	a	I met a lot of people who slept with my mother. 10/10
3318	1	a	Very good game. One of the best ever made, veterans will understand.
2305	1	a	One of the best childhood games i have ever played! 10/10 !
3973	1	a	Good game to learn how to aim :)
262	1	a	Great game, been playing for 11+ years.
2201	1	a	counter-strike is a good game for the most part, adding characters and stuff to the half life franchise and universe... there are several canon discrepencies, but they can be ignored for the gameplay and overall storyline (and even how that fits into the orignal half life game :D)  overall its worth paying for and playing...
851	1	a	The best game!
4915	1	a	This Is the best game in teh world. BUY IT NOW
3586	1	a	This was, is and will be a LEGEND &lt;3 This game started the era of cs

3533	1	a	Good Game But Need Upgrade...
3426	1	a	Old School
3516	1	a	I love this game ! It is the game of my childhood ! My opinion is the most successful game ever made valves team ! It's a game very well optimized 10/10 ! We recommend with great pleasure ! Worth every penny ! The nice thing about this game is that it can be played on almost any PC system requirements, it has very poor . That makes the most popular if not the most popular game in the world shooter . --Graph &gt; 6/10 --Optimizing &gt; 10/10 --Game &gt; 10/10
2112	1	a	Classic:D
4775	1	a	One of the best FPS games of all time. 10/10
1969	1	a	I cant aim in this
514	1	a	...
3071	1	a	Great FPS for the time, but I suggest you try CS GO it's about the same with better graphics and other little improvements.
1719	1	a	  This community is better than the CSGO community  10/10
2132	1	a	i love the cs series and valve game in general so i would definetly recommend all of the counter strike series
4461	1	a	Best cs ever ^^
1595	1	a	This game is still awesome.
4592	1	a	VERY NICE GAME ,low graphis
2389	0	a	Full hacks everywheres ..
1315	1	a	Best shooting game ever!
3625	1	a	Best Game Ever Played! &lt;3
2931	1	a	Steal good game
2165	1	a	Nothing beats a classic.
2360	0	a	DON'T FALL FOR NOSTALGIA BIAS  Pros: -classic feel  -people still play it(barely) -no skins(almost)  Cons: -80% of the players are hackers and do not speak english(so no real teamwork) -real servers with the gamemode actually being a CS type are almost non-existant -actual enjoyability comes from whether or not you like to deal with the above  This is one of gamings most treasered games and it is sad to see it get like this. Nostalgia can only get people so far and it is a shame thaat few people explain the reality of this game in their reviews. The fun is not totally gone, although it is something you have to really try to find. The gameplay is as you would expect it (at least when you find a server that doesn't have CSGO surfers on it), nothing has changed and thats good. The problem is the community. It is hard to find a server with a team you can communicate with because of the major language barrier the game now has.  Communication is key in this game as you would expect, and it is very rare because almost everytime you get on a server it is from a central american area and the players mostly speak spanish. Making it difficult as you would expect.   The amount of hacking in this game shameful, it is more common than it is in CSGO and is a real problem that makes the experience more bad than it already has become.  The server types are just like what you would see in an old game, modded to hell with new terribly unenjoyable game modes. If you were to see you would find many gameplay modded servers that give you trash that nobody wants to see (surfing).   Take away the nostalgia bias that everyone tosses out and you will see that this game is a former shell of itself. It has all the elements of a typical old PC game that only a few people will try hard enough to enjoy. The enjoyment can still be found, but at a heavy heavy cost. RIP CS1.
2402	0	a	This community is full of 12 year old horny fukbois who upload pictures with bad â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es      PSA:feel free to down vote this review because its the truth.
2500	0	a	This game doesn't have 7 day bans. 0/10
4777	1	a	The game of the games
4235	1	a	the best game ever, since 6 years ago playing this game.
1568	1	a	!!!!!!!!
1351	1	a	old is gold...awesome game
4343	1	a	Old School Awesome!
751	1	a	The Game itself might not have the best graphics a game could have now days but people still continue to play this game to this day because of how much fun it is. Online has a ton of game modes you can play including Kz,bhop,HnS,surf and casual along with many more.
1501	1	a	I'm into old games. Ye. c:
273	1	a	u don't have NoSpread lel, this game only for Legit.
552	1	a	Not much to say, really. The pinnacle of first-person shooters, that still manages to live on today. The community is not what it was, let's say, 10 years ago. However, this game still manages to be an enjoyable experience for anyone wanting a good old wholesome first-person shooter experience. Highly recommended, though if you haven't bought it until now, don't buy it, due to the lack of support from players, and the high difficulty of the online play.
2160	1	a	Best game ever made. Too bad volvo decided to destroy it and force us to play the pointless cs:go. Seriously, why not both? Why removing all the support and updates from the best fps game ever made?
87	1	a	=100,000 hours
4551	1	a	Best Multiplayer Game Ever!!
170	1	a	Thanks valve for â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up the game. still awesome though.
2788	1	a	$$$
1855	1	a	Counter-Strike has changed a lot from 2000 to (present-day) 2015. Even with the release of CS:GO, Counter-Strike 1.6 still remains a favorite for me. There are still many dedicated servers with ten or more people in them. The graphics are outdated of course, especially in maps like nuke, but they still look decent on a few maps . This game is the beggining of one of the game series out there. I would give this game 8/10 and would reccomend this to any retro-style gamer! ;)
1025	1	a	awsome game
2783	1	a	Cool game.
3325	1	a	I purchased the Condition Zero Pack and I am very impressed by the game. The only thing is that You should'nt charge the same price for this as just the standalone game. Still one of the best games ever though!    10/10
2454	0	a	DO NOT BUY! Steam is up to their old tricks again. I thought this had some sort of controller support but it doesn't. Steaming Pile of Crap. I Promised myself I would never buy another Steam game again but couldn't resist the prices. Un-Playable.
474	1	a	Old but gold. :)
3461	1	a	forever classic
3285	1	a	Old but gold!
476	1	a	condition zero is better from its community which is mostly 40 year olds, this is full of sqeakers so its kinda cancer you know? haha.
2438	0	a	The community sucks.
296	1	a	This game us so funn.
3881	1	a	Game that started it all!
2517	0	a	Cant connect to any servers Reasons: Fake client i was on idle And other reasons I JUST GET KICKED AND ANOTHER ONE THE SERVER IS FULL BUT NOT! I rate this 1/10 its good but the servers man and wheres the bots? WASTE OF MONEY
4792	1	a	Best Cure For Impotence
3350	1	a	Is a super first person game ;)
40	1	a	More than 15 years and yet best FPS ever made.
467	1	a	Been playing CS since 2003. Despite what the box on tactical ops says no really it's not better than counter strike. CS is the best first person shooter in my opinion. The reason 1.6 is better than GO or Source is because it's about player skill not graphics. The hit boxes are much better. In order to be a great player you need to know how to execute movement even bunny hop.   Best game ever.
4688	1	a	Best game of all the time.Classic
3745	1	a	You're a member of Steam. If you don't have this in your library, uninstall and buy a console.
4530	1	a	just the best of the all games in the world 
2980	1	a	My first game ever purchased, it will be in my life forever :)))))
195	1	a	Old school,lost half of my life on it.GG
4756	1	a	Cool game ^^
3116	1	a	.
4325	1	a	+
1183	1	a	Still, there is no any game like this one. Full of fun :)
4443	1	a	:)
2964	1	a	Old School
4355	1	a	This game is just awesome!
4959	1	a	+1
4471	1	a	Classic game very fun.. everyone should own this game 
1044	1	a	^^
4612	1	a	Even though i was VAC Banned (seriously don't remember hacking or anything).  This game is still better that CS GO and CSS in my opinion. I don't know how to explain it, i honestly think it's just nostalgia. But i don't think i will ever hate this game...  As the other games. Counter Strike has ALOT of gamemodes (Zombie , Deathrun , Hide 'n' Seek , etc.)  I would suggest you buy this game if you like CS GO or CSS
3720	1	a	Old is gold~
700	1	a	+++
4890	1	a	Counter strike one of the best multiplayer first person shooters out there even though it came out 14 years ago it still has outstanding graphics a good level design and alright player models  i would recomend this game to anyone with a spirit to play oldschool shooters
4578	1	a	good for wasting time
1774	1	a	Nothing U can say about this Addictive Game :D &lt;3
4128	1	a	coooool and awesome game! worth the money!
3217	1	a	The first ever Counter-Strike game that started it all ! The game that marked a generation and taught us that we can run faster with a knife,you will not regret buying this game.   Score: 10/10
506	1	a	best of the best &lt;3
2304	1	a	Still great game I hope CS will live on forever :D 
2592	1	a	I am gonna counter your strike.
529	1	a	life = 1.6
4022	1	a	We all know Counter-Strike, and we all played it at least once. We all love it, and we all still play it nowadays. Great, fun, working on any PC, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ or new gen. Great game.
1114	1	a	its nice game,buy it and make sure
808	1	a	Love this wonderful game, it's also my first game on steam and still it's my favourite.
1895	1	a	1 of d best games ever released :D
4803	1	a	FIrst game in inventory!
2144	1	a	One of the best games ever made
3838	1	a	Old but still good
1891	1	a	This game is a an amazing game and at the beggining your going to suck hard but you get good at this game and iti really fun
1240	1	a	A great game to play, if you are used to CS:GO this game will have a massive learning curve to it. The style CS 1.6 has developed is very different than from what CS:GO needs.
4076	1	a	BEST GAME TheDoctorE
2598	1	a	Most competitive game !!!
3253	1	a	It's K.
4995	1	a	Counter-strike is like a fine wine. It gets better with age. That is to say, the more time goes on, the higher quality players remain, resulting in a great game today.
2518	0	a	Second worst FPS game i have ever played after CSGO
4502	1	a	I recommend this game
1659	1	a	best game of all time
2265	1	a	Dust, the video game!
4138	1	a	It's an oldschool classic!
4843	1	a	Want to enjoy a FPS but don't want to spend 14.99 on CS:GO or Call of Duty? This is a great game for the price, Pretty much the same as CS:GO but not as good graphics. Lots of people still play this so it is still fun. 10/10
167	1	a	it`s ok.:)(2k14) Edit:It`s ok?!That`s all i had to say then? Kinda unfair, given that this is the game of my childhood. Was i a normal grill who loved to spend her whole day with friends back then when it was still OK and actually encouraged to play outside? YUP. But was i also a little geek who couldn`t wait to get back home from school and viciously murder anyone in my path of winning the match?Hells to the yeaah. Note: Can you believe i`m in Medical school, after all of that?  Rainy day cs-playing is the best thing in the world, hands down. This game never gets old.If you haven`t played cs, you`ve lived for nothing. Peace!^^
2427	0	a	Waste of money!!! Bought it recently downloaded just yesterday.. when i open, all i see is a blank screen!!!!
1	1	a	â¢ Do you like original games? â¢ Do you like games that don't lag? â¢ Do you like games you can run on low end PC's? â¢ Do you like games where you don't meet children who have slept with your mother?  Then this is for you!
4609	1	a	if you never played counter strike before  get ready to be scrubed on       you nub
245	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!

1297	1	a	Been playing this game for 5 years plus and it isw still absolutely fun. Quite in fact a better game than Counter-Strike source or Couter-Strike condition zero. Great Gameplay (Scrims or for fun) Many mods I've played are quite good like Zombies, Trouble in terrorist town, surfing, and jailbreak. All are very nice to make the game relavent and quite new. I highly recommend thisw game.

2668	1	a	Classic. I and much of the community moved on to Source or CS:GO, but this game will always be fun. Back when this game wasn't on Steam, a couple of friends and I played this on LANs. I still revisit this game from time to time, half of it for the fun, and half of it for the nostalgia.  There is still a very active multiplayer community so you'll definitely get your money's worth. Get some mod's, make some friends, have a blast!

4369	1	a	The game that started it all (well, almost)... simply a classic
1601	1	a	Seriously Counter Strike is awesome all of them Go,Source,The original all amazing! So go on buy them...im serious....do it...NOW.
520	1	a	All good old Counter-Strike. Still better than beta CS1.0, 1.1 and 1.5 with a few new standards and fixes, but now is a new age with a CS:GO, cuz CS 2.0 we won't see soon enough. :)
1619	1	a	anyway is better than go
401	1	a	hmm. trying to earn a few batches.
489	1	a	-This is my opinion your experience may vary-  counter strike a name that almost anyone will recognize. Before I played counter strike I knew that it was a game loved by thousands even millions and that people play it every day.  =The Graphics=  this game's graphics are good (IMO) and it may not look to good by todays standards, they hold up just fine.  =The Gameplay=  The gameplay in Counter Strike involves starting out with some money to buy equipment, you earn more mony by killing members on the opposing team rescuing hostages, deactivating bombs, or plant and explode the bomb, also 1 life per round so work together.  =My Verdict=  I love this game the people who play it are pretty cool most of the time and the game can really suck you in and $10 may be kinda steep in for a game this old but it comes with  -Counter Strike -Counter Strike: Condition Zero -Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes  wich all come in the $10 asking price and I would give this game a 9/10

1105	1	a	A classic game
3411	1	a	One thing I need to comment on. Why can't I customize a game and play with bots? Besides that this game is a gem obviously. Playing on the italy map led me to buying csgo, and I can't even get bored of it. My gameplay was on another edition not from steam so don't pay attention the gameplay hours.

2466	0	a	it's a great game, but i don't recommend because nowadays there is a map rotativity of just two or three maps
2334	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2687	1	a	I don't need to say anything about this masterpiece.   CS:GO has been out for 2 years now. As a long time CS fan (Yes the hours on STEAM are short but if they logged the data on my game disk there would be at least 3000 hours on it) Counter-Strike 1.6 just gives me a certain feeling none of the later CS games give me. Listen, if you happen to be reading this because you are thinking of buying it, get it. It will be one of the most action-packed amazing $10 you'll ever spend.
2818	1	a	This is my fav game and i like it so much .. its so good .. u should try it
3045	1	a	Ayyy guys :D It's nice game if you wanna warm up or train your aim imo. It's more difficult than CS:GO.

5259	0	a	having fps issue since 2-3 days ...before that everythng was running smooth any solutin ? tried vsyn 0 fps maxx 101 any other solution ?
3948	1	a	technically the 2nd in its franchise, its one of the best online shooters even to this day, i personally dont like CS franchise not cause i suck â¥â¥â¥ at them but i dont see the fun in it, i want to have FUN playing a game, and this just does not deliver it for me, but....i do recommend it highly
3033	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 is easily one of the best shooters out there. I have good history of making teams and playing against other teams or just having fun with friends in public servers. It was out of this world when it came out and in my opinion had the best professional scene at the time. I played it on and off for about 7 years.   Bud sadly CS 1.6 doesn't hold up for me. Until playing CSGO I was still very into the game. After playing CSGO for few months I tried playing CS 1.6 again, but the graphics and shooting mechanics are just awful at this point, it just doesn't hold up.  If you are new to gaming or just Counter-Strike, you should probably skip this game and just go right to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It's an amazing upgrade from an amazing game.
4387	1	a	#1
96	1	a	It's an verry competitive game with a lots of acction and a lots of mods. The old school shooter.

4483	1	a	What can I say, nostalgia and a great childhood. This was one of my first games back on my old steam account when I was around 8. I hardly remember my first experiances but I remember staying up and playing this all night once(first all nighter :3). Of course not just because of nostalgia but excelent gameplay, excelent movement, and perfect balance. 10/10 
841	1	a	the game that started it all..
385	1	a	Good game no scamms like in tf2
1893	1	a	'Very Good' ~l0ln0a -2k16
4649	1	a	Hands down the most addictive team-play based game out there.
387	1	a	We will never forget about 1.6 , at its time this game was not only a game , it was a sport , a purpose , a way of living , i've been playing this since the beginning(back in 1999 or 2000 can't remember for sure :D) and i don't know what the world of gaming would have been today without it , so Counter Strike will always remain the king :D
4888	1	a	in my opinion, this is quite simply the best multiplayer fps shooter of all-time
1244	1	a	One of the best First Person Shooters on the planet still to this date!

4834	1	a	CS deep on our hearts since 1999! â¥ Is not outdated at all, is the same ex-girlfriend that wants to suck the life out of your being.  I also recommend CS GO over Source:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/730/  Spread the love! ;)
4926	1	a	!
4960	1	a	This game is byfar one of the best fps game I have ever played! I remember when I used to play this on the original xbox and had so much fun playing it. I was really sad when my controller broke and I couldn't play it anymore but soon after that I got the xbox 360 and started to play COD and GTA. Then, I started playing on PC and all I played was Minecraft until I downloaded steam and I found Counter Strike. I had no idea it would come with CS:CZ so I decided to play it and it was more fun than CS. I enjoy to play this game and I'm sure that I will continue to love this game!
4758	1	a	This is by far one of the most fun online shooters ever. If not the best ever made, And in my opinion the game that pretty much started the genre. Ive been playing the game off and on since it's release and still to this day it never gets old. The game runs really good on modern pc's and it's really a game that when your doing good you really feel a sense of accomplishment. Plenty of fun maps to play on, plenty of servers to play on, plenty of customization options. This is one game that you can really taylor to suit your style. Plenty of user created skins for your weapons that can really make this game look amazing. And I still prefer counter strike over counter strike source. I don't know, call it nostalgia or whatever but there really is something about just good ol' counter strike 1.6 that is just simply magical. It truley is a classic in every sense of the word. And STILL is just as enjoyable (if not more enjoyable) then any online shooter on the market today. So glad I got to grow up with this game. I would definitley recommend it to any fan of competitive online first person shooters. Come Join the fun.
4868	1	a	its ok if you don't have cs:source.
3658	1	a	Had this game as a kid alongside Half Life without internet connection and no bots. Basically had nothing to do with it except roaming around.
402	1	a	Old but gold !
1581	1	a	The other Counter Strikes are just a game (good game if you prefer)! THIS IS COUNTER STRIKE ! THIS IS IT ! ITS THE ONLY COUNTER STRIKE ! PLAY &amp; KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN WHEN YOU'VE BEEN KNIVED ! *** NOTE:Check My Review of Half-life 1, its a long review and its actually all about counter strike ! i give this game 10/10 Reviewed By IMMORTALEADER

527	1	a	The best competitive multiplayer FPS experience for low end computers. Even an old laptop can run this probably. Bit of a learning curve with weapons. Condition Zero expansion has Half-Life style campaign though not as groundbreaking, but also additional mp maps and a singleplayer bot mode that is goal oriented and challenging.

1559	1	a	Very old FPS with an awesome AK-47 recoil (Í¡ Í¡Â° Í ã¤ Í¡Í¡Â°) I play it on a potato at +69fps and I die cuz I'm noob. So wat ? Buy it and get me if you can. (ï½¡ââ¿â¿âï½¡) I'm recommending this game if you play on a Pentium IV with your r3t@rÄ friends. Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯
5231	1	a	This game is not new player friendly becaus there are only competetive player left in this game or over all hard mods to understand. Counter strike Global offensive is much more new player friendly so I recomend you picking up that game insted if you are new to counter strike.  but for you guys that know how to play cs you can pick up this game though it is prity hard to find english speaking servers and servers with no mods.
2329	1	a	It's the original CS on Steam! You just can't go wrong with this one.
1641	1	a	It's ok, i guess. 10/10
4372	1	a	Get the complete pack when it's on sale and you can play some fun maps with your friends !
1243	1	a	Really good, skill game, I spent a lot of hours playing this game (Not on this account), probably better than CS:GO. :)
155	1	a	cs the best
3747	1	a	Tried it, kind of liked it.

2600	1	a	Great game! This game shows you how FPS has evolved into one of the most popular game genres. This game is old, has not many multiplayer servers and has graphics that aren't the best, but I assure you that you will have some fun with it. If yoiu are getting this game because yiu are looking for a good FPS, buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive or even better Counter Strike: Complete.
118	1	a	So i buy this game to become good at counter strike but i don't good because 1.6 is hard so i buy source to become good at counter strike but source is hard so i buy global offensive to become good at counter strike but i become silver 1 and realise game is not hard... life is hard and friend once told me to kys (kappa your soul) and i think it is great idea! Any way if you good at counter strike game it is fun if not deinstall game because if you're bad at game you are bad. Overall great game but also bad. Yes thank for read!  Btw Paradise Hillz is ugly â¥â¥â¥â¥. Thank for read!

3950	1	a	Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role. Also zombies HnS (jumping) kreedz jumping ) deathrun run through obstacles and crap 
3624	1	a	Wow this game was not even the smallest bit â¥â¥â¥â¥
860	1	a	most awesome game &lt;3 
353	1	a	Best Game ever. I love this game. I am playing for 4 years and now also i am not get bored :D Best Shooting game ever :D
2524	0	a	Honestly it does nothing to explain to the player the concept of accuracy and it ruins the experience, how with just a crosshair am I expected to understand the difference between it being a little wider and a little narrower. Its a fun shooter don't get me wrong, but the whole crosshair â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t is bad and should have been reworked instead of kept in every CS game
1412	1	a	old is gold ^_^

610	1	a	Game of my life
2222	1	a	all time play!!
2855	1	a	There really isn't much to say about this game that most people don't already know. It is a classic in any and every definition of the word. Although the graphics are now considered quite dated, it somehow doesn't change the appeal and visual accessibility of the game itself. Perhaps newer gamers and people trying it out for the first time in today's gaming world will never develop a bond that veteran CS players will forever cherish with the old school counter-strike, but for us, this game will always be the go-to first person shooter and will endure as the trend-setting sage of all future shooting games to come. Rivaled only by the likes of the Battlefield series (though obviously not comparable as they are essentially different games albeit being first-person shooters both), counter-strike is an absolute treasure and for the pennies you could snatch it for, it is definitely worth your while as well. If you do not have this game, please buy it.
987	1	a	ITÂ´S COOL
1761	1	a	has better graphics than cod ghosts. the mountains outside in nuke look like giant piles of meat patty. 10/10
3281	1	a	...
4246	1	a	Classic.
5163	1	a	Hi. I have played thousands of hours of CS 1.6. Since then we have had CS: Condition Zero, CS: Source and now CS: Global Offensive. Which one is the best one? So, i still find CS 1.6 to be the most addictive, but the technical limitations are maddening by today's standards. For example, the detection of whether a player has been hit on 1.6 is just not accurate and it's frustrating. Yet that may be one of the reasons why 1.6 is so addictive.
2318	0	a	i used to play cs before since 10years ago. but this cs i purchased it sucks. can't play properly.. that's why i wanted to refund. even the settings cant fix it.
3565	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
4274	1	a	.
2310	1	a	Best FPS for Valve. I love this game. You should really buy this epic game and its franchise.
2340	0	a	Only â¥â¥â¥â¥ing brazilians play this game.
1822	1	a	it's like cs.go but better   ...  k@pp@
1442	1	a	  :)))
5143	1	a	The legend game that have existed for 10++ years 
4106	1	a	The best game ever!
1020	1	a	This is surely thes best and funny game I have ever played.
3041	1	a	Great game, a real classic
1326	1	a	Oldest Counter-Strike is the best, because people play 4 fun, they want to be better and better. People don't play to upgrade their 'ranks' like in CS:GO.
4706	1	a	Great game.
5192	1	a	its orite innit. i shoot things they stop moving their faces
724	1	a	Best game that i have ever spent my money on, no words.  Countless hours spent on my early days, and now that i have a new account and bought this game, the nostalgy is flowing.  If you ever think about buying this game, do it. Its worth the money.
4760	1	a	Great.Nice Game But server has bug still
541	1	a	This game will be forever in my heart as the best first-person shooter of all time.
5212	1	a	Maybe comeback
3659	1	a	Better than GO
3108	1	a	Classic and still played
5043	1	a	Aswesome Game Loving It &lt;3
5135	1	a	The best real FPS ever made!
4375	1	a	revolutionized first person shooters
1443	1	a	Old but gold
97	1	a	Classic of Counter-Strike. The best game for more than 10 years. If you've never experienced it, just get it.  100% recommend.
4548	1	a	Best Game that Valve ever created!
373	1	a	The chat was overfilled with people blaming for hacks.  I like it that way.
3312	1	a	Old games are always the best games and this is no exception.
4310	1	a	source is better still fun tho
4509	1	a	Gameplay: 10/10 LAN Fun: 3/3  Good Servers: 2/7  Counter-Strike, perhaps the most competitive game of it's time, hasn't aged well graphics-wise, but the gameplay remains more precise and consistent than most FPS games today. This game is a  great  LAN game for get-togethers, but otherwise you may have come too late on perhaps one of the greatest games of all time. Servers that I have connected to show that I have horrible ping, and the lag assures me of that. I have come across a server or two that I can connect to and enjoy, as well as being vanilla-CS, considering all the servers that mainly run modded games (which is about 4/5 of the servers). So here are the reasons to buy the original Counter-Strike:   Pros  -Can run on a potato -Plays smoothly no matter the settings. (However, you can connect to a server somewhere in Latin America or the Middle East, and lag like heck.) -Great fun to play with friends, as it can get really competitive, but at the same time your friends may not have this ancient gem, so this is dependent on the situation. -Solid gameplay. Nothing else really compares to the precision that went into it over the years. -Large map selection, as well as custom-maps found all over the internet. -Mods, but many are not as good as some of the others. You have to dig through garbage to find the fun ones.   Cons  -Very few good servers -Hard to convince people that don't already know how great this game is to buy it, considering it's more than a decade old. -So...many...sound...file...downloads...from...servers... -Custom maps are very rarely as balanced as maps packed in with the game.   Verdict  If you've got the money, and are curious as to what this legendary game is like, then it wouldn't be a complete waste, but if you are coming here from the latest CS or CoD or Battlefield, without having played other older FPS games, then you might regret the buy because this is a game that is quite outdated in terms of UI and such, and might not be appealing.  Overall 7/10 now, after more than a decade since release.
427	1	a	Old but Gold . ^^
1484	1	a	No FPS will ever beat this one . Enough said.
5216	1	a	I Love The Game !!
1505	1	a	=)
4475	1	a	A real classic game. I lost track about how many time I've spent playing CS
3833	1	a	When will steam sale start?
3190	1	a	i remember when i was in high school playing this ahhh the good ol days where you could play a match without being threatend to be swatted anyhow carry on playing the game
2330	0	a	My negative vote is for this Steam version only. CS 1.6 is a great game but for some reason valve removed bots and the main menu music in this version so I can't recommend getting this version.
1818	1	a	Counter-strike(1.0 - 1.6 not source) is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does
783	1	a	Great game
383	1	a	BUUUM ! Head shot!
848	1	a	The best game ever :x
3390	1	a	This is the game I grew up on, and it still has active servers! If you needed a hint, there it is. Go buy the game and at least see what old games used to be like :)
1295	1	a	This is one of the greatest games I have ever played, full of modifications, active and cool!! Can't say more.
2877	1	a	5/5

1376	1	a	Just recently started playing this game. But so far it is so much fun, have not played it with friends yet but when I do it will be 10 more times the fun.
2071	1	a	I Recommend This Game.
3937	1	a	Classic, a must have for shooter fans.

4021	1	a	This is most skillfull game!
1195	1	a	What i like in this game: Gunplay, good gun sounds and they give suitable physical impact, although animations haven't aged well ;) Teamwork/cooperation aspect, not very complicated, no real different player classes, but obviously a sniper won't go to assault tasks with the primary weapon at least Highly customisable, skins, sounds, textures, makes this game fitting for so many different kindsa players with a relatively little effort  Then, things i don't like in this game: Graphics, that's the only thing really, but the good thing is the simple old graphics make everything clear to see and distinguish
4875	1	a	One of the first few games that had introduced me to PC gaming (and love for first-person shooters). This game is timeless.

2111	1	a	Well...... I started playing this game about 9 years ago, now I'm 16, but this game is still one of my favourites. I really enjoy playing this game with my good friends. In this 9 years, we had a good time. It has been a legend to our generation.
65	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.  Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.  Rating 8/10
3592	1	a	Yes!! awesome, best childhood memories. 10 years and still playing.
2369	1	a	Good Game but dont play if your donald trump lots of mexicans kinda unplayable cause whenever i join a server i gotta revert my controls or i get sent to another server and will do it mid game sometimes kinda annoying
986	1	a	Great game, still many people play it and is very good.  8.5/10
1378	1	a	Back to the classics! Never forgetting the thousands of hours I played this game, looking through every mod and searching for tons of unofficial versions of the game, because I couldn't afford it. I started playing 5v5s in Source and now I am searching for PUGs in 1.6 too. It will be so fun when I find some!

2300	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP escort: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion. A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as 'freeze time') to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral 'buy zones' that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.  Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).  The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.  Killed players become 'spectators' for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as 'ghosting.'

2482	0	a	16 years after it's release people are still palying it, which, in my opinion, says a lot! People are dumb as â¥â¥â¥â¥...
1360	1	a	Recommended

307	1	a	 gather-network.com  - CStrike 1.6
1671	1	a	The best game in the world, the jipiroca is going pew pew.
2268	1	a	simply 'EPIC', a game which words are unnecessary to describe!!!  I give : '10000000/10'
416	1	a	pretty good
1355	1	a	Best game..Start playing and you end up having addiction to this game..
4115	1	a	This is the most beautiful game I ever played!
2664	1	a	This is the greatest FPS of all times !
4605	1	a	In my opinion: CS is the best game ever made! CS 1.3 was my personal favorite update, but 1.6 is and always will be amazing. I still pub a de_dust2 server daily.
774	1	a	Counter-strike is an amazing game i have pretty much grown up playing this game it never gets old totally in love with the game , you can pick it up pretty cheap way worth the price for all the hours of fun you can have check it out !

1407	1	a	CS 1.6 4 life!
1543	1	a	Have a PC that you bought in the 1990s? Want the discount global offensive experience without the crate opening bullsh*t? Do you want to play a true first person shooter? Are you looking to impress your crush with shooting skills although you don't have any? Do you want to appear like a whiny edgy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in front of your parents while giving your friends lessons on when to rush A or B?  This is the game you play.
3749	1	a	Old but still good, easy to roll and hundreads of server. Recommended for first person shooter players.  'Old but gold.'
4920	1	a	I just &lt;3 this game !
2735	1	a	Counter Strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential.  You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought.
5054	1	a	Well, this game is kinda old school, but still gold, like this, i'm playing it like from 2009, but i'm still likeing it.
555	1	a	^^
4646	1	a	This is the game that ruined my childhood ! I literally was playing it all day long ( previously was playing on non steam) It was one of the best games back then, but now CS:GO has taken its lead, so i recommend you buying Global Offensive.
2232	1	a	Recommended
4192	1	a	Good old game , Altough its old , we still love it , and we still play it. Its counter stike :D ! Give a thumbs up if you agree with me
831	1	a	Old but gold.
4857	1	a	I recomemend Counter-Strike 1.6 and my servers if you are from sweden you can get admin from 10 kr - 20 kr.
2272	1	a	The best game. :)
1119	1	a	Since 1999 till todays date 2016 THIS GAME IS LEADING GAME IN THE WORLD  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 But Ruined by CSGO :D :D gONNA LOVE IT TILL I DIE
3752	1	a	Absolutely insane... this game is eternal... playing it for almost 11 years and there's still community.
1773	1	a	very good game
3809	1	a	Nominated this game for steam awards, as I belive that its one of the best games that will never get old.
1006	1	a	I spent almost 3000 hours in this game. Yes, it's that good xD.
4780	1	a	nice and good game !
2096	1	a	Probably the best game in the world.
453	1	a	+++
2055	1	a	Graphics gave me cancer  11/10 ign
2094	1	a	The source of cs gamess :D  +rep
1454	1	a	Old is gold!
4976	1	a	Play to Counter Strike 5x5
3709	1	a	Back in the day, this was one of the games I spent the most hours playing. All day, everyday.
3062	1	a	I do not have much to say on Counter-Strike/CS:1.6 but with it being the first stand-alone game modification for Half Life using the (Gold) Source Development Kit it turned out pretty well even in the 1.0/1.5 mod, oh yes and the hostages on 1.0 where scientists, due to the fact the developers didn't make some hostage NPC models in time for the release and the Hostage models where still NPCS and came out later in 1.6. And during Beta Version 4 (B-V4) Valve became interested in the game that was being developed, hired the developers for valve to help make it better, and in a few years the original developers quit making the game and let Valve take control of it. If you like the classic First Person Shooters from around 1995-2002 this is basically the game for you. Also you can shoot through almost every wall with every gun in the game. I give this game an 9/10
2186	1	a	The Best for ever
3224	1	a	1.6 the game i was competitive in :)
4051	1	a	bad file consistency a rha h cnt play :/
4957	1	a	A great competitive game, with mostly a great community! I love this game and I really managed to make some new friends :).
3472	1	a	purty decent
2844	1	a	:)
1334	1	a	BEST GAME !!
345	1	a	Wanted a physical copy of this game , rather than purchasing it online, to leave my children a memoir of one of the gr8test games in history, but anyway... this will do the trick more or less. +1 , the only game i really knew how to play and i really enjoyed playing.
190	1	a	This game is perfect for shooter gamers.
806	1	a	A classic is a classic. Long live 1.6.
2626	1	a	Damn, I love it. One of the most addictive game.
4948	1	a	This game is 10/10
2899	1	a	The legendary 1.6. Worth all the money, eventhough there is cs:go and css. BRILLIANT!
4771	1	a	I love this game. There are so many options for servers. You can play the normal CS or you can play on a modded server. can was so much time in this game &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
367	1	a	This Game Is a classic master piece. And has AMAZING replay value. As a young gamer my self growing up in a world where most casual gamers are xbox humping, cod playing, graphic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. It is shameful that this game is not played. This game made and broke friendships and made a childhood for many people. Even if you dont play the game often. Please just get it for it to be in your library. 8/10 for some bugs and a now strange community. But nonetheless a great game.
2284	1	a	Spent 80% of my early life on this game 5% of the people i've met there were russians  100000/10
18	1	a	  Pros  - No crates which you can waste your money. - You don't pay for the extra maps. - Less Russians. - Less cheaters. - Very alive game (after 16 years). - More than 11, 000 active servers (according to Gametracker).  - You don't need actually PC to play this (you can run it on a Calculator). - More mods than games on Steam. - You can spray in the game. - You can buy MP5. - You can use Flashlight and Nightvision. - You can choose a character. - You can play Assassination mod. - You can use Bunnyhop. - You can play CSGO MOD.  And other stuff I can't remember....
4344	1	a	Still the game that has had it's share in building the foundation of multiplayer gameplay. Really one of the first games which demanded tactical gameplay, good aim and sometimes a bit of luck to be victorious.  Though the community is not that big anymore, you should ask yourself: 'Can you really call yourself a gamer if you haven't played counterstrike?'
886	1	a	Counter-Strike is #1 game is world))))))))))))))))))))
5109	1	a	 http://GameTracker.BG 
4353	1	a	still a awesome game!!!!!!!!
766	1	a	i wanna add bots how's thaat ? 
3126	1	a	Been playing Counter-Strike for years, although I've never seen a Counter-Strike game in which the 'Terrorists' are caucasian I must say they're still fun games. The X-Box version had the 'terrorists' be oriental, which made me question the game slightly, but it does not ruin the fun factor. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys games. Why buy 'COD' when you can buy this wonderful timeless game that doesn't cheat you of your money but makes it worthwhile, get bored? Lots of custom servers to play. Enjoy.
868	1	a	Best classical first-person shooter game of all time.
4027	1	a	The most popular action game in the world !
4602	1	a	I've played this game for years never forget

2556	0	a	Graphics are trash.
1386	1	a	Better than CSGO Why? Less Russians  No Hackers Guns does not do fast aims Less rage than CSGO But bad graphics and low quality 8/10
2708	1	a	''Old but gold.''
838	1	a	Best fps game ever - hands down.
4189	1	a	Its really a one of the fabulous game i have ever played
57	1	a	Best competetive game of all time.
4197	1	a	This game is such an original classic, its graphics were ahead of its time back in 2000 and still dont look that bad, the gameplay is what that makes this game such a hit, the gameplay is straight to the point for a shooter. The gamemodes are addictive and i think all of them are just as good as the other
5058	1	a	Not very many players online, but still a fun game. I play this when I get bored of CS:GO.  My only gripe is that somehow malicious servers can override your controls. For example, a server overwrote my keybind configuation so that every time I pressed w, it would connect to their server.
1791	1	a	Greatest Hentai I've ever watched 1/10
177	1	a	if you don't know about this game then i feel bad for you son. i got 99 problems, but this game aint one. this game is my childhood. get it.
3579	1	a	start the game ----------- get into a server---------------first round------all the server starts to say fire in the hole fire in the hole firf rifrifrfirfirifri ------------ the awp scope is made in paint app --------guns are useless sub guns are useless too --------- the game is AWP and m4 and ak-47----- any thing els suck  but still love it 10/10

3087	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
579	1	a	Classic.

1113	1	a	Once loved it, now, full of cheaters, VAC doesn't work like it should, people uses illegal CFGs, scrolls, scripts, ducks right in front of you, you were once a great game... 10/10 would still play it if remaining players didn't turn out to be such illegal noobs.  Back in 2002 THIS WAS THE GREATEST GAME
395	1	a	So many years with us, but still the best game ever. :)

3777	1	a	The game that never gets old...unlike me :P
5220	1	a	There are 3 games in the Counter-Strike series. There is Counter-Strike Source. Then you have the middle aged brother out of the group, Counter-Strike Condition Zero. Sure these two updated and improved versions are some what good. But the oldest brother is the best. Counter-Strike 1.6. Thought it is the oldest out of all the three, it seems to me that it's the most played and respected game out of them all. I mean sure the other two may be fun. But there is no match up to what the real game. What I mean by this, Counter-Strike 1.6 is the orignal and by far best Counter-Strike ever made. So basically this game may be old but it is the most played and fun out of the three.   Reason being, Counter-Strike 1.6 has the most active and filled Steam Community. The legit and good players of the Counter-Strike series have stayed with the old school. Even though 1.6 may not have as good as graphics as Condition Zero or Counter-Strike Source. It is the most played and talked about around the gaming world. You dont see big gaming websites talking about Condition Zero events. There are no big major Condition Zero events. All of the good and legit players are basically all playing Counter-Strike 1.6. Sure there is some talk about Counter-Strike Source. But non the less, Counter-Strike 1.6 takes some skill to play and become well known as a top notch player. As in Counter-Strike Source there are many messed up things with aim and registration. So really even the slitest baddies can get somewhere with Counter-Strike Source. For as in Counter-Strike 1.6 there is a good amount of skillz needed to play the gama. Atleast to play good.   Soon I hear that a new Counter-Strike is coming into play. Sort of a combination of all three games. Condition-Zero, Counter-Strike Source put some play into it. But see they do not use anything from Counter-Strike 1.6. Theres another good reason why this game is going to be just like Condition-Zero and Counter-Strike Source. Sure people may play the game for a while when its comes out. But all in all Counter-Strike 1.6 is going to be the best Counter-Strike game in the series. Like stated earlier graphics dont matter to me. As well as they dont matter to real gamers. If you play a game cause of it's graphics, then im really sorry to tell you that you are not a real gamer. Its said but true. Games are never about the graphics. Its what the game is and if people enjoy playing it. Sure graphics are sometimes nice. But Counter-Strike 1.6 does not have the greatest graphics in the world and it is one of the most well known and played games in the whole gaming world.

2296	1	a	this game is like 10 dollars get it
2441	0	a	I love CS as much as the next guy. But you will have more fun with Counter strike: Source or Counter strike: Global offensive. Why do i say that you may ask? This is filled to the brim with hackers nowadays to the point where it's basically unplayable. I personally like the classic feel of CS, but Counter strike Global offensive is still fun in it's own way. Get css or csgo. You'll thank me later.

4896	1	a	Terrific...and best FPS Free Gun Game :)
2449	0	a	No good quality servers, and most people are hackers or get a cracked version of the game and threaten to DDOS you. Get CS:CZ, CS:S, or CS:GO because they have bots to play with if you can't even find a server. Might have been good 15 years ago but now it has been left to rot.

Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.

3718	1	a	Best FPS game i've ever played, so many fun gamemodes!
16	1	a	First of all its my first online game ever. I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never. For others its only a game for me it was MY LIFE! This wasnt a review but a little story.  SO COUNTER-STRIKE FTW â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ES!!

2273	1	a	CRapp but i will play it more and more and more and will teach my kids to play in that crap more and more and more.
2901	1	a	good game but can be frustrated! :D
2508	0	a	One will find it is quite easy to encounter persons of highly polished skills in the original version of the Counter-Strike games. This is evidenced by thousands of hours on many of the players records; keep in mind that Steam has not been tracking game hours for a good few years after it first came out with this mod!  I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.  One would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest, 'sexiest' version, anyway. After all, the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer. I also recommend passing over the current middle-child version: Source.
1299	1	a	This game is awesome
3202	1	a	Best shooter from 2000 till now. Like everything.
4025	1	a	Fun times in the good old days.
793	1	a	I love this game.  All of my teammates always say nice things about me. They never tell me they slept with my mom. And the best part about my teammates is that if I get bored of them, I can reroll new friends and even give them cute names. I can even convince the other team to only use knives while I mow them down with machinegun fire. My teammates even protect me and use their body as bullet fodder. And if I get mad? I just type something in the screen and they all die for me so I can win.  It's the happiest and friendliest game on earth.
2678	1	a	The game is very fun for its age and I have had a lot of fun playing this. This game means a lot to me and to some of my friends. This game was my first ever multiplayer game when I started playing it in 2007, when I didnt have steam and had to pirate it, sadly. I'm fairly sad that it is dying, but it had a good run. 10/10
3800	1	a	This game is the sense of my life !
992	1	a	:)
4767	1	a	Good game &lt;3
5012	1	a	eh, classic

4750	1	a	Classic, I like it just as much as CS:GO and the community is great. No competitive option for normal players, but still fun when playing with friends.
1380	1	a	The best game valve made after Cs:Go but the updates made the game very poor :( wish it could be like in the past
822	1	a	Good old calssic cs

3305	1	a	Great
3201	1	a	One of the best FPS's ever created, while obviously being old &amp; CSGO being the new stuff, there are still small &amp; nice communities left on 1.6 making it worth playing still.
1796	1	a	Awesome game, kept me addicted for nearly 10years
4	1	a	Every server is spanish or french. I can now fluently swear in both languages 9/10
4991	1	a	Counter Strike is an first person shooter that was released in the late 90's.  Whats it about?  Well Counter strike is an online first person shooter where you either play as an terrorist or an counter terrorist.  The terrorists objective is to transport a bomb to a bombsite located on each map marked as (A) or (B). Whilst the counter terrorists main objective is to stop the terrorist force from planting the bomb.  Theres also a gamemode where the terrorists will have hostages and the counter terrorists objective is to rescue the hostages before the time runs out.  Game ends when the counter terrorists has saved all hostages or the terrorists has whiped all counter terrorists.   Is it worth buying?  Since this is an really old game and the graphics are really outdated compared to the games we have today i would still say this game is worth buying.  The game is over 15 years old but still has a alot of active players and playing with friends make it even better.  Counter Strike also has alot of maps, mods and other stuff that makes the game better in any way.  Graphics. 7/10 Sound. 8/10 Gameplay. 10/10  This review is based on my own opinion and noone elses!
3812	1	a	  I woke up with VAC ban, for no reason
1340	1	a	This game never gets old. The only thing you can improve is your skill 10/10.

2948	1	a	This games is a very fun and compettive. At first you gonna a be a noob but if you play it for some wile. You will get used to it and be unstopable
2448	0	a	Counter Strike is even fight between highly trained American anti-terrorist team using latest in military technology to battle a group of really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ madmen possessing crude bomb and surplus from USSR 1980's army supplies. Despite all training and technology terrorists still have good chance of blowing up market therefore much like real life.  Game is currently full of hackers who fly on top of map so unless you hack or like getting aerial teabag please play better Counter Strike Sauce or Counter Strike Go game. This game has had its day and only exists for historical purposes. I remember times when internet cafe and mosque full of this game. No more.
3503	1	a	This game, this game, this game.  This game is still alive at the moment im writing this.  This game is amazing and should really try it out. I bought a counter-strike: condition zero disc in december 2004.I lost it in 2006,found it in jan 12 2016.Wrote the code that was found in the disc,then i got this game and condition zero and counter strike:condition zero deleted scenes.  When i found this game, i couldn't be more happy in my life.
5206	1	a	The timeless classic that forever changed the world of first person shooter.
2666	1	a	What can i say, the all time greatest. Just buy it to support the e-sports.
2075	1	a	There is only one thing I would like to know about this game. Why is there an Auto-aim option in the mouse section of options. I have never tried it and I don't know if it works but I just think it is strange.
4681	1	a	good game, I guess.....
3321	1	a	yes this is the â¥â¥â¥â¥
420	1	a	The best Game ever~

106	1	a	Played since 1999
3564	0	a	Ehhh its okay
3401	1	a	No R8 revovler, 10/10 would play again.
125	1	a	Yeah... the old Counter-Strike.... Everybody know, what CS is.. Counter-Strike - My rating - 9/10   Why or Why not to play this old classic ?  Positive:  ItÂ´s a legendary game, and if u playing games like CS:GO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library. Almost everybody played CS 1.6 'from start his cs:go career' Counter-Strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, thereÂ´s is some chance, that u cant play it (Win 8 etc).  Most of legens/proÂ´s in CS:GO played CS 1.6, itÂ´s like beginning, and it could be your beginning!   Negative: No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 (On CS:GO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc.) Graphic+Gameplay - Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZ:P Gameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CS:GO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CS:GO, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:D)  So... my opinion is: ItÂ´s legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/her:P steam library. :)   
2612	1	a	the best cs in the world
347	1	a	Very nice old school game.
5140	1	a	Just awesome!!!
1547	1	a	What can I say?  It's just the best game I've ever played, and it's my favourite game. So simple, and loads of fun, many mods, exciting, entertaining, utterly exciting and 'addictive', and there's always new maps.  There's many new games with better graphics, but Counter-strike is the best, and will still the best first-person shooter ever.  Oh, and I knew Steam by this game.   +10/10
1131	1	a	I get sexually aroused while playing this game.
3960	1	a	Nice game :DD
235	1	a	Seriously im playing this game because of kreedz mod and climbing other than that is â¥â¥â¥â¥ but still cool tho
888	1	a	This game is a proof that games do not need to have good graphics for it to be fun &amp; addictive. It's one of the games which gives you the oppurtunity to go online &amp; have fun with your friends :D
4594	1	a	recomand .
4014	1	a	Probably one of the best games that I have played in my entire life and I think it will always hold a place in my heart no matter how many other games come out and try to replace it. WON WHAT WHAT?
4561	1	a	SO OLDSCHOOL ONLY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥S CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
5251	1	a	it a nice game what more do u want HA im joking it a old school counter strike game and people still play it just damn
729	1	a	BEST AND THE HARDEST GAME EVER
1214	1	a	this is a good game
2636	1	a	âââ
3394	1	a	The golden classic. If you haven't played this game I don't know what is wrong with you. No, seriously... just buy this masterpiece and play it. The original Counter-Strike is still better than CS:GO. There, I said it. The player base might not be what it used to be but if you have a game that has around 50 000 active players a month on steam and is over 15 years old at the same time, you have a really great game. The graphics do not hold up to today's standarts in any way shape or form but that is to be expected. Either way the gameplay is still amazing and most of the maps are balanced.
1802	1	a	The best game ever. !
4590	1	a	A Hell Of a Game :D (Y) .. This Game proves that Graphics does not Matter .  10/10
1239	1	a	very nice game
936	1	a	This has always been my favorite and a classic to my collection. No matter what, I will always have this game.
1675	1	a	.
2935	1	a	I Got shot in the foot and died 10\10 For Realism
1426	1	a	I.LOVE.CS This Game IS SOOOOO FUN Too Bad The fanbase is dead for this game but i got csgo and cscz but when i hit Z,X,C It crashes So i recomend CSCZ
3282	1	a	10/10 still better than any call of duty game 
2652	1	a	  Underestimated it
2245	1	a	It might look like a tiny Half Life mod, but look closer and you'll see that It's got a lot you can learn. Takes time to be skilled at this game. Really fun to co-operate with your friends. Please, if you're a CS:GO player, try this game out!
5049	1	a	1.6 â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
3896	1	a	Very cool game)
1170	1	a	Comparing the game to CS:GO.    Pros:      Variation in lighting (darker rooms), along with flashlights and nightvision.    No background/ambient sounds in most maps (clear sound) (easier to hear footsteps and gunfire).    You can wallbang most things/walls in most maps.    Buying amunition (more depth in economical strategy).    MP5 ('nuff said)    Movement is much smoother and bunnyhopping is much more consistant and fluent, you feel much heavier in cs:go.    You can run the game on a toaster.    Character selection (I just think its pretty awesome).    Spraying (spray paint), boobs make for a great strategical distraction.    Customizing textures, maps, models ect. is great, you can mod almost anything you want, unlike in CS:GO.    No marketing system (skins), this one is a bit of a debate, personally I'm ok with skins (I've even spent money on it myself), but I prefer to mod a game rather than having to pay for a nice looking gun. Skins, simply put, are a way to milk the players money. Im thankful that CS 1.6 doesn't have this.    CS 1.6 has a classic/nostalgic feel to it, some people will like that, some people won't.    People still play the game, proving the game isn't dead yet.    There are many different and interesting modded game modes in 1.6 such as surfing, zombie, bunny hopping, jailbreak, deathmatch, gungame.     Cons:      Matchmaking in CS:GO is better, it is simpler and places you in a server with people around your level.    Grenade physics are awkward and hard to learn.    Viewing and casting games is much better/easier in CS:GO.    Few weapons are viable in CS 1.6, mostly just the AK, M4, AWP, Deagle and MP5    Sometimes bad/terrible hit registration.    Tactical shield.    No ranking system, personally, I don't care about having a pretty symbols with a bunch of arrows and stars, or having stupid rank names like 'SERGEANT MASTER ELITE SHOOTER PERSON', the only reason I'm putting it on this list is because ranking helps put players with other players that are about the level. In 1.6, any new player will find themselves playing against people leagues better than said player.    I did mention before that modded servers were great, but it can also be a problem, there are few classic CS 1.6 servers that aren't modded, most of them being deathmatch servers with 32 players, it's hard to find normal CS game modes.    Hacking is a issue in CS 1.6, worse than in CS:GO. It's harder to get VAC Banned in 1.6 and there aren't any features like Overwatch in CS:GO, to make it easier to detect hackers.    Servers can change your bindings and send you to other servers, this isn't a big problem as there are ways around it but it's still present.    The game no longer gets any updates, I know this isn't the games fault but there are still exploits and bugs in 1.6.   Some people will agree these pros and cons and some won't. I'm not saying this game is necessarily better than CS:GO, but it sure is a fun experience. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games, especially people who play CS:GO. The game takes a while to get used to but once you do, you will find yourself playing this game for days. I havn't played this game too much, so theres probably a lot I'm missing. That concludes my review.
3945	1	a	Good Stuff.
4130	1	a	.
5055	1	a	This game doesn't need a review.
4996	1	a	Awesome game of all the times
4306	1	a	Old but gold.
336	1	a	baws remains a baws B|.!  I love this game madly since 2004 and still there is much to learn. Although i left playing cs 1.6 for few years due to my study and then profession stuff but as usual, this game brought my attention back and i'm goin in RogeR!
2240	1	a	awsome game (y) my first play on 2004 no steam :p
3934	1	a	The Game Is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awsm:!
4298	1	a	Excellent game, thoroughly enjoyed it back in the day.
3959	1	a	very good this game.
4635	1	a	addictive!!!
1177	1	a	Nice fps game
4685	1	a	Great game ,nothing can be changed !
99	1	a	-Love to shoot people with real life guns with different names? -Have you ever dreamed to kill terrorists and even be a terrorist? -Love playing the same, universal map over and over just because it's the only map you'll ever know? (*cough* dust2) -Have you a desire to work as a team to complete objectives? -Do you know how to speak Brazilian-Portuguese and Romanian? (Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players) -Love nostalgia? -Love to have fun? -Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free?  -Love randomly dying from wallbangs?  Great, you've come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community (Which is still big for the old game it is) it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever come to play, and i've only had it for about a year, and i'm gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I don't even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community (for the most part) and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course there's hackers, you'll see a few of them, but they don't ruin the game. Either the server's admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, it's not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game. This game stands the test of time.  10/10 Would throw brick-looking grenades at terrorists again.
907	1	a	Dat cyber-cafe memories.
4135	1	a	Played from February 2000 - September 2004.  The one that started it all. The original.  G.O.A.T.
5223	1	a	:)
4365	1	a	Still ages well in many ways. In addition, it's probably the only GoldSrc game that still has players on it, and for good reason. CS's game mechanics are tried and true, and they still hold up despite two sequels and almost two decades. While CS: GO is my personal favorite, CS 1.6 is still damn fun, and given that it's an older game, you can play it on literally anything nowadays. There's a single-player mode with bots, perfect for newbies or lone wolves, but make sure you've practiced before hopping online, or you'll get destroyed. tl;dr you can't go wrong with this game.
3473	1	a	My kids will play this game until their eyes become raisins... and if they say that Counter Strike 1.6 sucks, they will be grounded until they move out.
2574	0	a	Graphic rly bad
4404	1	a	da grafics r bad but dis game is still good
462	1	a	nice game old school
1957	1	a	Computer doesn't meet requirements, and Valve won't give me refund.
2839	1	a	Good, and old game ;)
3246	1	a	:)
2682	1	a	VAC is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t RIP CS :/
248	1	a	The classic. If you haven't played it yet give it a go (oh the pun) and don't let the lack of ShineyGrafixâ¢ disappoint you. I have both the later Source and currently latest GO versions but still come back to the original version from time to time because it is still fun and its classic style is still completely fine... and a lot of people who still play CS regularly shares my view.
3652	1	a	Haven't played too much of this, but I can see why alot of gamers were hooken on this for years and still occasionally come back to it. Its completely worth it.
2968	1	a	What a fun game. As a single play mania it was a little bit shame to see no bots in Counter Strike but there were still many servers running so you'll have no problem playing it. Since there were no active asian servers because Nexon got hold of asian market with 'Counter Strike Online' I had to play in a Brazilian server which made me go through horrible lag but even with the lag it was still enjoyable. Gear up, You can still enjoy the beginning of Counter Strike series.   +) Easy and straightforward game play. Shoot on sight. +) Optimized Aiming.
1625	1	a	I wish I could give a comprehensive review on this classic shooter, but I'm not allowed to play it anymore.  I have 1.6 hours played.
253	1	a	This is not a drill,I kill with the skill
5028	1	a	One of the best games ever made.
5208	1	a	My game is zoomed many times in, and i can't change it, because its zoomed to long in.... Please Help Me !!! :( 
294	1	a	Better than source, or GO... &lt;3 1.6!!! literally the best game ever. been playing for 12+ years and i love this game!!
1667	1	a	One of the games i've enjoyed, the original is always the best the say but i do recommend to have a look on the newer versions as well, it is a great game serie. I've played the Counter strike games and Half Life for quiet a while and i can't complain, 1+
2591	1	a	I'M A DIRTY â¥â¥â¥â¥IGN CHEATER!
4983	1	a	10/10

1668	1	a	.
2057	1	a	highly recommended to live no life
2348	1	a	Legendary! Counter Strike 1.6 - as it should be.  The game has stood the test of time, an yet still out does Counter Strike Source, as one of the most remembered, well designed, fun multiplayer shooters of the last decade.  9/10
3358	1	a	Best game in the world! :D
2166	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ nuggets. try to shift walk - join new server try to crouch - join new server

1797	1	a	Even if it is an old game, this is AWESOME. :)
1317	1	a	Classic and yet still the one of the most entertaining FPS-style shooters that has ever set foot on earth. Gameplay mechanics are fun and yet challenging. Game provides many different gamemodes from regular deathmatch-bomb plant mission to platformer style of gamemodes. Overall an awesome game and I recommend it to anyone who has any cs experience or has any interest in FPS-shooters :)
2395	0	a	This game was good because it wasnt crashing [for me] like now. Every time i open it up, it shows 'Half-Life Launcher stopped working'. This happen all the time i open it up. Help me fix it.
4783	1	a	Played it?
604	1	a	the 3rfd instalment in the battlefield seires, like call of duty with guns battle against your friends or team up with enemys in this intergalactic space shooter
2545	0	a	This game is overrated.
3156	1	a	Good game. Classic :)
1149	1	a	IS THE BEST
2837	1	a	Cs 1.6 FOREVER!
3298	0	a	Really Great Classic But Every server I go on I get kicked and banned because people kick me because im not good enough for them and that's not fair is it? well oh well some times.We cant just sit down and enjoy the classics.....
4272	1	a	say notthing it just awesome!
1068	1	a	God Games :D
47	1	a	Best FPS game of all time. It's a shame only a few people still play it. Great for older Counter Strike players and newer ones to experience what older players had with this game :) This is where Counter-Strike is love Counter-Strike is life really have a meaning.  After several thousand hours in the game I still love and cherish it. A must have for any FPS player out there.

3587	1	a	âChampions keep playing until they get it right.â  
4311	1	a	This is the classic and the best iteration of cs by some metrics, personally I really liked it I highly recommend if your pc is slightly less powerful.
713	1	a	And thus a legend was born..
3520	1	a	Fire in the hole
671	1	a	worth playing ;)
4024	1	a	Why not buy it? Its classic, it requires low requirements, and more importantly, its FUN! People who are new to this may be frustrated when playing this but eventually when you understand how the game works you will be good at it. Its always good to have games like this that has low requirements, so if you go play on your friends pc or if you just simply want to play this, i can pretty much guarantee that this game should work well and will not WASTE your time. In fact, it'll KILL time if you are bored. Just have to get yourself hooked up into this and you are all good. Just be sure to also find good servers, mostly with alot of people haha! So, give this game a try!
1123	1	a	Really enjoyed this FPS. Was the first game i played on a PC and loved every minute of it. Great for first time and more experianced players. Easy controls and have to say that the game runs very smooth. Will highly recommend it guys moving to the PC world from console as I did.

1600	1	a	Old School is always the best.
4418	1	a	A very good game!
2187	1	a	Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I was just 4 years old .  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. 'Very Addictive Game :p
2007	1	a	Counter strike: Source is better... but I like the cover for this one better.....
4944	1	a	i love this game this game is awesome!
4674	1	a	Old,but awesome game.I play HNS.Hide 'n Seek.I recommend it you can try to buy it.
2373	0	a	NONONONONONONONOONNONOONO  WTF HAPPENS? I buy the game and i just try to play it.  List of servers: '[FREE VIP]' 20/32 users in ALL servers. When i enter the message of the day never gets out when i press 'OK'. Server disconnect and automatic send me to another server. JUST FEW servers works fine, and not so much fine.  CSS Location Folder: God.. i was searching the problem about that âââ and i just found a note block just says.. 'Have a nice huge d*ck up your as*!' and another folder with insult too.  WTF Valve? i gave the game to a friend to check if was just MY error but no. He also get the same '''error''' than me.  Maybe the first things i saw was just an error.. but founding a folder that was insulting me? I dont think so Valve, i can report this '''''error'''' but i didn't.  I buy this game just for enjoy my old times.. So i prefer download it pirate.  PS: I never touch any file or change something. Again, idk how Valve can do this and i don't think was a 'hacker'.

5117	1	a	Was a fun game, until 1.3 came around. It was fun until people stared to camp the bomb sites, before that it was braveheart with guns. When that stopped so did the fun.

433	1	a	I like this classic game! All textures,all weapons....I think this game was the first, and I hope to be still, the best!
2780	1	a	The best 'realism' Half-Life mod as it's the one everyone remembers. Causing incalculable rage in dialup users for years and years. If you're bad you're a nub, if you're good you're a hacker, if you're just mediocre then you're just right.

3138	1	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him: 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately!'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me: 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
2912	1	a	Well, when it comes to an good old fashioned cops n' robbers chase, it doesn't get any better than Counter Strike. Sure some might call the 90's graphics outdated and the weapons unbalanced. That's why some just buy the other games such as GO or source. IF you doesn't have any problem with sweet and smooth nostalgia, then Counter Strike is for you! :D
3962	1	a	i can,t play it. does anybody know how to restore setting
4033	1	a	Counter-Strike it's really amazing, but today really it's bad we can't play good, just before are good. Server are Sh~# PPL are Sh%$ really it's BAD  People Play free, Play Clean, Play to your mode, and OFF HACK, OFF cheating , OFF Scripting, OFF ALL    Play Fun :)
1329	1	a	the best game in the world, a child â¥
3701	1	a	CS is Love CS is Life &lt;3
3337	1	a	Rarely any game nowadays gives you so much control, the game can be perfect extension of your hands, there is barely any limitations in movement as well as in shooting.
1779	1	a	simply the best
3422	0	a	So i bought this game, and didnt work it appears only a black screen.Can anyone help me 
3381	1	a	This is a good game that can run on bad computers.
3884	1	a	Old memories...
3510	1	a	This is an all-time best FPS game!
4304	1	a	:)
2712	1	a	Classick!!!
2151	1	a	Servers are too far fps and are not :'( 
2279	1	a	The best Counter-Strike currently released for competetive value/integrity.  It highly rewards the skilled players, unlike CS:GO and Source.
4091	1	a	great game so fun get it if u love cs and want to see what the first is like
768	1	a	where are the skins?
3053	1	a	classic !
1755	1	a	.
3818	1	a	One of the best fps ever
3893	1	a	All time best game! Must play it
81	1	a	This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but i recommend buying Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and completing the game on hardest difficulty two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of old generation games so I wanted to buy This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but firstly buy Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and complete game on hardest difficul two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of the older games so I wanted to buy it first because i wanted see what it was like before. I played that game, my older brothers played aswell . So when you play this game you have the feeling that you went back in time and played it. Gameplay has been perfect for years. The grapichs are still awsome to me, I play a lot of Black Ops 3 on ps4, this is way better than that for me. So if you have pasion and love to games first play Counter Strike , trust me you will had a lot of fun.  I rate the game10/10.
1721	1	a	This game is not bad but still better than Twilight
2140	1	a	luv thr gmae v bu t hsvaer wrto get hacks hehehehz
891	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
1524	1	a	Still the best fps
242	1	a	The best game !
445	1	a	Most favourite game of my childhood &lt;3
2900	1	a	Great game and what I suggest is getting it on steam because it comes with condition zero and it's better like that because condition zero has a campaign and normal counter-strike is great with multiplayer so get this game
1153	1	a	Normal computer games !!
3791	1	a	This game is the most fun multiplayer game hands down, there is still so much variety that it never gets old.
3696	1	a	  OMG its the best game after CS:GO . MUST BUY !!!     LIE&lt;3
3035	1	a	This was the beginning of an obsession. I love you.
4601	1	a	I recommend to other players its very cool.
1997	1	a	Also recommend this game, this is the type of FPS. There are a lot of servers online, where you can have fun, and feel like a Zombie or jump on deathrun. I would recommend the game 11/10!
2410	0	a	Its a good game but due to how long it has been out people that are just starting have a massive learning curve you would be better off just getting the new version Counter-Strike Global Offensive
3032	1	a	Best game since rocket league, uhm no wait
2853	1	a	.
4699	1	a	Best in the Counter Strike series, have been playing this mostly since 2004. Sadly, there are only fewer players and servers now...
3230	0	a	Nah, this game is fun but glitch as hell serch for a popper game..
1800	1	a	Old is GOLD!!!
138	1	a	best first person shotter of all time   very compatative but i feel like valve not supporting it any more :(
1744	1	a	Nice game!
2698	1	a	Killed myself with a grenade.  moron/10
1635	1	a	Must try ... This game is just awesome *-*  Playing since my childhood ... Still love this game ððð  Love From India ð
2689	1	a	.
828	1	a	Played it a bit. It is nice.
4911	1	a	This is not a game but a religion, a way of life. If you are not upto the competetion better stay away from it.
4653	1	a	:)
3269	1	a	Best game, thanx
4259	1	a	Nice game!
2121	1	a	This game is the best game ever
4531	1	a	This is a classic game. It still to this day has a huge player base. Yet the ones that still play are true die hard CS fans. Most are very skilled and have been playing the game sense day one. Still one of the best CS I have ever played. Before anyone asks I run this game on windows 8 and it works like a charm. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic FPS experience.
3882	1	a	Still has an active community.
121	1	a	Excellent, superb, babelicious game. Ruined my last year of Jr. High and a few of my High school years, would ruin again 10/10.  Excelente juego. Arruino unos aÃ±os de escuela, arruinaria de nuevo 10/10.  PS  I miss my WON ID.
5136	1	a	Great
4577	1	a	:)
335	1	a	is it gud or good? 
1698	1	a	Awesome Game &lt;3
3091	1	a	Best cs i`ve ever played. You need strong aim, hard brain and not the best computer to master this game. Played this between 2002-2009, old graphic but perfect balanced and maps with clearly edges .  Its my favoured shooter between 2000-2010. Buy and play it
1749	1	a	Nice game!
2306	1	a	For those who, put negative reviews, well not for those but for all of them, you write negative review just because game lags, it's only your problem, much of the people has no problems with this game, this game can be ran easily on potato pc, same if you got a VAC ban that's your problem, that's your problem if you're stupid and can't play legitimately, many cheaters in your opinion?? Find another server don't sit on one server, or go to Steam-only server. People play this game only for fun, there are no ranks(not talking about server's specific ranks), that's the most important thing. Of course teamgame on this mostly dissapeared, people play only by theirselves, but that's good, you know why? You will never get nervous if your teammate fails to defuse the bomb or something like that, because you play by yourself. Talking about game modes, oh God there are so much modes, starting from Surf ending with Zombie Plague. You can play this with your friends easily, cause there are no rank restrictions. The ban system and other things like amx_ban or amx_kick are highly fixed and upgraded at maximum. You can put whatever skins you want from CS:GO and so on, and use it without any restrictions. This old - school game is being massively played for 16 years now and i think that after 10 years he's going to be played still.  Highly recommended!
618	1	a	The mother of all online FPS shooters.

1834	1	a	this game fun when i stuck in russian internet cafe in forest but now i live in glorious european i can play csgo!!!!  ( only poor chinese and russia play this, sometimes a german))
3616	1	a	Great game, it was originally a mod for half-life 1 but valve picked it up and what a great choice that was, it has now become one of the most successful PC series to date with CS:GO being one of the most played PC games ever
1521	1	a	  Legendary team shooter of all time!  
3038	1	a	This game is the best FPS Classic Game i've ever played, If you still don't have it you're not alive :D
92	1	a	Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of 'shooter', which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.  And here is my thoughs..  This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007. I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER and more and more and more... It's just fantastic! :D  10/10 Would recommand it!
812	1	a	Great Game Smooth moves every fun Deagle op +Good Game 
1736	1	a	Buy CS:GO instead
2856	1	a	...
2893	1	a	Doesn't need no intro.. I mean come on, this is CS1.6. The godfather of all competetive tactical shooters! Best FPS to date. _O_
271	1	a	Very Good Game &lt;3
11	1	a	Blame this game for the rise of the online multiplayer modern military shooter. Good game, great custom maps, terrible community. Not much has really changed since 2000, has it?  I don't think anyone still plays this particular version of CS though.  Edit: Wait, there are over 8,000 people in-game right now. Wow... guess I have to give this a 'yes' then because it isn't dead.
1673	1	a	Cheaters!
1826	1	a	The best shooting game ever.
654	1	a	Still one of the best multiplayer games to ever be made. This is still my favourite CS

1661	1	a	Love this game to be honest, great game which has its ups and downs, base of my PC gaming career, best game franchise based off of Half-Life what can i say.
5115	1	a	The fundamentals of Counter Strike can be viewed here through her origins. It is recommended for nostalgia, not immersive gameplay or graphics. A toaster can run counter strike.

4196	1	a	the best game in EU

2720	1	a	My first love when I was 8 :D
1859	1	a	Counter-Strike has changed a lot from 2000 to (present-day) 2015. Even with the release of CS:GO, Counter-Strike 1.6 still remains a favorite for me. There are still many dedicated servers with ten or more people in them. The graphics are outdated of course, especially in maps like nuke, but they still look decent on a few maps . This game is the beggining of one of the game series out there. I would give this game 8/10 and would reccomend this to any retro-style gamer! ;)
93	1	a	This game an immortal :D
1841	1	a	Still playable
322	1	a	Old but gold.
4211	1	a	Actually retired
5146	1	a	I don't even have this game, but it's fun to watch.  11/10 - would recommend again.
2914	1	a	No Classes, Bad Level design, no fish AI. It's horrible.  11/10, srsly buy it, its better than Call of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Money Stealing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s Modern Season Pass.  It's the father of todays fps(grandfather being the quake and doom games) and it's still fun.

582	1	a	Started at the very beginning to play counter strike at 1.3 and since then it was my favorite online FPS game. Played it very long and have to say since than it was and still is perfect. Sad but its old, and lost its support. Still coming back to remember everything. But now spending time on CS:GO.. If you have an older machine i recommend it to play, cause there are still many servers, and game mods active!
286	1	a	Largely composed of Hispanics, play this game a couple hours a day and you'll learn more about spanish here then any class.
3850	1	a	It Might be a good game for players iwth good internet conection my 5mb isnt enough laggy bad spread and recoil

4151	1	a	Love this game....
2538	0	a	Classic game. Very innovative at its time and it's fun to play. You should get its second remake Counter-Strike: Global Offensive though which is improved in almost every aspect of the game. Only get this if you're a nostalgic freak :-)
3557	1	a	+1

1033	1	a	it's my life xD 
1310	1	a	its like csgo but it isnt â¥â¥â¥ and you can get away with micspam and wallhacks and all kinds of goofy mods without valve forcing you to use viewmodels so you can see their fancy skins
2052	1	a	Im still doing my config.
2335	0	a	physics? not here.
100	1	a	If you can't get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this is great replacement for it. It's not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you can't understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the game's graphics...aren't really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics don't really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10
902	1	a	Totally awesome game , for years been playing this
1220	1	a	Its old but great game for multiplayers......
4142	1	a	This game is really good ;)

4036	1	a	Why should I even recommend this game to anyone new to this if they get their asses kicked by the real Counter-Strike professionals who have been playing this little bad boy since it was released. I think they're the only ones who actually play this game anymore. It's not even played in many e-Sports tournaments anymore since there are newer games out there (sad tho').

4625	1	a	CLASSIC AND A MUST HAVE GAME!!! I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys killing games! It a rather simple game with simple onjectives either to deactivate the bomb, kill the other players, or rescue hostages. In my opinion its worth every dollar! :D
1958	1	a	This game is very nice.
2632	1	a	The lord of counter strikes
4499	1	a	best game evaaahh! buut, CS:GO can be the same enjoyable and fun! :D
675	1	a	Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strikeâs wretched â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to become the man I am today. And, now, Iâm tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didnât go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.  Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided itâs time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class.

1529	1	a	Old but GOLD
2679	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,

2510	0	a	It was better before 2010 when there were not so many hackers. Now is full of hackers... in CS:GO are like 30%-50% of hackers but in cs 1.6 there are over 60% hackers. Poor game now.

4841	1	a	Who likes getting rekt at video games?  This is the game for you :D
3759	1	a	old school
4535	1	a	Old school Counter-Strike, it's just the best.
4943	1	a	tis is real classic
3743	1	a	Just the best multiplayer game of all time that has affected the world like a nuclear bomb. The â1 pretender on 'Test On Time' Award.
3400	1	a	great game
4985	1	a	People only still play this because they have bad computers are just jealous and claim 1.6 is better than source. But on the topic, this game is what started it all. If it was never created, there wouldn't be Counter-Strike:Source.
1588	1	a	BEST shooter of my childhood  ( Junior High School )
1338	1	a	A GREAT!!!! First Person Shooter that requires skill and not spray and pray :D , I suggest anyone to buy this game
4470	1	a	nothing can beat Cs
2419	0	a	the scran is larg i cant play and enter the game to
4002	1	a	try an see!!
2663	1	a	Cool :)
5093	1	a	Way better than global offensive, no over priced skins, no kids teamkilling you for no reason, no ranked\esport (so less Toxicity than GO). too bad it's abandonated,like source.
955	1	a	The best for shooter lovers :)
2890	1	a	True good memories , couldnt forget it ~
5108	1	a	!
1474	1	a	  I like this game =)
1990	1	a	Man this game is my favorite since this really is a classic and it really doesnt need a beefy computer to play and theres still people playing it today!
4358	1	a	This game is one of the best games i have ever played!!!!
1178	1	a	Why not
3365	1	a	It's old but timeless. I don't like this game as much as team fortress but it's no doubt a great game. If you like old-school(ish) shooters, than this is for you. Theres still over 20,000 people online too!
213	1	a	Top old times game. So... what are you waiting for? just buy it damm
3600	1	a	The game functions just like half-life with a few twists. Realy good game but CS:GO better. This game still has players today if your intrested in purchasing this game.
1290	1	a	If you like shooting the bad guys then this is one of the games for you. When Counter-Strike was originally released in 2000, I didn't play it because I was like 1 year old. I play it now because of the fast/slow paced actions and the guns. There are a bunch of guns in Counter-Strike that you can use. There are little guns that are cheap, and big guns that are expensive. But here lies the problem with Counter-Strike... people don't even use all of the guns! Whenever I find onto a server, all of the players are only using the black gun, the brown gun, the silver gun, and the green gun. Even though there is a bunch of weapons, they aren't really all used much of the time. In the end, I play Counter-Strike because my computer is afraid of Counter-Strike: Source.
576	1	a	the best game of the world, forever in our heart &lt;3
5038	1	a	A real classic!
662	1	a	still the best counter-strike together with condition zero, good times :)
3842	1	a	Good, I guess.

1045	1	a	Over a decade later and this game is still the most-played game on Steam and for good reason; solid gameplay, controls, user-generated maps and mods; the list goes on.   This FPS personally serves as a model of comparison whenever I play any other first-person games.

1213	1	a	Best CS of all time, fast pace, accurate and even after all these years still fun to play! If you play any CS game I encourage you to get 1.6 so you can experience more of how it began!
4802	1	a

2616	1	a	Not really my type of game. But if you're into online FPS, you may like it.
1563	1	a	It's classic FPS shooter game which I have been playing since it's been released and I still play it. Can't let it go entirely. If you are looking for a game with many different modes available this is a game for you. Example of available mods(servers with special modes are available online) are zombie mod, plague mod, paintball mod, soccer mod, jailbreak mod, gungame mod and many more!

3525	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hard to play with all hackers, but still fun as i remember when i was child... very good =3
2440	0	a	Counter-strike, my childhood! Brings bad memories back...  One of the first Valve games, and this one is a total â¥â¥â¥â¥. I understand why Half-life sucks so much, but how famous multiplayer trash shooter can be so badly made?! There is two teams, terrorist team and counter-terrorist team (both acts like scumbags). Your goal is to kill other team or place the bomb as terrorist. Allahu akbar! Never seen this before, bad guys can actually win. Its terrorism propaganda! Counter-strike playerbase is worst part of this, they dumb as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and hot headed of course, alot of cheaters who cant play fair, this makes this game completely unplayable and innocent people get VAC ban (like me). Valve dont want to take responsibilty, they want to have fun with their â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Steam money and spit on us! There is only one official game mode, kill each other and take score. Pfff, we need more! Like capture the flag, zombies and singleplayer (officially) i dont know what else to say, those freaks done so little about this game.  0/10 Blood-Brain win
2822	1	a	alongside unreal tournament 1999, quake 2/3 and natural selection as the greatest shooters of all time 10/10 i got one clicked through a wall
448	1	a	This is my favorite game .
4440	1	a	Video of me :)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqlapB-cLAk 
1162	1	a	Old memories *-*
2670	1	a	Pure classic - you must buy this game if you're a fan of FPS compared with TeamPlay.
3609	1	a	Great game. IS good
2494	0	a	It was my favorite game, but since steam tried so much to screw this game with all that useless updates that ruied it...and it dosen't work on windows 8, plus they got out D3D the only option that you had if you have windows 8, now...its a piece of crap, if we are talking about cs 1.6 when steam gived a **** about it, then its a 10/10 but now its just a 5/10 or 4/10 RIP cs 1.6 THANKS A LOT STEAM! :(
4764	1	a	the best game ever
191	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥in awesome!
1565	1	a	Still fantastic after all these years. The game that molded a generation.
4853	1	a	Install CS 1.6 now: Go back to the glory days when the game wasn't a trading and gambling arena with a shooting mingame attached!
2483	0	a	This version of CS is obsolete. Your game can get hacked if you join the wrong server. It happened to me. Now when I try to join any server it just sends me to a foreign server with bots.  i reformatted and reinstalled and now i can play. its not an easy thing to fix.
1644	1	a	MINIMUM: 500 mhz processor, 96mb ram, 16mb video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection i dont even have a video card what blasphemy is this 11/10 everyone is better than me
3946	1	a	Look at my hours played. Have you seen it yet? No? Go â¥â¥â¥â¥ing see it right now - it explains everything.
2763	1	a	A simple 3D shooter game. Needs a lot of skill, some strategy and some brain of course.
1158	1	a	Old but gold
4129	1	a	fun fps but there is a high learning curve. Suprisingly fun after 15 years.
515	1	a	its old but gold i still like it &lt;3 long life cs 1.6

651	1	a	No soft,play hard go pro ;)
67	1	a	Counter-Strike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games, coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood back in (1997) when I was only 10 years old and Half-Life, Counter-Strike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.  The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and Counter-Strike litterally had it all in my opinion.  Even today after so many years, I occasionally come back and play Counter-Strike just because it is one of the greatest Counter-Strike versions flat out, anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either Counter-Strike: Source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first then tried Counter-Strike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this, because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.  Counter-Strike is not about the visuals, that is just a bonus, if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game, Counter-Strike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.  If you want quality in a game then Counter-Strike is one of the best games to play and get, hence why I am recommending this game.

4486	1	a	Greatest Game Ever
1795	1	a	The BEST fps of all time and my personal favorite game of all time CS 1.3 was the first game i ever played and 1.6 was even better this is a must buy!
2934	1	a	10/10. It's fun. Play it.
4046	1	a	For OldSchools!

3635	1	a	Simply the best FPS game ever, no matter how good are the graphics nowadays, this one still own them in gameplay + teamplay
1897	1	a	  â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
85	1	a	Buy Condition Zero instead if you want to play with bots. And Global offensive if you want to play multiplayer. But wait, I'm not done yet. Your PC/laptop can't handle CS:GO or CS source but still wants to play Multiplayer? Then this legendary FPS game is the right place to do it.
290	1	a	My entire childhood is laying beneath this amazing game. Always come back to it, no matter what happens.
2285	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played!

1609	1	a	huge classic, everyone should own this
5261	1	a	i just got this brand new game and like it, i wish it had more memes though
23	1	a	Counter-Strike is a great series. Though the real change they made was in CS:GO, Counter-Strike has been one of my favorite FPS games of all time. If you prefer a fast based shooter, this game isn't for you.  Counter-Strike can have exciting moments where it's you VS 5 others, or where you have no defuse kit with only a few seconds left to defuse the bomb  A comparable version of Counter-Strike's defuse gametype is the Call Of Duty 'Search and Destroy'
3342	1	a	I like this game
3677	1	a	  The best fps game in the world.
4779	1	a	I love this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game!
2588	0	a	If u are bored and dont know what to do with your life play this.  Good MP.. Alot of Cheaters.. And can be downloaded for free.  Overall 3/10
3484	1	a	Good Old times. 
359	1	a	:) 
4527	1	a	CS 1.6  It will search for you. It will find you. And someone in the game will probably kill you. If you are noob that is.  10/10 Would kill noobs again.
4670	1	a	So many good memories
3961	1	a	;)
1147	1	a	Been playing this game since 2007 AND I LOVE IT!!!
3369	1	a	:)
3243	1	a	Counter-Strike amazing. Play it.
4798	1	a	Best game of its time, and recent times.
2992	1	a	great game
3925	1	a	A very good game! Maybe it's a bit old but it's still good. If you don't care about the graphics or have a crappy computer and you want to play a really good fps - This game is for you
3904	1	a	Best of the CS series, many a good time spraying people in the dome.
2898	1	a	One of the Best First Person Shooters Ever  the thing that makes this game so awesome is that you will always have competition and theres no excuse for losing or winning because the only thing that can make you good in it is experience there are no in-game purchases and its really hard to get pro or even decent as it doesnt have auto-recovery as many FPS nowdays Highly Recommended
4619	1	a	This was my childhood in a nutshell
206	1	a	10/10
3746	1	a	Putin has officially taken over counter-strike. The world is next

258	1	a	Time to frags. :3
1966	1	a	Highly recommended! LEGEND!
210	1	a	I haven't written a review in a while but I'd like to do one for this game. Before CS:GO came out I played this game every now and then after school but I normally played Source. I started playing this game after I remember the difficulty and skill needed to handle the aiming in this game and honestly after all these years this game is still amazing, if you get the 'These graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥' mindset and focus on the gameplay it's amazing. It's fast-paced and some of the modded maps are insanely detailed. Amazing game with amazing replay value.
1626	1	a	latinos ruined it
1844	1	a	+1
3488	1	a	Old games the best :D
2639	1	a	Cool
4859	1	a	HUGE is the difference between this and GO. Hitbox is better than cs:go (altought still bad), admins can ban/kick hackers, raging russian level is lower.
2496	0	a	This game is old for now we have the 'Counter Strike - Global Offensive' it's really better and very nice game   the CS1.6 is really old sucks texture but old times it was great.
1179	1	a	Easy to learn , but hard to master.
1978	1	a	A good game that will probably never die out
1771	1	a	best fps-shooter ever ^^
487	1	a	THIS IS MADNESS!
1689	1	a	The best game ever!!!

1806	1	a	top
4168	1	a	what's wrong with counter strike ? if i want to play it's says 'couldn't load library'
609	1	a	One of the best first person shooters.
693	1	a	pure white cocaine of fps games
2737	1	a	;)
1121	1	a	One of the Best FPS games ever made.
1136	1	a	Can play hours on the game. There are better alternatives but for low graphics this is a good game :D :P
1984	1	a	+rep me please
4523	1	a	It's just Counter-Strike, i don't know what to say...
91	1	a	1.6 is love, 1.6 is life
1108	1	a	.
4754	1	a	Best game ever, all the mods make the game worth buying and playing even in 2015!
2586	0	a	The others always kill you and your team mates only just fooling around and show to everyone how many mocking word they know.    I cannot recommend this game no-one.
2358	1	a	I dont own this one either.
2220	1	a	The best for all!!!!!!!
3806	1	a	Best FPS game i've ever played since 2003!
4984	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥'s mad whack awesome
3895	1	a	:)
2033	1	a	Still the best game out there
1714	1	a	Best shooter ever created...RIP
4203	1	a	This is Great Game   Let's play Togeter
5119	1	a	.
4269	1	a	There's nothing about Counter-Strike 1.6 that hasn't be said already, the game will always remain flawless in many gamers eyes throughout the world. Tactiacl shooter at its finest, Cs 1.6 offers not only perfectly balanced matches and good maps but intense sneaking, real quick scoping, amazing weaponry, strategies and SO much more! It is the easiest game to just pick up and play, and it would totaly fit in 'Things any human beings should try atleast once.' list.
3773	1	a	10/10 one of the best experiences and probably my most played game ever. Childhood memories &lt;3
1838	1	a	played this for like 7 years before steam was even created. great game.
3727	1	a	This is a great game this or csgo should win the award!
2908	1	a	preety much the best game of all time
5196	1	a	Nice Game 
1327	1	a	It's a 2000 game style but it steel like old school games. Low quality,low pixels that's the reason why this game is so popular.
1447	1	a	Old is gold!
3781	1	a	THE MOST CLASS GAME EVER!!!!! &lt;3
2786	1	a	Rating: 10/10  The game which basically brought me to the world of gaming. From 1.05 to 1.6 I have spent enormous number of hours playing this game and even it's now getting old and pushed out by CS:GO, I still have nostalgy. Best non-story FPS at that time and still better than many modern FPS movie-based games.
197	1	a	i can't stop playing :D
1010	1	a	One of the best games, not to even mention first person shooter games, of all time. After 16 years or so since it's release it's still got an avid active following. Speaks volumes for it's addictiveness and replayability.
3546	1	a	This is a multiplayer game that takes some time to learn to play it! It takes a lot of skill and you can play it with your friends. The price is very cheap for this kinda game
95	1	a	Thanks for a great childhood
3763	1	a	Legendary.
1917	1	a	old but â¥â¥â¥â¥
1258	1	a	It's ok.
2648	1	a	Best childhood game. I wish they would bring back the silly maps like Nipper made.
4069	1	a	:) 
269	1	a	
4797	1	a	My very first game on Steam, great game however I do not recommend it anymore as most servers has viruses which redirects you to a russian server and NOBODY WANTS THAT!! &gt;:(  But it's a great game and will always be one. â¥
5181	1	a	Counter Strike (1.6) is a funny fighting game with bad graphics.  i recommend buy this game  :)
3999	1	a	The one
4451	1	a	Much Goodness. As of sould any Valve game be. Simple easy to pick up and play but very hard to master. This game and its other similar sequel Condition Zero have both many mods ranging from football right down to the godly great Fureion Mod.
2266	1	a	The Legend!
1346	1	a	;)
3794	1	a	Love it! Legit! Recommended!!!
3499	1	a	A must have ! Classic
409	1	a	Awesome game! Never had so much fun with any other game!
2847	1	a	A classic that everyone needs to have played at least once.
3758	1	a	  CS 1.3 &gt; CS 1.6 &gt; CS:GO &gt; CS:S.  I recieved this product for free because it was still just a mod of half-life when steam started out.
616	1	a	Still The Best Of All Counter-Strike
243	1	a	Great!
2702	1	a	Awesome Addictive game :D
1416	1	a	Best multyplayer shooter
4607	1	a	1337
2280	1	a	Old but gold and the start of the FPS genre back in my childhood
916	1	a	play this game
2614	1	a	
411	1	a	Get in position and wait for my go !
2405	0	a	This game was ok, and fun. Then it just stopped work. It loads a black screan with a white box, and just hangs.   I would not but this game.
2443	0	a	I really would like to recommend this game, it's amazing, but this game is infected with hackers. The Valve Anti-Cheat in this game has gone wrong, it would never ban a cheater but bans innocent gamers. A friend of mine got banned from this game, five years ago, and he still can't play, even the prisoners IRL have second chances, but not in a game? Really Gabe Newell?
2504	0	a	This game doesn't have 7 day bans. 0/10
2868	1	a	I love this game!
216	1	a	Mother of First-Person-Shooter games! This 14 years old game is still in the top 10 most played games, was and will always be the world's number 1 online action game. Once you play this game, you will never get bored of it, even if you were unskilled in classic mods, there will always be a good and funny mod that will suits you. Still haven't bought this game? Go get it! Fully recommended - 10/10!
3695	1	a	âââââ 5/5 Nice game! Nice quality! My favorite game! The best of the best online shuter 2000 - 2004. / Ð¥Ð¾ÑÐ¾ÑÐ°Ñ Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ°! Ð¥Ð¾ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÐ³Ð¾ ÐºÐ°ÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð°! ÐÐ¾Ñ Ð»ÑÐ±Ð¸Ð¼Ð°Ñ Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ°! ÐÑÑÑÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¸Ð· Ð»ÑÑÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¾Ð½Ð»Ð°Ð¹Ð½ ÑÑÑÐµÑ 2000 - 2004.
2038	1	a	Old game but still one of the best :)
1883	1	a	This came out 14 years ago, and it still has better graphics than your average Call of Duty game.
3865	1	a	The game of my life:)
3252	1	a	The best (CS) game of all time obviously. No talk. No questions.
3782	1	a	i started counter strike much later than my peers, hell, i think i started playing it after csgo existed  would still prefer playing this over csgo  10/10 would fire in the hole again
2413	0	a	not as fun anymore since there are more empty than full servers and little to no communication
1359	1	a	My name is Bob.
4074	1	a	Fun game , but outdated !

3839	1	a	Great game! Still playing!!! :)   You all know! :)
4753	1	a	old school game ....it was a pleasure to play it thanks valve
3725	1	a	Best game in the world, proving all these years I still consider to be the best and most played game in the world
3614	1	a	Great graphics... â¤
1193	1	a	.
5155	1	a	Truely a classic, I'd play this game over Global Offensive any day.
2388	0	a	game of year!  date: 03/05/2016 (russia)
1122	1	a	Since I grew up with Counter-Strike: Source, I can't give a full review on how I feel about this game. But concerning that I am very into the Counter-Strike series I'd have to say this would be a legendary game for me if it was in my time.
2946	1	a	probably the first game on my account ever (well the whole goldsrc pack but ya know)
1639	1	a	nice game for low graphic
3657	1	a	Trumps president.... Well you know how they say, Only a 100 nukes needed and you can cause a nuclear winter causing mass famin, have fun sleeping this week
1225	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 10/10
2806	1	a	15 years on and this is still the best First Person Shooter (FPS) Game in the history of Gaming which formed the base for all the new FPS games developed so far!
3096	1	a	:)
22	1	a	I tried it a few times.
3362	1	a	The only game that lets you have a 5 kill streak and a defuse with 300+ ping
1540	1	a	Have a PC that you bought in the 1990s? Want the discount global offensive experience without the crate opening bullsh*t? Do you want to play a true first person shooter? Are you looking to impress your crush with shooting skills although you don't have any? Do you want to appear like a whiny edgy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in front of your parents while giving your friends lessons on when to rush A or B?  This is the game you play.

1128	1	a	The first Counter Strike in the franchise and the community is still there and there are plenty of people who still play it and they are not toxic at all.
