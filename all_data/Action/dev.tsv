4912	1	a	awesome game,i use to play cz before but now i realized cs 1.6 is by far the best game i ever played
1341	1	a	The classic which is Counter-Strike.  A game that has been a platform for many competitive FPS games. Also a platform to E-Sports becoming prevalent in popular culture.   Buy this game and reminisce of what CS once was.   It is perfect and it works every time.
3273	1	a	:)
4145	1	a	Steam has been born on this game, few years later still one of the best FPS game n ofc graphic doesnt matter in this case.
1419	1	a	its an awesome game ever
3069	1	a	Love it but it's time to move on to CS:GO. You will be always in my heart! &lt;3
4975	1	a	Still one of the better FPS-games!
449	1	a	This is real good game!!!!!!
5150	1	a	this is a very good game and is worth more that the price it is frecuantly at updating it would reck the expeirience completly
1766	1	a	Old but gold.
3266	1	a	NICE GAME ITS BEEN ALOT OF YEARS SINCE I PLAY THIS GAME NEVER GETS OLD :D !!!
3923	1	a	That's game that will never die
4071	1	a	Best online Shooter ive played also because you can mod it for fun. This game takes more skill than a multitude of other games and for anyone to ever miss out on this game is doing a complete disservice to onesself note to get the original onscreen multiplayer skins set the game models to not be HD in the video options menu
4870	1	a	Theres nothing like some good old cs 1,6 &lt;3
4371	1	a	The best oldschool tactic Shooter :P
329	1	a	.
943	1	a	Most wonderfull gameplay of all the multiplayer games .
593	1	a	This is a great game! I'd check out Source now, Im headed over to check out GO right now and see how it compares CS:S is legendary though, so its going to be tough to beat!
3589	1	a	::))
508	1	a	Good luck getting a kill if you're a beginner. 10/10
2696	1	a	To Jest Gra â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ;D
282	1	a	One of the oldest Counter-Strike games that is the best around.
4361	1	a	Time proven classic that will always be most fun us born in 80' last century !!!
3537	1	a	most fun you can have in online it has jailbreak zombie and many cool other serers
1843	1	a	1.6 was a revolutionary shooter inspired by some of the greats like Team Fortress Classic. There's a reason why Counter Strike is practically a house-hold name now, and why it's one of the most popular multiplayer games. Because it's a powerhouse of effective design and balance.
4456	1	a	A game, every gamer plays and should play.
2580	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
3643	1	a	A real classic from the 90s, this game is still MUCH better than newer titles, like Call of Duty and Battlefield.

3403	0	a	cant even play it because screen for some reson is super sized and i cant adjust it because you cant get into the opitions 
4641	1	a	Where it all started
181	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.
3446	1	a	This is the 'Rosemary's Baby' of video games, a video-offspring of demonic potential...the best multi-player game of 2000, bar none.  A heart-pounding, visceral experience that gets under your skin. The 'just one more round' addiction factor is very high. When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a well-oiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing.
4664	1	a	CEL MAI TARE JOC!!!
4865	1	a	CS
2716	1	a	Since ~ 2003
3857	1	a	Really good game
4589	1	a	..
2227	1	a	CS1.6
1047	1	a	Counter-Strike...  This game is the reason to why I got a Steam account in the first place. I got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. Everytime I was at his place we used to play this together in turns; he played for a while, maybe 2-3 deaths then I played. We had such a great time. But... the problem was that outside his house we couldn't play the game together.   At the time my dad didn't allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. Since that day we played it all the time. One of our favorite servers was Eropid (HS Only). He (my friend) ended up beeing in 4-5 place for a while on the server.   Overall, I've had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. The game was the start to my FPS gaming interest and since then I've bought every CS released.  I recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play FPS games; as it is a great starting game. I also recommend that you play it with your friends; that way you will get the most fun out of it!   Thanks for reading, and enjoy!   - nitÃ©  
288	1	a	Here's my story, I went over to my friend's house one day, he was playing CS. I tried it for myself, I was instantly hooked and have been for over 10 years with the counter strike franchise. Best online action franchise ever for the pc in my opinion. Counter strike is like a drug that you will never be cured from, trust me.

1251	1	a	World BEST FPS GAME EVER MADE
3740	1	a	:)
2651	1	a	its a good game over all 
1987	1	a	Best online multiplayer competitive game ever made. A game with such masterful dynamics where both brilliant individual skill and team strategic ingenuity play equally important role in the final goal of triumph. Perfect in all aspects. Definitely won't get a decent successor in near future.
3348	1	a	Childhood classic. I love the game.
3676	1	a	Its is an amazing game really enjoyable! it is also fun playing this with friends! 10/10 RECCOMEND
2923	1	a	Epic-super-awsome box game thing
2594	1	a	great game
3250	1	a	Best game in the genre!
4749	1	a	This is my favourite game and also from my point of view the moust interesting shooter game ever made. Is best to play it with friends or with other people to test your skills.
10	1	a	Playing it since 2010. Still bad at it.   10/10 Best game in CS series.
1270	1	a	Love The Game. The Server is not dead yet,yesterday I just played 1-2 hours. 10/10 R.I.P. CS Classic.
4746	1	a	i love this game
1820	1	a	Unlike CS:GO, with getting expensive knives and later after you finally figure out how to use it you get shot by a noob. This game offer's true Russian Language Speaking Lessons, I have now learned fluent Russian and somehow learned German along the way. It works like a true Russian Language Speaking (and German) simulator should,   8/8 m8.
3938	1	a	.
4360	1	a	Either everyone uses Aimbots or I really suck. Probably the second one.
4150	1	a	SUPER COOL GAME
3863	1	a	what can i say
1191	1	a	iS-Cs
4731	1	a	OldSchool ! ! ! Yeah
3778	1	a	Well Old is Still a Gold
2655	1	a	Finally switching to play CSGO, loved you.
4449	1	a	This is an old-school game.
3454	1	a	Well, yes I do recommend Counter-Strike for the fun that comes with it at first.
1753	1	a	My first contact with this was long time ago.... so fun !!!!!
4433	1	a	PlayHardGoPro
2133	1	a	the classic. the feels.
5257	1	a	Remains an old classic. The mechanics of the movement in this game is simply art. The way that you can gain boost by using a simple technique called 'bhoppin' aka 'bunnyhopping' is just overwhelming amazing. The graphics brings you straight back to the childhood, sitting there jumping around with your Desert-Eagle and AK-47. As said, an old classic, a must have game.
4876	1	a	Old the best game ever :)
525	1	a	:)
2880	1	a	Best game ever made... Domination of movemenet, shooting mechanics - recoil... Exaclty what a FPS game need... When developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good FPS, they will make a game as good as CS 1.6 is... CS:GO does not have these major aspects, and doesn't deserve name of Counter-Strike (IMO). As a third very important thing for FPS game, I would say the animations... The animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc... Graphics isn't so important, doesn't need to be sooo good, but decent due to visibility...
1687	1	a	Still better than csgo
1584	1	a	it's older than the people who play cs go.
3976	1	a	Awesome, old-school, easy!
1364	1	a	Best game, my first fps game :D
4658	1	a	Addictive
3119	1	a	Best game in the history!  1.6 Never die!
2633	1	a	Good Game its worth it
2699	1	a	One of the best (all-time) multiplayer competitive games.
219	1	a	buy counter-strike 1,6
4047	1	a	Play this game
4208	1	a	Great
1759	1	a	.
1082	1	a	I love this game!
114	1	a	Great Game :))
2498	0	a	Terrible game. 1/10 WOULD NOT PLAY.
2654	1	a	still the best game ever!
2164	1	a	Geforce is still supporting this game
1900	1	a	Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.  Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.  What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.  Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.  As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.  The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.  It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.  If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.  There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.  At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.  When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as 'same old' to us.  This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.  And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.
2065	1	a	All the memories
1159	1	a	One of the best 1st Player game.
2126	1	a	CS 1.6 FOREVER
2043	1	a	Finds new friends and learns something
3649	1	a	Although the game is more than 16 years old, it is still a very nice game and many people play it.I strongly recommend buying it.
5069	1	a	After all this time? Always..
4232	1	a	CS
1392	1	a	 It all started here.   I could also say ' I born here '.  What can I say, just the best game I've ever played!
4088	1	a	Cs Go time
3684	1	a	One of the most played FPS games ever made, with thriving scenes surrounding pretty much all of its versions. Worth checking out for its competitive scene alone, this game set the bar for all tactical shooters to come.
4682	1	a	.
3651	1	a	very fun game! have so much memories from this game and will never forget &lt;3
2581	0	a	With this new CS 1.6 you can't play.Lag as f*ck.Got an awesome PC but this CS don't mind that,just keep lagging. My internet con. its great too but this CS ain't giving sh*t.Just keep on lagging!
4919	1	a	Counter-Strike is one of the most nostalgiac experiences i've had. With that being said I enjoyed the steam version for my 24 hours playing it. However there is a great bit of lag on most servers in this game although I shouldn't have any. Putting that aside however Counter-Strike is still one of the most revolutionary games for its time. The multiplayer may be dying down and I have yet to convert to go which I dont know if I will. If you got this with Half Life you remember getting this with it. This is still the same fun game from that period that has come to be a cult classic. It plays very well and is fun to play with friends. Although I may find Team Fortress 2 more enjoyable from my short time playing that game, I shall still enjoy Counter-Strike for what it was.
934	1	a	If you liked one point six of Counter-Strike you might have enjoyed Coldplay.  Also, you're a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hipster who needs to get off the Gameboy and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play a game that isn't older then my mother.  BBQhtc - My mother is a saint...
3731	1	a	Great game. Still alive and kicking :D
2704	1	a	Don't let this Game Down ^_^
3448	1	a	The best of the best 10/10 :)
1335	1	a	Life is 1 but, Counter Strike is 1.6
2005	1	a	:3
792	1	a	this game is juste, simply, clearly perfect, no game could ever get any close to it, i have CS:GO and yet i enjoy a lot more cs 1.6 then CS:GO  good points: - a classic but amazing gameplay suited for thousands and thousands of fun playing - a load of modifications and moded servers with a multitude of skins for best looking game possible (like Zm mod,ZE or BaseBuilder....) - low requirements for it, but yet it allows to play with soooo many people on internet on many servers, as anybody could run this game - very amazing low download size making it pretty much portable (400~Mb of download is still much less then other games) - and ofc, the nice spent hours with friends killing each others as well as working together (RIP to old friendships broken by this game too :P) - diversity of communities to enjoy a sociable envirement and getting new friends Bad points: - graphisme are not good for those who are getting used to nowadays games (some people might overcome this point by simply loving the simplicity of the game) - presence of annoying cheaters on servers and the small management of such problems - no single player mode and even if you fight bots, its not fun.  i think thats all for my review, i've been playing this game for like 4 years now and i still freaking enjoy it and i really recommand it to anyone with powerfull and low pc, it creates unbreakable friendship relations :v
1175	1	a	the best game &lt;3
575	1	a	its isnt enought that i am paying since when i was 3 yer old :D ? this game is my Love &lt;3
780	1	a	1
53	1	a	I don't like because Steam blocked redirections from server to server. I know that people using it to slowhack, but now... servers with redirection are unusefull..  Also, VAC not working good for Counter-Strike 1.6. Maybe it could be good for some update, or something...   I can give you anything you need for it.  Contact me.  Kinds and Regards, drag1c.
279	1	a	Best online shooter ever!
753	1	a	Csgo with guns 9.5/10
4498	1	a	Old game but still good for weak computers
3040	1	a	the best
111	1	a	The greatest game ever made, with Half Life in second. The father to competitive shooters. I'm happy to be back playing it
4757	1	a	I know what you're thinking. 'Did he fire all 7 shots or only 6?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this a .50 Desert Eagle, the most powerful handgun in the game, and it is a one-shot kill with a headshot, you've got to ask yourself one question. 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk?
1764	1	a	It's... aight.
2359	0	a	incredibly hard to get a vac ban
3604	1	a	I don't think this one needs a review... Childhood memories...
1745	1	a	the best fun game ever that everybody will remember
1005	1	a	This game should be a legend :)
3558	1	a	I love this game so much
2259	1	a	sweet game, i only play oe x box, pc way better, recommened by me 
1373	1	a	....
562	1	a	Best.FPS.Ever. You may have noticed I have very little hours, that is because, as a young duck, I used to play this game 24/7 at cybercafes vs randoms who played it, basically a LAN there, brings tears to my eyes the experiences I shared with this game and the people at that 1 cybercafe :_(.
3871	1	a	the best
1506	1	a	10/10 Best Game With Good Graphics but need to update
1272	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6? Classy. Play it.
4038	1	a	Love palying this game.
2825	1	a	:)
3985	1	a	Hands down the best multiplayer FPS ever. Even 12 years after its official 1.0 release, its still the most played action game online. While other big online multiplayer FPS's have come on gone with a lot of fanfair(i.e. Battlefield 1942, COD 2, Battlefield 2, UT 2004, Counter-Strike:Source, Quake Live, COD 4, etc etc etc) this game has remained a constant favorite in E-Sports and amonst FPS fans. Lets hope CS:GO can continue the CS tradition of teamplay, great maps, competitivness, and unmatched gunplay. LONG LIVE CS!
2143	1	a	awesome just awesome released in 2000 good since 2000 :D graphics dont matter!
5013	1	a	This was the beggining of the Couter-Strike game.This was the most fun game i played for a few years , im glad that they keep making new games.The only thing i can say is keep up the good work!!
4261	1	a	This game started the FPS franchise. Well technically it didn't, but it started it for me dammit.
3722	1	a	I like this game cuz i can shot throug walls
3524	1	a	Great game alot of fun nice gameplay   
892	1	a	This is the one of the best game ever i am playing from 2000.
4717	1	a	A really nice game :D
712	1	a	Best â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game ever made, nothing like that dogshit game League of Legends. 1.6 has everything, multiplayer, great community and actually good balancing, League can't get any of that â¥â¥â¥â¥ so it's left outside with the other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games like â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Starcraft and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Halo.

1322	1	a	Counter-Strike is only available to play in multiplayer; no bots. So you're forced to connect to someone else's server and put up with randomness and repetitive maps. And of course, it's the GoldSource Engine and all that entails.  Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is considerably more fun, in my opinion. You get all the same weapons, but there's a pseudo-story mode, AI bots to play with, and different objectives and a variety of maps you hop around, all of them challenging you in new ways. Kind of like the current campaign contracts in Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2.  Get this game (package), especially if it's on sale. If not for the classic-ness (or nostalgia), then get it for the great single-player experience with Condition Zero.
4020	1	a	I strongly recommend this game. Awesome graphics, cool modes at very cheap price $ . And one of the best multiplayer game i've ever played
5070	1	a	*kggghh* Fire in the hole!! *kggghh*

2551	0	a	Very boring, played it a few times, and never played it again. Waste of money.
1455	1	a	Origin of CS &lt;3
4464	1	a	An abslutly amazeing millitary team based tatical shooter. This is a great game for LAN parties and team vs team games. Also very fun to just play yourself online. 9.3/10
1464	1	a	Bought this game (CS anthology bundle) back in 06 from a gaming store in Lamington road and it has been fun playing this every now and then whenever there are good public servers for this game. This game introduced me to STEAM platform as it was a very popular mod of Half-Life. It has been worth every penny to buy this game and I still play it more than I play CSGO.  I get reasonable pings (&lt;50) and I am on MTNL in Mumbai.  If you are newbie lookin to buy I'd recommend you buy the Valve's complete pack during a major sale.
3313	1	a	the best fps game i've ever palyed  don't play cs oO ? what are you waiting for !!!? it's a legend.
2547	0	a	i dont really like this because it can give you the WUMBAAA virus it is a bit of a classic though
1649	1	a	It's ok, i guess. 10/10
2566	0	a	This was one of the best first person shooter and fps games. After steam updated the fpsengine and made other changes to the game after more than 10 years of good gameplay, I would rather say that this is a now a rip-off. The game doesn't work properly and the developers isn't listening to the players when they're updating the game.   If steam would roll back the game to before they update I would recommend this game because of the good gameplay. At the moment because of the update I just want my money back!
4782	1	a	Is ok, But Source &amp; GO are way better obv &lt;3
1552	1	a	this is a goood game and he is my favorite game
5200	1	a	It's a game that i think will go down in history as one of the best FPS games out there..So if you haven't already..If you've been living under a rock or sometihng among those lines...Buy it and try it out..I bet you'll have fun! :D
5050	1	a	123
1653	1	a	The best game in the world ^_^
1534	1	a	Old, but still a great classic. If you like classic FPS games, recommended.
165	1	a	Played this game for the first time in 2008. Since then I have clocked more than 5000 hours, that's how addictive its multiplayer is. Father of all FPS in MP. Plus has several mods deathmatch, hns, kz, gungame, scrim, zombiemod and paintball. It's been 14 years and the game is still going strong atleast in the Indian scene.

1223	1	a	Hello,i have been playing this game for almost 8 years now,and as it seems,the game started to be less popular due to cheaters and hackers! I would recommend everybody to purchase this game and try it out,there is a lot of servers that use WH/AIM Blocks and are not able to cheat on the servers. Valve is banning more and more people with Valve Anti Cheat so yeah,keep up the good work Valve!

4352	1	a	If you need to be told what this game is, I'd prefer it if you weren't on my team in any FPS, ever.
5194	1	a	It's a classic.
3327	1	a	Counter-Strike is an old and challenging game that requires skill and is incredibly addicting.
2433	0	a	When u buy it u are happy. when u have play counter strike in a 1h u will â¥â¥â¥ kill u self
1612	1	a	The oldest game I have, and its great. I played a bit of it recently, and the maps have certainly changed (since I went looking for maps om used to in CS:GO, which are Inferno and Dust II). So I do recommend this game, but if you want better, get either CS:GO, OR the CS Complete Pack.
1064	1	a	I miss Pokemod season 1 &amp; 2.
4338	1	a	awesome game love it best in the whole world
2809	1	a	It's Counter Strike.
3599	1	a	It's just awesome :D
2725	1	a	I've spent so many hours playing this game, meeting new people.  I you've never played this game... what's wrong with you?
1389	1	a	Classic. Loved it when it came out and I still play it sometimes.
3054	1	a	It's a good game and i really like it, but the trouble is: The players who have Counter-Strike 1.6 cracked, 70% has hacks. Please Valve, resolve all hackers. Thank you for reading my review Valve. Oh, wait. I wanted to say something. THIS GAME NEVER GETS OLD &lt;3 :*

2492	0	a	Is old
1141	1	a	Been playing this game since it came out and I love it. I wanna take some time to thank the original developer for this exiting game.

4938	1	a	I love this game!
1603	1	a	Long live cs 1.6
1514	1	a	i dont know any game better than this...
664	1	a	The first and always the best fps game
3364	1	a	This game is a legend in Poland
5164	1	a	remember of the past ^_^
4031	1	a	When you left click, you shoot. 5 stars
370	1	a	This game changed gaming as a whole. One of the best FPS of all time, if not the best. But its all about the gameplay. Its how CS plays that will get you. Huge online community, thousands of mods, nostalgic graphics, excellent gameplay, nice sound effects even if they r outdated. CS 1.6 is my favorite FPS and is much better than Global Offensive in all aspects. I played this game so much before i got Steam, this game is just spetacular. Even in non-steam gaming, lan houses,competitive play, CS 1.6 is still incredibly popular. 10/10, congratulations to the developers.
3920	1	a	Oh God I love this game :D
3814	1	a	Mostly doing this for getting fake internet points.  But seriously, the 'jump' aka 'kz' mod is the main reason I play this game even today.
4156	1	a	Addicted &lt;3
4049	1	a	An amazing classic! It excels from killing zombies with a violin to flying around a knife map using a Pidgeot!
3272	1	a	After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can't be ignored. No other shooter is as accessible, easy to play, simple nor skillful as this. It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties. It's all about aim, accuracy, quick reflexes but does have a strategical element since it is a tactical shooter and there's no respawning. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular.
1750	1	a	Get this game if you love repeatedly hearing sounds of 'Fire in the hole!', not respawning after you die and having to deal with players hundreds of times better than you when you first begin playing. If you enjoy a game of frustration with a terrible community who will look down on you for not having reflexes like a cyborg, this is the right game for you. Also, if you don't already have this game, you are a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Please either buy it or leave Steam immediately.
4539	1	a	123
4595	1	a	It's a good game :D

4146	1	a	ok im not amazing at this game but it the best out of all of them. i think it takes A LOT pratice to get decent lol well to me im not great but if you got a couple of friends, hey might as well play this game
4480	1	a	Best fps of all time, was in 1999 and still is in 2011
4229	1	a	Its an old game but really enjoyable i reccomend this really
2381	0	a	- Bad recoil controll - Grenade can kill you trough wall - Stupid wallbangs - Lots of cheaters - Viruses 
1080	1	a	ThabeToX,ExE GH0$T-R1D3R Those my name
4434	1	a	The Most Aggressive, Awesome,Shooter That dated back then when it was made.It Was the best shooter ever since Halo Combat Evolved Came Out. And It's still popular today.So I,personally think you should buy it.It's Only 10.00,And then,if you have kids let them play it when there older,And then let their kids,kids play it,And so on and so on... So Really Buy This Game To Experience What The Gameplay Feels Like.
3360	1	a	the goat of all fps games no other games compare to this amazing fps it started a movement in esports :) 10/10 buy this game and enjoy
574	1	a	the legend
1837	1	a	I'm playing in this game since 2000! (CS Beta 7.1) It's my 1st favorite game!
4507	1	a	Best gave what i ever player xx
6	1	a	CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).
2479	0	a	Not worth the nostalgia, clunky and slow. You're better off getting Counter Strike : Global Offensive

429	1	a	Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with Ð¡S: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..  
4719	1	a	The game that started the Counter Strike franchise and probably one of the best. Counter Strike didn't have the graphics but it had the gameplay we all know to love in a CS game.
2457	0	a	It isn t working!! i bought it at twice on 2 profiles and it always tell me error; Couldn t find UserMsgBase pointer. ... who knows how to repair it? 
2606	1	a	A clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ of prepubescent children. Famous for the useless â¥â¥â¥â¥ people stick on their servers. Also home of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ and according to Hilary Clinton causes the most school shootings after Doom. Cunter-Strike is a Massively Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter mod for the hit online electronic computing internets machine game 'Half-life' made many years ago.   It is aimed at brainless 13 year old boys and lifeless nerds who think it's cool, not knowing it's a secret recruiting tool for the special forces. Though of course no one can actually get into them, and real tools who can't distinguish between gaming and IRL bad ideas join the army. (Please note, if you're playing this game, you are gay. There is no hope, other than learning how to play better.)   Note: Requirements include being a â¥â¥â¥ and looking like Brian Peppers.
947	1	a	In my opinion, CS is the single greatest first-person shooter ever created. Complex, addictive, challenging, intense, precise, and infinitely replayable, CS was the defining game for an entire generation of gamers. But be warned, this game is absolutely brutal if you are new to shooters.
4511	1	a	horrible gfx
2036	1	a	why i cant config video. Now more large.
659	1	a	I think every huge counter strike fan should own this game. This was the beginning of the online fps genre and was a huge point in online history
3396	1	a	I bought this game because of memories when I was playing CS 1.6 and all I can tell is that this game looks bit different than 1.6 :D but that doesn't matter.    PROS
2974	1	a	This is a classic and better first person shooting game the history.
4971	1	a	Best of classic!
4141	1	a	play this its badass
291	1	a	To be honest one of the best fps of all time.I come back to this game every day or two.If you are going to buy it be awere that there is almost no STEAM servers so you will play with non-steam players
1316	1	a	A cheap and simple FPS shooter. 10/10
2790	1	a	Pretty Dope
4770	1	a	Great game!
1180	1	a	When you just want to shoot people in the face and rage because they shot you in the face, play this.
3517	1	a	Great Game.
144	1	a	Its old game Bat steal playing all world.. :)
908	1	a	Great fps for someone who is just looking for some fighting action. graphics are still great for such an old game and servers still get filled!
1888	1	a	I can review the game      when i dont have it :^)

1887	1	a	2 addictive!!!!!! *_^
880	1	a	hello.... here i m scorpion .... i m owner of gs......
317	1	a	The BEST game
236	1	a	Can shoot terrorists and be terrorist. Can plant bomb as terrorist.  Counter-Strike predicting ISIS before it even existed confirmed? More updates as they come.   UPDATE: Valve has replied to my message, and only said 'Never email us again or we will ban your Steam account'. Yes. So I wondered, what if I ran this through my decoder machine? So I ran it through my decoder machine. And it came out as this lonely message: Trump did 7/11.  What could it mean? I'm not really sure. I'll keep you guys posted.   UPDATE #2: I've done extensive research, and it appears that this decoded message either means that Donald J. Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point I'm not entirely sure which it is. If you have insight into this topic, please reach me at  xXilluminartyboizXx@internetexplorer.com . Thanks.   UPDATE #3: This might be my final update. I found a note slipped into my underwear when I woke up this morning. It was adressed from Valve. I opened it, naturally. Inside was one, simple sentence: Trump sees all.   Guys, listen, I don't know for sure if Trump did 7/11, or he made ISIS, or anything, but it's been fun trying to figure it out. If I don't make it to another update, and they get to me first, just tell my hamster Poochins that I loved him. Peace out.
3678	1	a	Amazing .. I love this Counter-Strike ..
2475	0	a	i dont know is it ebcause i didnt play it when it was first out but to me it seems â¥â¥â¥â¥ theres no competive mode and the graphics arent good either gameplay is good but id just get global offensive

3113	1	a	This is a great game. Very different from go
885	1	a	Pretty good. OLDSCHOOL
2459	0	a	There is a huge lump in my throat as I edit this review. If you own this game and reading reviews for fun, keep scrolling. So this game is only MP without mods and its dying atleast here in my country(India) and its $10 which is way too expensive in terms of our currency. Get the physical copy of Counter-Strike Anthology from a local/online retailer which will have half the price of this game alone without any sale! RIP Counter-Strike 1.6 :(
3578	1	a	classic counterstrike
4666	1	a	i think this games a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, cuz my game froze up and crashed, so i restarted my comp, and loaded cs go, come to find out i am banned from competitive play for a week....... ty steam for having such â¥â¥â¥â¥in great laggy servers..... â¥â¥â¥â¥ers...

3810	1	a	This game meant some unforgetable memories for many.
2528	0	a	For Nostalgia only the game has aged horribly, not only the graphics, but also the gameplay, and the multiplayer is overrun with cheaters and nerds, ugh, some games are better left in the past, where they belong
305	1	a	.
4116	1	a	this is really fun
873	1	a	This is one of those game that will never be bored ... :)
1610	1	a	The good old Counterstrike never seems tiring and boring. I still play it till date alongwith Counterstrike : Global Offensive. Valve should release update for the remaining bugs and glitches and revamp the graphics keeping the gameplay same.
2109	1	a	+++

3686	1	a	This is a great game that really stood the test of time. It's hitscan can even been seen as better than cs go. The shooting is smooth
5254	1	a	Very cool game , if u dont have PC worth fortune and You like to play with other ppls , this game is for You.  Try it !
3098	1	a	ok, i love the game, but i kinda messed up the resolution, and now it makes my game huge and i cant see most of the screen. what do i do to fix it? 
660	1	a	Half-Life: Counter-strike has redefined online play. This game has more potential and more online gaming goodness than any other game I've ever played. Finding good servers is always a concern when it comes to online play. As perhaps the most popular multi-player game in town, CS features literally thousands of servers at any one time. You'll almost always find guys to play with. 
277	1	a	Who didn't play this awesome game while growing up? Oh ya... me. And boy did I miss out!
69	1	a	Play this game to understand why we say this game is the best FPS of one in the world.  Counter-Strike is release over 10 years. but a lot of player still play this game. (including me).  Why? Because is so easy, fun, and memory. I am play Counter-Strike started in 2002 to now. is over 10 years.  Is like Half - Life . This game is revolution in FPS.
3002	1	a	I played this game for over 5 years when i was young, brings me back so many memories!
2163	1	a	Lot of mods. Good game.
4936	1	a	Really reccomended game!
772	1	a	very nice game! if you wanna be good cs:go players you must start from this game!
2560	0	a	My mouse sucks with this game it keeps teleporting
4621	1	a	The Best and the Legend among MP games :) &lt;3
1337	1	a	The game is good, I'm playing it for 2-3 years and I am stupend, good graphics and good resolution, I recomend this game is interesting
3762	1	a	If you are used to playing CSGO then you would need to adjust a little bit to get the hang of the game.
2406	0	a	that's it! i cant take this anymore. im not buying anymore of valves classic games. it's just too old! i'm trying to look for instant respawn servers but i cant find any. the only good classic game valve made would be the old half life's but i can't take this anymore! Tf classic, day of defeat and now this. i'm sorry, i'm done, i'm actually done!
1604	1	a	It's a good game but i got some kinda grapical bug and i need very much help and i can't see my grapical settings just cuz somthing makes me see a little bit of the menu screen would like some help :D
5147	1	a	:)))
817	1	a	Mother of CS  Setmasters 4 life  One of the most successful games
5198	1	a	So get your ideas, stack your ammo But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle This is it â it's what you eat, sleep, â¥â¥â¥â¥ and sh it Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
4127	1	a	If you are not into achievements, unlocks, stats and all that bs then this is the best fps out there to date. Pure tactics and aim skills are what matters.  Too bad it's been dropped from esports and overtaken by GO and it's awesome weapon skins, and soon to be TF2 hats. 
2513	0	a	A fun walk down nostalgia lane. That being said, I haven't seen a reason to replay this game in some time.
4549	1	a	awesome game best multiplayer for me .... :D
3153	1	a	*_*
3984	1	a	The best FPS ever!
549	1	a	the besttttttt

1040	1	a	The best FPS's of all time for its time and still and a great alive community.
3843	1	a	Better than CSGO
1683	1	a	How to be cs:go pro  1. Buy c-s 2. Launch it up and leave it on for 2 weeks straight 3. get over 100 hours of c-s and then brag about it on your next cs:go comp game how you played with the best pros back in the day  10/10 still best game and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s better than cs:go
2283	1	a	childhood
2271	1	a	Its just a very old game, but its still one of the best games! ;) First king of FPS Games, bestseller.. what else? Brilliant!
398	1	a	The greatest multiplayer shooter experience I've had since Quake 1. The e-sport scene also helped it alot, it's the only computer game I've really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when I followed the CPL etc). The design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The Call of Duty and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like Counter-Strike.
1012	1	a	=)
4166	1	a	Some stupid update, cannot even load the game, what is this crap? I've been playing it for 1 year and no problems, now i just done this update and i cannot even load it? what is this
1567	1	a	!!!!!!!!
4469	1	a	I spent 10 years playing this game. What more can be said?
5041	1	a	game is great(as ypu know it) but valve isn't working on it at all now cares about counter-strike:global offensive, there is too many servers with players downloaded it from some other site for free R.I.P. CS (1999-2012)
2512	0	a	That's a good game
854	1	a	..... long time player. like it.,
1148	1	a	~!!!
2321	1	a	The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics. Mediocricity Sells.

1463	1	a	Counter Strike is a great game. Even though it has outdated graphics it still has great gameplay. There are different game modes. 1 is where you have to defuse a bomb or plant a bomb and the other you have to rescue hostages and thats just to name a few. You will definetley enjoy playing this game.

Why would anyone buy this when there are free games like battlefield:heroes that have better graphics and control better. Also, the amount of hacking in this game is tremendous, i join a server and about 30% of the people playing are using some form of hacx. The biggest rip-of off my life.
2083	1	a	I love counter-strike 1.6
2017	1	a	Best game tbh :)

1237	1	a	Classic multiplayer shooter, one of the best!
39	1	a	This game appears to remain No. 1 FPS Action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years. It is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs. You should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common CS maps like dust or assault. Go on try it!  However they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame Tactical Shield. And cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online, that some PC criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. So you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and Steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and VAC banned, so please be careful!  But if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...BUY IT, SOLDIER!
3919	1	a	An absolute classic to say the least. One of the coolest shooters to grace the point and click medium.

2552	0	a	One of the most over-rated game ever. Other mods died while CS didnt die when it should have. The lack of changes and improvements to the base game trough years is utterly disgusting and not a proper excuse. Character slows down when its shot? Server side location tracking instead of client based for better accurate data? Years behind other mods, that died.
3102	1	a	Quite simply the best first person shooter.
2886	1	a	Its the most ultimate game a person can ever play !!! Love Everything about it !!!
1036	1	a	2600hs in steam 10years in nosteam  the best game
3792	1	a	Best game in the history of steam.
3207	1	a	Still the best FPS
302	1	a	17-04-14 new update. Game doesnt even open.  Error: Fatal Error- Cannot load Library. Please fix. Unbale to open CS 1.6
1599	1	a	My story began with the Counter-Strike of 2007 to the end now
3508	1	a	Old timeâ¤ï¸
4391	1	a	1 of the best classic games
1427	1	a	You better have a really beefy pc to run this game
3059	1	a	2 minutes of silence for all the deaths in de_dust2
5	1	a	I never played a better first person shooter. Graphics doesn't matter for gamer, gameplay only.
3121	1	a	Better than source
3176	1	a	I played it a lot many years ago. Now, I returned to it. Since I am grown up man, I feel like computer games are not important in my life anymore. BUT!!! I played Counter-Strike again, after 6 years... and... it's still on. It's still so brilliant and addictive and genius. Really, I like it, I LOVE IT!!! I never forget about it. I am acting like a counter-strike-teenage-boy again and I fell I made a right decision, returning back to this game...
2559	0	a	Dont buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ !
4642	1	a	One of the all time greatest FPS ever made.
3471	1	a	BEST GAME FROM 2000!

1781	1	a	One of the best games everrr :3
2998	1	a	Very Nice 'Old-School' Game
2537	0	a	Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer 'Terrorist plant C4' mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, 'de', is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, 'cs', in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press 'b' button (or whichever you set) to bring up 'buy menu', where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is 'pew pew pew can't hit'. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.  But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.
1718	1	a	you will be missed
4266	1	a	The best on the world
3553	1	a	10/10. really fun.
739	1	a	great game :)
744	1	a	Even though, I haven't played it too much, this game is a must-have shooter! It also has a really good price, so there's no reason not to buy it...
2615	1	a	Great team based game where you HAVE to utilize your teammates abilities and yours to go far and dominate.
2393	0	a	First please read the review because there are a lot of fanboys who downvote all negative ones just because you want me to think perfectly of this game!  Well first of all i wanna say i dont have much to say other than this game is amazing i have played it my entire life but not the steam version a pirated version and please dont hate me for that but the most stable version of this game is pirate version wanna know the reasons why? ok fine here they are: 1.CL_flushentitypacket error which is extremely annoying given the fact that it will lagg you out and it cant be fixed because most of the servers are against the fix and usually that fix doesnt even work. While that error occurs on pirated version too it occurs really rarely while on steam version it doesnt stop the whole damn game and it is either the server that will kick you for using that fix or VAC that will kick you if you are lucky and ban you and you arent even using the third party software!!! its a console FLIPPING COMMAND!!! 2.There are a ton of servers that have a virus that will rebind all of your keys to join their server once you join the server for the first time and honestly i dont know how will this benefit either the owner of the server or you because you cant even play the server normally you will just reconnect all over again when you try to do something and in all honesty if you do such thing on your server â¥â¥â¥â¥ you and i hope you get cancer. But you might be thinking how is this connected to not buying this game? well simple and i have 2 reasons for that. First reason is that why do you want to spend money on a game that has this type of issue and second of all the reason why this is a biggie is that in pirated version of the game you can change your binds and it will all save but unlike the steam version the 'Synchronizing feature' will save stuff but if you change the binds it will come back because people who use this exploit can work their way around it and trust me you will encounter a lot of servers like that. But trust me i dont hate this game in fact this is the game that got me into pc gaming back in 2004 but is it worth it buying a game that doesnt benefit you in any way as a legal version? of course not but its not me thinking that this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ in fact its evolutionary its perfect and i have spent 1000+ hours outside of steam version and i gotta say i have been getting a lot less errors and a lot less â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t messages from vac for me trying to fix this error and a lot less problems than i had with the LEGAL VERSION THAT SHOULD BE MORE OF A QUALITY THAN THE ILLEGAL VERSION!. And im not promoting piracy in fact i think its lame but this is the game that should be pirated because it doesnt offer anything good in legal version in fact it downgrades a lot but when there are 50000 people that are hidden off your charts of cs 1.6 just because they wanna play normally and pirate the game there is something seriously wrong with the legal version and i really dont recommend buying this its the same as the pirated version but with more game breaking stuff! 
2721	1	a	Counter-Strike is one of those games that still has people playing on servers 15 years later and probably still will due to it's addictive and competitive gameplay. Strongly Recommend it. 10/10
1320	1	a	BEST CS EVA
458	1	a	Cool and classic.who love this oldschool game.you can try!
4055	1	a	Its a great game first version of counterstrike and the best of them all, 1,6 ftw pro game

1116	1	a	10/10 would headshot you in the face again
3198	1	a	Get on a non-steam server. Wreck everyone. Get banned/destroyed.  10/10 would give my soul again.  P.S these hours are just on steam, i've recently purchased this game, i've played since when i was 4 years old, like 20 hours a week, so 602 hours is just like a .. extra i've played, now i'm 16 years old.
4026	1	a	This game is the best Counter Strike game EVER!
5129	1	a	Classic game !
4954	1	a	Amazing shooter!!! it would definitely be in my top 10 shooter games of all time
142	1	a	The best Action Game Ever
2675	1	a	The only extremely good Counter-Strike game, unforunately they updated it and things got a bink wonky, but it's still more impressive than CS:GO.
3433	1	a	Good game high skill cap, grand father of CS:GO or Great grand father, is what I should say.
1002	1	a	Counter-strike(1.0 - 1.6 not source) is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does...:D
2973	1	a	I played this since 15 years, i still playing it. Totally Reccomended
1043	1	a	Really Good Game!
2733	1	a	+
2345	0	a	hello....not good, maybe anyone can help me, i cant play counter strike, every time i connect to some server, sometimes it allowed me to play but sometime not, its connectic to other servers all the time, like reconnecting....showing that loading bar...precaching items or something like that....very sad i both this game only yesterday, one more thing...tried to purchase a gift for my friend...they took my money, but didnt gave my friend a gift, nothing.....
3815	1	a	This game will always be 10/10

602	1	a	The mother of all FPS's around. Definitely recommended.
2505	0	a	Terrible game. 1/10 WOULD NOT PLAY.
4818	1	a	Still the best counter strike game !
4829	1	a	...
469	1	a	it's ok
2549	0	a	terrible game.    waste of money.
526	1	a	Best of Counter Strike!
4913	1	a	never gets bored of this game :)
1870	1	a	I will never forget these days and months that I spend to throw grenades on de_dust 2x2 or killing zombies with machinegun and run for my life. Goodnight, sweet prince.
2469	0	a	it's way too â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to play!
4241	1	a	ill highly recommend this game fun!
573	1	a	FFS DUDE WTF HOW CAN U NOT OWN THIS GAME U PIECE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥ , IF U DONT OWN THIS GAME THEN UR NOT A REAL GAME U â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ SO U BETTER BUY IT QUICK BEFORE PEOPLE START LAUGHING AT U , U â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ , AND IF U DONT HAVE MONEY FOR IT GO ROB A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BANK â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
4986	1	a	This is the best game of all the CS games. The only downside is that it is an outdated game, and it's not really worth getting into it now. If you're barely getting into Counter-Strike, then just go for Global Offensive, it's the better choice for the new players.
2397	0	a	There are NO good servers on any more.
2015	1	a	Was a pleasure ... while it lasted.
990	1	a	I ran out of spawn in a map called de_dust 2 running for b bombsite and got awped in the head, 1337/10 would run again.
2845	1	a	:********
4098	1	a	olldd but golldd the best game ever!!!!
2956	1	a	Saw a hostage pick up a Mac-10 and kill a terrorist.  10/10 recommend CSGN.
1647	1	a	Good Game and i Loved it so much
3117	1	a	The most classic FPS game. Counter-Strike is a mod of the legendary Half-Life by Valve. Even if it was released at 1999, people still play it due to its essential playabillity. It contains a lot of different gamemodes and you can easily learn how to play it. I recommend it.
2522	0	a	in this game u shoot and its sucks
1481	1	a	...
4221	1	a	Best Game i ever Played :D
1090	1	a	hi    this is best game in my life  and i love my cs
137	1	a	Old but still the best
127	1	a	Greatest game ever.
4374	1	a	This game as its released a long time ago, but it still carries the compitive sense, unlike the new versions of counter strike (source and Go), playing this game is fun and i think it would remain as a favourite game as much as i play anymore games.
1946	1	a	Old Style :D
5151	1	a	Epic game, everything started there
4302	1	a	A must-have. This is the granddaddy of online shooters. GET IT.
2841	1	a	thats pefect to pro players with steam you can make screenshots and upload it on steam account and facebook too. thats got very good 3D settings that settings helps to low videocards . if you download it you can play original and good game with official files i like steam
1487	1	a	What else is there left to say about Counter-Strike. Are you a FPS god, love fancy knifes, guns and killing all your friends? Then this game is probably for you. For everybody else, us FPS noobs, this is a fun past time with your equally bad friends. Learn how to crouch, how to hide and how to be called a 'stupid, sniping c**t'. Just buy the game already!
3165	1	a	Great shoot game!
4186	1	a	:)
189	1	a	The foundation of my gaming. Excellent game. Its time has passed but it will always be remembered as one of the finest competitive games I've ever played. May you rest in peace 1.6. You lived a great life.
1308	1	a	The next best version of Counter-Strike after the now defunct CS 1.5.
776	1	a	Still better love story than twilight 11/10
3921	1	a	All of those highschool feels
4652	1	a	1337
274	1	a	umm I'll have you know, I've been playing since CS 0.000009
107	1	a	CS is fast paced, intense. this game will not disappoint. The 'just one more round' addiction factor is very high. I've been addicted since 2007. I don't have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing vision for what i am saying. I'm making this â¥â¥â¥â¥ up as I go. Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and if you enjoy it you will NEED it!

3501	1	a	10/10 i already played the pirated version.
4493	1	a	I LOVE THIS OLDSQL GAME - MY BROTHER PLAYS I MORE THEN MYSELF, BUT IT WOULDNT BE BORING :P:P
4725	1	a	Wohohooh
3741	1	a	Still unsure about how good of a game this is!  Edit. Why did i lose so many hours over the years??
450	1	a	Counter-Strike was one of the first video games I have ever played and will always be up there in my list of favorite games.  I had just installed it. It was my first multiplayer game and I though I'm too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didn't even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.  After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...  I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didn't even play the classic mode, it wasn't of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.  I can't not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it. Nostalgia.
2074	1	a	9/10
1882	1	a	Old but good.
60	1	a	A must have classic.
2086	1	a	Very good game :) Recommended.
1486	1	a	Despite its age, this shooter has not lost its appeal and is still one of the best shooting games of all time.
4060	1	a	yup, still works
687	1	a	10/10  Roses are red CTs are blue I cant bhop And that is true
4120	1	a	play for funn
325	1	a	all these years and still playing this, says how good the game is.
678	1	a	  I love this game a lot!
2146	1	a	Nice game
3518	1	a	dont be a baby like colty, buy this game. came out 16+ years ago, im not a veteran and even I enjoy playing it
3480	1	a	This was once a popular FPS mod for Half-life, a popular game of 1998. I have ever single Counter Strike game including a steamed version of Counter Strike 1.0. But I do not have the Korean version of Counter Strike and CS:GO is mostly because of its toxic community, anyways I give this game a 10/10.
2685	1	a	The real pillar of all FPS games ever to sprout out into the competitive scene. It's been around for as long as I can remember and has literally changed the eSports scene. Very balanced and runs on one of the smoothest engines every made for a first person shooter. The game is outdated now and its successor CS:GO is doing a good job at satisfying the professional scene while maintaining a very challenging and exciting gameplay
742	1	a	good game i like it very much :))
30	1	a	I've had lots of fun with this game. Graphics are outdated but community is still here to support it.
4450	1	a	Great fun! What's not to love?
62	1	a	Think you got skills because you came from CS:GO?  Think you got skills cause you came from COD?  Think you got skills cause you just bought fallout 4 and still got money left on your steam account?   Well let me tell you a story.         You're going to suck â¥â¥â¥.       Alot of â¥â¥â¥.
2535	0	a	Classic game. Very innovative at its time and it's fun to play. You should get its second remake Counter-Strike: Global Offensive though which is improved in almost every aspect of the game. Only get this if you're a nostalgic freak :-)
5197	1	a	this is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing best shooter in the world
726	1	a	good game when want hev fun
4370	1	a	Well, this is the one that basically started it all... An entertaining game that despite being old, its gold!  Cheap and a whole lot of fun.
1296	1	a	Best game ever... fact
1669	1	a	the best competitive FPS i've ever played. long live 1.6 ...
3371	1	a	First of all, let me start by saying this game used to be my religion 10 years ago, so I am probably biased.  So many years after its inception, the graphics for Counter-Strike do look pretty dated. of Compared to the quality standards of most of today's shooters, the original Counter-Strike (and likely its predecessors, which very much live in the same vein) may feel a bit rough, unpolished or even at times a bit corny (hostage sounds :p). Still, at it's core, the game is a fast-paced, trigger-reflex shooter.  Edit: I forgot to also include that you can use 'high definition' skins, textures and remodels for pretty much all assets in the game, so the game does have some degree of leeway and customization visually. Back in the day that was one of the things that made this game the bees knees for me. Swapped out my in-game AUG with the model and txt information an LA80, hell yeah! Not a fan of desert eagles? How does a .44 magnum revolver give you the feels? You can also edit the sound files. I remember downloading some sound pack that made Rob Zombie's Dragula play as the round start sound effect and it was almost a month until I finally changed it, to the point where now, 10 years later, I still expect to hear Dragula when I play Counter-strike. These are the things that make me feel nostalgic and think of the late 90s and early 2000; they became iconic for me.   This game is all about making your shots count before the other guy gets his in. Deaths come quickly, wins feel rewarding. The games are split up into objective-based perma-death rounds. If you are a terrorist, you may have to plant a bomb (edgy, I know, but remember how old this game is- concepts came way before 9/11 and the explosion of modern terrorism, etc) and if you found yourself on the Counter-terrorist team, your objective would be to find and secure or disarm the bomb before it's detonated. Each round can also be completed deathmatch style by wiping out the enemy team (indeed, this will usually happen in most cases as each team pushes towards their respective objective)  Occasionally, due to the respectable size and intelligent layout of the maps, there will come situations where there are only one or two players left alive on each team and both teams must aggressively pursue the objective. You've never experienced tension until you have 40 seconds to defuse a bomb and you don't know where the devil who planted it went. You attempt to disarm it while there's still time. You hear footsteps behind you. Your hair trigger reflexes can save you. Will you come out on top?  There are still hundreds, maybe thousands of public Counter strike servers available, and a good number of players to populate them (though many servers are ghost or bot servers also). Most of them (95%) will run some sort of addons and plugins but they install automatically on the fly as needed on your client so you dont have to worry about extra downloads. These addons will range from subtle things that enhance game functions like realtime stats, to comical sound effects (I've heard the 'HEAD SHOT!' callout from Unreal Tournament in CS more than I have from playing any UT game) to absolutely ridiculous and gamechanging, to the leveling Warcraft 3 hero addon where you can get a chain lightning spell XD to being able to deploy a parachute whenever you want to to avoid any fall damage.  It is a bit old, so if that word alone scares you you may want to avoid the original CS (and possibly the newer ones as well, as they play very similarly) but if you enjoyed the Half-Life series (the engine) and you like modern shooters and want to try one with some good pace, try Counter-Strike. Where a game of Call of Duty or the like would typically degenerate into a full on bloodbath where nothing is sacred and everyone is shooting you from behind, Counter Strike has pacing; every round can play out completely different from the last, depending on the tactics used by each team and the route they choose to take towards their objective.   It's far from perfect, but it will always have a special place in my heart. &lt;3  There was a time, when, if you wanted to flashbang your team and hear their cries of anguish, this was pretty much the only game you could do it in.  10/10 for flashbang memories
1027	1	a	Better than the Entire CoD, BF, and any other team based FPS franchise.
500	1	a	))))
1769	1	a	A fun classic FPS game made by valve that takes strategy and teamwork.

120	1	a	nice game...very nice
1833	1	a	Wait, what is this? Counter-Strike?! Yes.. It's Counter-Strike.. the old FPS Game.. I've loved this game very much.. It's my Childhood Game.. This game doesn't have it's amazing duper 2014 graphics, but instead.. It's the gameplay we're talking about... So the Gameplay.. It's very fun but bit serious if you can ask me.. this game made me very serious at some period of time but the gameplay is still pretty fun.. and to derp around with it.. such as editing it's textures and etc.. I've seen people having troubles playing this game online because full of try-hards or any pros out there.. well there's no bots included in Counter-Strike but you can go practice at Counter-Strike Condition Zero, it has bots..  This game isn't free and you have to buy it. I'll only suggest people who really likes Old FPS or Competitive Gaming around here!~ Game on mates! I highly suggest you buy this game for the people who really likes FPS here..
2907	1	a	i never played it
163	1	a	(RADIO): Fire in the hole! You got flashed and got stuck in the corner by a teammate (RADIO): Fire in the hole!,(RADIO): Fire in the hole!,(RADIO): Fire in the hole! And both die from a grenade gg nice game will rush again with him

3189	1	a	Nice game
1066	1	a	.
4239	1	a	GREAT GAME! MUST TRY!
2177	0	a	Eh, its alright
150	1	a	One of the best games ever out there. Yes, it is old but it is JUST amazing. Much better than CoD; and just as good as Battlefied 3 or 4 maybe :P. There are many things tod if you get bored of the tactical playing in games. You can bhop, deathrun, surf and a lot of other things. This honestly should be a $60 game for how good it actually is. So just get this game as it is simply amazing!
1435	1	a	From my personal experience i think is the best multiplayer game ever created.  The one and only.
5001	1	a	This game is just as good as it was 10 years ago. It's the Tetris of FPS. You will still find tons of people to play with (half of them annoying kids, just like 10 years ago) and find yourself neglecting your modern games...
135	1	a	Forever Retro! Current!
2480	0	a	This game sucks for 4 reasons: 1. Its now outdated, and there are better/newer ones. 2. Its purely multiplayer, not even bots to practice. 3. Its super boring even if you play with people you know. 4. People complain if you loose. Chill, its just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game! Thats about it. I dont suggest this to anyone unless they want to waste their money.
3097	1	a	Counter-Strike is a classic team-based multiplayer game combining fast gameplay with a simple map system of planting/defusing bombs and rescuing/holding hostages. The game established many basic multiplayer features that are now taken for granted in newer multiplayer games.
2865	1	a	the best multiplayer game ever :) . .. .
710	1	a	Simply still the best Counter-Strike ever made.
5015	1	a	U Had to start somewhere &lt;3
4889	1	a	If you're on Steam and you haven't played, or own this game, just kill yourself.
5145	1	a	nice game ever
2006	1	a	I recommend it. Because of the skins. They are awesome.
1388	1	a	:)
68	1	a	Awesome oldschool game ;)
5134	1	a	Better Graphics than CS:GO, would recommend.
3131	1	a	Here's my 12 word review for this beautiful game. Every time i play this it takes me back to my childhood.
1100	1	a	One and only CS-game out there
3757	1	a	wallbang is real
1554	1	a	If you hate this game, visit the doctor.
2250	1	a	One of the best game ever xdd
1048	1	a	This game have a nice place in my heart, 10/10 &lt;3
4827	1	a	If you think that de_dust2 is boring you can play its lego version on pokemon diablo2 warcraft mod bunnyhopping shooting green beams and lightning bolts at zombie chickens. Easy modding.
19	1	a	I only write this because of how nostalgic I feel. The game that gave me my passion for shooters. Hands down, in my opinion, best game made in history.  This game, I cannot explain how many emotions it gave me, and thousands or millions of other players.  Cs 1.6, please stay alive.   Pros- Everything Cons- Nothing
4849	1	a	Old but gold!
2554	0	a	It's so boring it'll put you to sleep! A must have gay game!.....NOT! Do you love spawning every 5 seconds and then dieing instantly? Then this game's for you! Do you love hackers? Then this game's for you! Do you love outdated graphics? Then this game's for you! ZZZzzz....
2509	0	a	in 2011, I would have recomended this game, but sadly, it has degenerated beyond recognition. its sad to see such a great game fall. you need only join a server once to see that cs 1.6 is no more. get cs cz or cs source as theyre better choices these days.
439	1	a	Great Classic,still popular

4094	1	a	
4160	1	a	Revolutionized FPS gaming &amp; pretty much made it what it is today. Literally was the greatest FPS games back in the day.
2889	1	a	This game has a odd aiming system compared to CSGO and CSS so this is a true classic and it is still fun today but it does show its age a little. 8.9/10
858	1	a	Really, this game requires skill. Not for the casual gamer.
2762	1	a	Best first person game ever....^_^ Do u love first person game..dont have graphic card....this is the game meant for u.......^_^

5242	1	a	the best
4415	1	a	cs 1.6 is probably the best yet team based fps game, go is a step up from source but its a very debatable topic that it is AS good as 1.6. Definately not better though.

3765	1	a	cs is lyfe
5085	1	a	The best CS Game Ever !  I feel This game was made for me xD
3442	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
2986	1	a	Awsome Game.

4198	1	a	why it! wruth me : ''failed to initazile authentication interface. Exiting... ''
3577	1	a	Best game to play if you have a potato. It still is a very fun game despite dated graphics. However, if you have a good computer and can run the newer games, then there isn't much point to playing this one, unless you're like me and enjoy playing older games. The gameplay is rather different from the newer games. For one, this one is much harder. It feels like the first Rainbow Six at times.
4354	1	a	One of the greatest games ever made. Not active now, but in its prime this game was amazing.
2979	1	a	.

3193	1	a	5 years back was really addictive game. 10/10
4513	1	a	I recommend playing it !
2608	1	a	One of the best FPS games!!!
54	1	a	Such a highly reccomended game for those who want to get it, playing this game in 2016 reminds me of the old style games i used to play on the playstation 2.  I recently came back to play this game due to the fact Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is simply a great game and wanting to seen the origin.  10/10
3123	1	a	3123213
4735	1	a	Old School :)
2917	1	a	its a cool game 
1395	1	a	  CS 1.6
4871	1	a	Probably the best game EVER!
4861	1	a	Played Csgo for 800 hours, decided to play cs 1.6 and gets wallbanged almost every round. Decided to quit cause of 'hackers'. Watches youtube and see's that mostly every map is wallbangable and deletes the game. 11/10 would Wallbanged again.
2012	1	a	This MMORPG is off the chain! The story line is really intriguing and the in-game NPCs are just a delight! 2 thumbs WAY up ur butt
4488	1	a	A game that made history! 1.6 4ever!
4560	1	a	nice Game forever~~~~~ =DD
1793	1	a	Yes turns you into a hs God that is all 
3566	1	a	!
2193	1	a	If you're a die hard CS fan you need to play the game that started it all. CS 1.6 was such a good game from the start and only got better. This game started so many things for eSports that many cannot truly appreciate.
5095	1	a	Sometimes when people see other people's discussions about thing that they dont spend much time on, they believe this opinion wont be good 9 times out of 10. As for me, i've been playing this game for 10 years and only in 2015 i got it in steam. If i could count the hours i had played, i would have been about 8-9k hours. So, i think every person that likes shooters started to play this game in the beginning. Recommend it for everyone
4547	1	a	this game is aMazing
2710	1	a	Almost 7 years of playing this game and still goin' on! I hope it will not die because of global offensive. It will be a good idea to introduce steam achievements/trading cards for it, because it's a very played game
2288	1	a	this game is the 1# online action game is awesome, it's better than Team fortress games and other mutiplit-player games
2544	0	a	Cheaters only trust me it's gross
4238	1	a	check out this hot game!

3093	1	a	It's a must have, no question asked. If you don't own it, go to the nearest mirror, slap yourself, look how stupid you look. Once you're done with this bad advice I gave you, return to your computer &amp; add the game to your Steam cart &amp; purchase it right away. [Don't do tomorrow what can be done today.]
3140	1	a	Nice game :)
3737	1	a	Vote this for The âTest of Timeâ Award
491	1	a	This is probably the game that set the foundation for Steam. This game has aged quite well, with its balance of original team based strategy and maps like de_dust 2 are legendary. This is without a doubt one of the greatest computer games of all time!

3593	0	a	this game is sh*t literaly. Most of the servers are ok but when you shoot your gun you really cant tell where your bullets are landing after that. Also the registration is crap as well. Dont buy this game unless you want to get sh*tted on by a bunch of perubian butt pirates who cant afford anything or run anything else besides this terrible game.
3161	1	a	Although i have minimal play time on this game, its because i play CSGO a lot more but this game was a blast to play as even though it has low resolution, it brings fun in a nut-shell however if you love CSGO this one is a bit more complex. The slight lag you may get doesn't matter as its minimal. 9.5/10
351	1	a	Why i have low fps   but nice game :D
2357	1	a	I shoot bullets at a person, and they die from it.  Sometimes they do not.  Sometimes they shoot me.  Very deep storytelling.
1423	1	a	Best oldschool game ever, and still playable... but only one think is frustrating me is cheaters...
1151	1	a	Even after over 16 years on the video game market, Counter Strike claims thousands of followers.  Guns feel just right Maps feel just right Graphics look just right and isn't outdated at all(Youngsters not accustomed to late 1990s PC graphics might disagree).  You will play CS 1.6 FOREVER. I'll probably play CS 1.6 zombie mode until the I have arthritis.
5036	1	a	Best FPS game ever made and works great on mini laptops! :D
2966	1	a	Old but gold
1511	1	a	The first game that struck down like lightning, stole our souls and maked us fight with parents to make them understand that you can't PAUSE an ONLINE game.  I remember the early day's of playing and the less than professional LAN parties we arranged in someones house. I can't think of ANYONE in my hometown that did not play this game (BEFORE STEAM even existed) This was the game that brought us all together on weekends, schoolbreaks and we even went as far as moving large CRT monitors just to game. I would like to see the lazy youths of today arrange a LAN where everyone had to carry a large 19inch CRT monitor with them :)  All the drunken insanity of 20youths in a basement-LAN (NO INTERNET!), killing eachother and sharing files on DC++. This was GOOD times or maybe Im just nostalgic about it...  It stole my youth, costed A LOT of keyboards (JÃVLA AWP BÃG?!) and drove our parents insane. AND NO UPDATES BREAKING THE GAME ALL THE TIME LIKE CS: GO.  What you bought was what you got and not a different game every month due to updates...  10/10 would waste my youth on this game again
3970	1	a	Oh i miss the good ol days
3824	1	a	Why are you even reading these reviews, you already know what this is and waht it's like...

948	1	a	The best shooter,period.No game will ever come close to this one.Love it!
145	1	a	(I've deleted all the comments on this because I wanted to give a serious review about this game and delete my older one, so here ya go)  This is the older Counter-Strike as most people know it. Some people usually don't find enjoyment in playing it due to it being either 'out-dated' or 'glitchy'. I personally tend to enjoy this game from time to time because it's an original game made from the first Source engine, and old school shooters in general ain't too shabby either. Due to the game having a small amount of space to fill in your computer, it rarely ever lags, which makes sure of no interruptions to your enjoyment. It's also just as Competitive as the present Counter-Strike games, though there isn't any seperate Comp gamemode, unfortunately. But that's something that Valve decided to save for later purposes I suppose. Still the King of FPS Games (IMO), I would definetely recommend playing this if you enjoy tactical teamwork in your Online Gaming.

802	1	a	My life &lt; Counter Strike 1.6. Bought this game a bit too late... wish I would've been around to play it back in it's prime.
164	1	a	Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.
3338	1	a	A must-play game in my gen haha
4683	1	a	The greatest FPS game ever played.
4478	1	a	good game but complicated story

1715	1	a	Counter-Cstrike 1.6 is one of the best FPS games. You can do almost anything in it, which is pretty awesome, at least for me, when the player can modify things to his/her liking. You can choose from many modes, ex. Knife, Awp, Aim, Deathmatch, Surf, KreedZ, Zombie, CoD MW2, W3 FT and so on. You can change models/skins, try almost anything if not everything. It is a shame that so many people did not see its potential, but ofcourse, the time goes on &amp; the era changes, but no matter what, Counter-Cstrike 1.6 will always be my n1 OldSql game. Frankly speaking, I reccommend to try out this game to any FPS game lover, because I think he/she will not regret it. It is year 2o15 &amp; its community still lives, maybe with one foot in grave, but lives on. Thanks for any reader &amp; his time reading this.  Regards,  iMINDâ¢

1003	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb Maps: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage Maps: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP Maps: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.
2484	0	a	-Do you like empty servers? -Do you like a long list of empty servers? -Do you like servers with nothing but junk map after junk map and none of the originals? -Do you like boring themed gun play? -Do you like a chaos fest of 32 players on a small map? -Do you like to waste your money?   This game is for you! Once a great game, but no one plays it anymore. Which is a shame, CS:GO is trash.

2212	1	a	Hello, i play Counter-Strike 1.6 since i was 6 year old, now i`m 20, this game is unbeliveble, is like a drug, when you start it, you play it for life! I recommend this game!
4190	1	a	This is the OG game. #Classic. #Oldschool. The godfather of FPS shooters. There's a reason why it still has a strong playerbase, even stronger than it's successor CS:Source. Even with CS:GO out, it still has a healthy number of players. The gameplay and balance is still unrivaled. This was the platform Valve used to become the powerhouse it is today. Highly recommend even in 2014.

3493	0	a	Dont Buy This Game!  If you can buy the cs pack with all games for like 4 pound then sweet, give it a go, but if your like me and new to playing csgo you are not going to find the original that good.  Yes it would have been good back in the day, but csgo is were its at, and alot more fun, if you like hacking, and people harrasing each other, then play this game.
318	1	a	counter strike is game where i can learn only one thing that if u have a good aim on the head of ur enemy than u can kill them whatever u have latency but not more than 150 :D
4058	1	a	Always in my heart. An all time classic that I can never forget. I still love to play the eagle catch the chicken on de_dust 2. This game is just FUN! I don't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the graphics but this is better than all of the other.

3414	1	a	Played this game for far too long, sad to see the community die out but it was the most fun ive had on a game in my entire life and nothing will top it
3203	1	a	It's nothing like CS;GO as far as mechanics go. I say this because of how you control your character and spray control seems to be very different. The AK-47 has completely random spray pattern. It's not consistent! However the game itself is good, and provides a fair challenge for those who consider themselves to be good at CS;GO. Trust me, you will struggle at first.
743	1	a	The Best Game
1406	1	a	nice game, playing this game sometimes too feel nostalgia.

4737	1	a	top player ; top gamers ; old
840	1	a	This game is a timeless classic. It's one of the perfect FPS' that will ever be made. The movement, wall spamming, hitboxes, and map choices are what make this game the best. I've been playing this game since around 2003. Have played tournaments, been an admin for many clans, and strat caller for matches. This game takes serious skill to get good at. There is a huge learning curve, and that's what seperates this from other games, and noobs and pro's. The people who will get good at this game, are the ones who put the time and effort to learn everything. While the game can be a pick up and play game. Expect your â¥â¥â¥ to get handed to you, as veterans of the game still heavily play this, and they'll out shoot you 9/10 times. I have been called a cheater countless times in this game, and it all comes from me playing this day and night as a child, and my skills has also transferred into other FPS games. If you get good at CS, you'll more than likely be very good at other FPS games like Over Watch, CoD, 007, etc. Thats why I nominate this game for, The âTest of Timeâ Award. My friends think I'm dumb for playing a game developed in the 90's, but there's a reason for it. As I said, this game is the perfect FPS. It's a game I will play until I die. I can buy any new game on the market, and I'll be returning to this game shortly after. Take it from someone who has invested a lot of time in this game to get good. It's going to seem scary at first, as you will get rekt. But you will develop friends from within the various communities, and you will get better over time. And this skill set will make you better at other FPS games. CS 1.6 forever!

3015	1	a	great game
2573	0	a	Because I'm such a huge fan of CS:GO and CS:S, I decided to purchase and play the original Counter Strike. However good the game may be it's all based on petty nostalgia. If you were to compare the game to CS:S or CS:GO you would realize how inferior it really is to the two. You might say that CS:GO turned crap once Valve added cases and payed cosmetics, and in turn that makes CS 1.6 better than CS:GO. To that I say CS:GO has better graphics (no surprise) and better controls, if it's the payed skins that turn you away from the game then just don't buy skins/cases/keys. Overall I would say based on CS 1.6's time period it's a revolutionary game, however compared to modern choices the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥.  5/10
1827	1	a	this is some classic â¥â¥â¥â¥

5061	1	a	Very old fps shooter still at the top charts! SmaLler file that steam
972	1	a	Truely a game which signifies the value of 'Old is Gold'.... This shows that 'Graphics doesn't matter but Gameplay does'.... The Parent of First Person Shooting Multiplayer... Even though it's been more than a decade since its release but It's still one of the most favoured online games in the world. A must play for any die-hard First Person Shooter lover.
4029	1	a	The best fps game ever and the most addicted ! XD
2366	1	a	 I love Counter Strike, I should end it here. But I'll be honest and say I grew up with Source, wasn't old enough to experince 1.6 sadly. But giving it a try, it's very different, having to buy ammo, see what the original maps looked like before being changed in Source. And dealing with pros that somehow can deal with the game choppyness and inaccuracy. I'll stick with Source, but great game!  9/10
4923	1	a	1.6 4 life.
1421	1	a	this a good game i like the maps and the community in the game  
2831	1	a	One of my first FPS game shame that now is somewhat filled with mod and hackers this game is still fun and double Sin mind I spent with that crap out of call of duty on this game people spent years of their lives becoming stronger but even if you don't and the height of certain people you're still awesome

3639	1	a	Athough this isn't my first counter strike game nor my favorite, I still get this huge sense of nostalgia towards it. That late 90's FPS feel and the gritty nature of a low-budget mod gives the game it's charm.   Some things have not aged well, such as a search bar for server and the lack of customization options for your crosshair; i dunno, maybe I'm just spoiled.   This is probably the most difficult in the series for newcomers to get used to, but once you get the hand of the often clunkey controls and movement, it'll be an enjoyable experience.

1934	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME ON EARTH !!!!!!!!!!!!
344	1	a	maby the best game ever.
502	1	a	I really recommend this for people who want to play an old school, simple shooter. A lot of user created modes automaticly downloading in server joining. Really fun even though its old.
4878	1	a	A classic. Superior to CSGO in many sense IMO.
98	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nostalgic m8. Best sound N/A. Best Graphix N/A. Nothing better than good ol' 1.6.   And I am an Ex. Team 3D player.
2257	1	a	still like it, I remember when I played this before.
1748	1	a	Finally i buy that game! Awesome! :D (i`m not a VALVE`r now) &gt;:)
1627	1	a	LIFE IS 1 , BUT COUTER-STRIKE IS 1.6       CS 4 EVER  
1539	1	a	Oldschool game, but it's fun.
5071	1	a	its a great game but flaws pros: graphics,gameplay,guns,servers,(people still play) cons:lag,most servers are in other countries (i live in the us), but if you are a fan of fps go back to the classics 8/10 
1557	1	a	beast
1763	1	a	Really Awesome Game &lt;3
2370	1	a	Many people in this game have been playing since 1999+, and certainly have the skill to prove it. This game changed the gaming industry greatly, and is of very high quality, though ages like anything but a fine wine. Only get it if you have someone you know that can teach you how to play it. Otherwise stick with CS:GO.
301	1	a	~|^Kn!gHtM@Re^|~ Auto-Mix Server 103.2.238.234:27015  All the cs fans are welcomed..!
4989	1	a	*-*

4615	1	a	Worlds greatest first person shooter game!
816	1	a	i'm in love with CS
468	1	a	very much better tha csgo AND YOU KNOW
1708	1	a	Just Shooot The Zombies 
1241	1	a	Overrated, but it's good.
4453	1	a	This is the game that really defined cooperative play. A classic that to this day is one of the most played online games ever and should be for many years to come.
2180	1	a	old but good
103	1	a	legend in FPS game. legend is still alive. This is CS 1.6 !!!
2014	1	a	Bhop
3024	1	a	
635	1	a	Old but Gold :)
4842	1	a	After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can't be ignored. No other shooter is as accessible, easy to play, simple nor skillful as this. It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties. It's all about aim, accuracy, quick reflexes but does have a strategical element since it is a tactical shooter and there's no respawning. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular.
3028	1	a	OLDIE BUT GOLDIE !!
5059	1	a	Nice game, mann awesome game mode :)
2092	1	a	awesome sauce 
2308	1	a	I recommend any CS game
1616	1	a	full skills this game ;D
1722	1	a	Counter-Strike is one of the most popular games in the world, and for me, one of the best games ever. It doesn't have a beautiful graphic if you compare with other games, but who cares? It's so fun when you play with your friends in a LAN. This game is awsome!
4573	1	a	This Game is a 2. Best FPS. The 1. is a Half-Life
752	1	a	10/10
2356	1	a	Well this is my childhood game.When I was like 5 my dad instaled me the multiplayer one. It was nice but I didnt get a kill so I closed it and never open it again until now. :3
4941	1	a	cool
3129	1	a	.
260	1	a	Great!
1252	1	a	love this game
1508	1	a	 PROS:  + great gameplay + big active community + great choice of weapons + huge amount of mods + lots of community created maps, weapons, AI, soundtracks, etc.   CONS:  - rare issues with graphic cards (especially for laptops) - has replacement in form of newer CS games   Comment:  What is there to introduce? This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that don't should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its' younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counter-terrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.
160	1	a	It is a good Co-op game for online gamers.
5111	1	a	:)
1692	1	a	the real deal boys
2353	0	a	people said it was the best cs of all time so i figured i would pick it up. when i got into my first game, i had problems looking around... this didnt stop. im stuck sometimes looking at the ground and as much as i move my mouse im still looking at the ground. sometimes im looking at a wall, and i move my mouse as much as i can. but the mouse keeps going right back to the same place on the screen. please help, i cant play until this problem is fixed.
1417	1	a	.
597	1	a	BEST CLASSIC GAME EVER
4388	1	a	Very Good game the Best!
2338	0	a	I can't think of a single reason why someone would install this today. Used to be famous but is now archaic and empty. Those servers that do exist are full of non-English speaking hackers.
1598	1	a	The game is great. Has the full potential, the graphics and gameplay are doing it.
4622	1	a	From a multiplayer and competitive point of view, its the best or second best game (to Q2) in existence Graphics are somewhat dated
188	1	a	there is absolutely no need to review this game....!!! brilliant, fantastic..!!! well best online multiplayer game ever...!!!
3530	1	a	Counter-Strike is a multiplayer spin-off game to the Half Life franchise. Set in the same universe except focused on the HECU Marines themselves. There is no plot to this game, it's purpose is to establish a fun co-op multiplayer game that allows gamers to either fight it off or team up around the globe. There is a selection of different locations for the areas and different types of game play to create endless possible features wether you play as the marines or the terrorists is all up to you. This game was so successful it established a large fan base and spawn a few sequals. If you want to play a classic online multiplayer, you can't go more classic than this. If you manage to gather some friends who have their own Counter Strike games installed on their PC, then you will be all set.
3636	1	a	Nothing will ever beat the original.
3771	1	a	Greatest of all time.
4339	1	a	classic but great
3834	1	a	Old but Gold
2795	1	a	If you pick up this game now, you will most probably get wrecked by people who have mastered the game. Just a warning. Bloody good game though.
1867	1	a	The reason why you should be using Steam in the first place.
2088	1	a	10/10
777	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2010 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.
2362	0	a	IMHO this engine should be end on single player.
3225	1	a	Classic. Probably the best CS.
2460	0	a	havnt played it a lot but source is good
1120	1	a	:)
2125	1	a	Fired at a person and I actually killed them  10/10, already more polished than CSGO
1776	1	a	Love it
815	1	a	Still one of the best games after all these years :D
2105	1	a	i love the game just one question, why did valve change the old models? heres the problem the guys hand model in the beta is fine but the steam 1.6 version his skin is to pale to be skin. the old player models were fine but in 1.6 they are just blah. the old title screen it looked fine in the beta it always reminded me of the map de_dust but 1.6 it reminds me of like a news report thing about to come on TV. the hostages sure they look better with the bland orange suits and the white suits with ties, but the scientist models for the hostages look better because for example would you see a guy in a orange suit in a freezing cold place like office? alright i think i am done with saying all the problems with cs 1.6 now
4934	1	a	What a GAME!!
316	1	a	Counter-Strike is a great game, from this game have 5 stars, really congrats to VALVe for make this amazing game.
3432	1	a	THE BEST GAME FOREVER !
3559	1	a	the best shooting game ever
1788	1	a	I got killed by a team of mexicans, russians, 40 year olds, and one asian. 10/10
3215	1	a	BEST GAME EVER MADE, with the exception of previous versions like 1.5. I've been playing this game since internet cafes were prevalent and I STILL can't get enough.
1977	1	a	Awesome game spent more than 2000 hours totally
2999	1	a	So good 10/10. Played this game when i was ten. IST MAGNIFICENTLY!!!!!!
4902	1	a	Booring Switch To Go :D
1823	1	a	must have game. If you don't believe me try it for yourself!
20	1	a	10/10 Would get 'Fire in the hole' tattooed on my â¥â¥â¥.  Again.
3009	1	a	That is so good :) !
438	1	a	The year is 1987.........................................  ut's time to fight back
3010	1	a	A timeless classic. This game got me started on steam. I wasted many non-recorded hours of my life on this game. The buggy vehicles are the most fun vehicles I've ever played with in any game ever. I can't believe they left vehicles out of the source engine games. I also miss nipper maps and the community surrounding them.
124	1	a	What a greade game had real good times whit this
4955	1	a	this game is awesome
249	1	a	I like this game very much and.. LOVE IT .. :D In this game i liked strategy, team work and competitions, in specially i like to play with people, with friends:)

4481	1	a	The original recipe of counter strike. Play it or Die!
218	1	a	It is a very good, classic game, which started the multiplayer shooter game series of Counter Strike.
548	1	a	Old but gold!
4709	1	a	:)
1289	1	a	Play Hard Play fair Go Pro
2491	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
608	1	a	Best game, will last forever !
3363	1	a	That moment of pure passion when your enemy's lifeless body slumps to the ground, and to the top-right of the screen you see your name and feel your score increase.  You might have played this game for 50 hours, or you might have played it for 5,000; but it doesn't matter how experienced you are, because it's all about that moment.
3942	1	a	BEST GAME!!
3085	1	a	I've been playing CS Source and GO for a while now, I bought the valve pack and thought it'd be fun the play those games since i've always been a Half-Life fan. I've played it when i was younger, and it brings back memories.  The game is really nice, still to this day. I love playing new maps, do scrims and have fun with my Competitive team.  Would recommend! Although most servers are Spanish, it's still fun if you don't know the language.
4080	1	a	If your reading this, that means you have a steam account. Which means there's no reason you shouldn't have this game in your library already.   Btw dont waste your time with CS Zero
1854	1	a	1.6 was a revolutionary shooter inspired by some of the greats like Team Fortress Classic. There's a reason why Counter Strike is practically a house-hold name now, and why it's one of the most popular multiplayer games. Because it's a powerhouse of effective design and balance.
3527	1	a	bEST OF THE bEST
3238	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing neopets is better then this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
2913	1	a	Cool
4408	1	a	You can also play ping only at the beginning of a great
3721	1	a	Awesome game brings back memories i rate this 10/10
1881	1	a	+1
157	1	a	CS1.6 indeed the best multiplayer game in the FPS world. I have literally grown up playing this game and still have not got bored having played it for over 10 years now.
3826	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6 what an awsome game! This is so nostalgic! If you are looking for better graphics go for Counter-Strike - Global Offensive.  10/10 (for the nostalgic)
2875	1	a	!
3431	1	a	full of indonesians and the wallbang is just so realistic 10/10
3512	1	a	best game in the world :3
3936	1	a	...
4006	1	a	Old School if you see what i mean :)
5219	1	a	After so many years still the best fps ever made 10/10
1503	1	a	Old school first person shooter. Great game, no doubt.
3939	1	a	Old school pew pew pew.
4939	1	a	Still the most epic game ever created. Yes CS:GO is great, and is a definite CS reviver, BUT, 1.6 will forever be the game that ruined our lives!  Commited thousands of hours to 1.6, 1.5 and all previous iterations. Started way way back when it was still a mod for HL1. Growing up and watching the game grow and turn into what it has become has been a truly great experience.  This game is still alive, and you can still have hundreds of hours of fun on it, so give it a go :)
5083	1	a	The Game Number One on Line!!! excelent game despite having many years continue being  the best game of accion and estrategy.
2565	0	a	well i know its old school BUT no
2531	0	a	This game sucks cant hit â¥â¥â¥â¥
2736	1	a	Just a fun old school game
4678	1	a	Counter Strike is one of the best first person shooter in the whole world, its so funny to play hns and other gamemodes! Yes i recommend this awesome game! 10/10 little cats!
510	1	a	Still the best.

5021	1	a	very nice shooter game and nice work gaben
2816	1	a	Aah memories, definately recommend this game!
1657	1	a	Cs 1.6 ... That Game!

3641	1	a	the classic
3816	1	a	Old but gold!  This game was the best experience in my past. It won many awards and was the world number one in online gaming. I played it over ten years in many clans and 5on5 teams, in few leagues and many cups.  My best experience was the 6 months in Electronic Sports League Pro Series 2005 and in Electronic Sports League World Cyber Games 2005 Qualifiers.  This old game never had so many cheaters and players under 13 as the new one Counter-Strike: Global Offensive...  I miss the gold old time!
4574	1	a	Perfect
3118	1	a	recomand !
132	1	a	This game is the Game of the Millenium...It's the only game that is played from 2000 to today. Every PC is capable to play this game, even the one that didn't got their driver updated on 2003(Probably). So yeah, if you are a fan of old-school, this game is for ya'.
3197	1	a	The mother of all FPS The gameplay is so perfect giving the player the whole control over the character's movement at all times that it tests the players skills. It's a perfect example of a game which is easy to learn but hard to master
2688	1	a	LIke this game !

5253	1	a	Since 1.4 this game was the best FPS! Now the engine was replaced by CS GO!
5218	1	a	Great game, one of my favourite games ever. This game and Quake III Arena are masterpieces of the online FPS genre.
1979	1	a	100,000,000,000 Times better than csgo, cancer is almost non existant in this game, everyone is friendly, if ESEA, ESL or CEVO still had a pug / scrim service for this I would uninstall cancer strike : p90 offensive in a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing heartbeat and play some proper counter strike!
2342	1	a	When-ever I want to have a break off counter strike : Global offensive, I play this game! ^_^

1587	1	a	This game is so competitive. This sport takes $15 bucks to play but if you want to play the game properly it'll take 16 years to master, this is the one stop shop for the PC Master Race when looking for a Multi-Player First Person Shooters.
649	1	a	Exciting game and wonderful .

2866	1	a	Kreedz for life yo
4412	1	a	Classic CS (Counter-Strike) never gets old, Ka_ maps were the best game type for me, loved round after round dodging blade swings and countering with a sweet headshot, no game mode more tense than Knife Arena, getting stormed at by several opposing team members hungry for frags, using all skill and wit at a 5:1 ratio and coming out victor.. EPIC!
4813	1	a	March, 1998... Two iconic games released.. FOR SOME REASON THIS ONE IS STILL FUN... O.O
1983	1	a	  .
1261	1	a	Best FPS ever made for gamers with brain and good dexterity!
101	1	a	I've been playing this game for 10 years (7 or 8 years on non-steam), and it still amazes me with the fact that people are still playing this game.   Met bunch of amazing people, learned english more than what school has taught me, joined and left great community every now and then; this game has a huge impact on my life, from personality to the way I see the world (not exaggerating).  Some people claimed they have slept with my family, some claimed they are not a hacker (while their crosshair moves furiously, claiming it was an earthquake), some other claimed they can play better if their ping was lower and some other claimed they have tracked my IP and are on the way to kill me. What a super friendly community.  Best multiplayer fps game in the history of mankind, never gets me bored with tons of user-made mod, and one thing that this game never cease to amaze me is the fact that this game has a better hitbox than CS:GO (come at me CS:GO plebs)  1.6/Counter-Strike, would get rekt by a player playing in the earthquake again
1333	1	a	Most popular game for low computers!
5053	1	a	This game may seem 'stupid' to some people, becasue of the graphis. This game is exactly like CSGO and the only difference is the graphics. Otherwise, everything is the same thing (excluding camos).
4342	1	a	Still good after all these years
941	1	a	A never ending and amazing game...!!!!!!!!!!!
3013	1	a	It's an awesome game.I wish for a long time to buy it on steam and finally I did it.And now I am enjoy it.I have more possibilities and more 'doors opend'

59	1	a	This game is just amaizing. If you have a game with cheaters then change the server with admins that actualy do stuff right like cs.kopideja.lv  Yes The graphics are outdated and the physix may make no sense but this is what started it all... If you havent played this and you play other CS games then you know nothing about this game...

1199	1	a	Best Game I Have Ever Played
2056	1	a	Despite my hilariously low count of, 0.6 hours, on record, I can attest to you that, nay, I have played this game(and it's 'sequels') to the ends of time. I've literally sunk close to 15,000 hours into the various derivations of CS over the years.  I found out about CS from some #IRC chat I used to frequent back in the day(it might have been an ICQ chat with one of them). Namely, I started with the first ALPHA(yea, not beta, ALPHA). I can recall the loading screen and everything. From there, I progressed through the initial betas, introduction of maps, and various weapons(anyone remember the OLD cs_siege, complete with working apc and sniper tower?), etc.  I then became a player in various 'leagues'; I won't name drop, but I was a baller at one time.  So, yes, this game is good. Some people recommend CSGO as the 'modern' return of 1.6, but I disagree. CSGO is better than CSS, yes, but still not on-par with 1.6, nothing will ever be :(  Goodbye WON-servers.
5244	1	a	better than CSGO
4028	1	a	:)
2817	1	a	This is Counter Strike 1.6 Recomanded !
1107	1	a	Classic old school game. Still worth it! One of the first and classic FPS games EVER! I highly recommend it and even after at least 15 years there is a playerbase of over 15 000 people. 10/10.
4667	1	a	the original fire in the hole
3158	1	a	One of the best first person game
1248	1	a	Yes , worth it !
2114	1	a	Classic great game, if you have not played it you should!
4640	1	a	Bralgh
331	1	a	Black Screen... 11/10 Would buy again!
2085	1	a	Like it, in my opinium the best CS, now i can play it cause they fixed the hacked masterserver.
365	1	a	This is my all time favourite game. It is one of the first game I played. This game has been with me until now and I am still playing it with a big joy. It may be old but there is no other game that can replace it in my life.
3132	1	a	not as awful as the other ones
1789	1	a	.
2041	1	a	Great Game
4544	1	a	Officially endorsed by Seung-Hui ChoÂ©
4603	1	a	The best fps ever made!
1551	1	a	A true revolution in first person shooters. A feat of engineering. Masterpiece in art. Simple yet in every way functional. Something which has embedded itself in even the oldest adn dustiest of HDD's. A creation unerasable by even the gods themselves
2927	1	a	that's classic

4882	1	a	Good'ol Counter-Strike
5101	1	a	Go CSGO, I own cs 1.6, go is better the css, and 1.6, cs 1.6 can help alot understanding the 2 other main valve games, css, csgo.
4054	1	a	Pretty much the best game ever. period.
5234	1	a	This game will never get old!
2605	1	a	This Is the best game I've ever play.... :)
2281	0	a	my game is so broken, and so stupidly made (i cannot do anything in) all time reconekt and spit out!!! May i cnow the reason for it?
51	1	a	While people are outside playing Pokemon GO I'm playing a real game.
1992	1	a	even my mom plays this game
2558	0	a	This was one of the best first person shooter and fps games. After steam updated the fpsengine and made other changes to the game after more than 10 years of good gameplay, I would rather say that this is a now a rip-off. The game doesn't work properly and the developers isn't listening to the players when they're updating the game.   If steam would roll back the game to before they update I would recommend this game because of the good gameplay. At the moment because of the update I just want my money back!
1915	1	a	Very fun game, It's a classic and the only reason I use steam in the first place. If you're a fan of the series pick this up now.
4417	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldnât find the stupid cake.
4405	1	a	the best
522	1	a	YES, long live counter strike 1.6 - the best game ever.
421	1	a	A game that never gets old! &lt;3
3124	1	a	Ahh... Good old times.
3387	1	a	Classic game.
3445	1	a	dont run crack programs you can get vac band i got sow i know
1811	1	a	Very good game !
2097	1	a	#Old But Gold  #Best Shooter Ever
503	1	a	Legendary game.
1182	1	a	My favourite game. At leats 6000 hours.
4466	1	a	In the beginning, there was Counter-strike. Classic tactical team-based shooter.
864	1	a	was gut game
2442	0	a	I thought I would receive comfy nostalgia with a small but nice community, instead I got a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥-talking mexicans 14/88 it's not like you think it would be
2576	0	a	oldschooll...
4663	1	a	I grow up on CS 1.6, but now it is unplayable. a lot of garbage on servers a lot of music and useless things. low download speed, and everybody hack everywhere. Please make something with this game, just need some patch, for disable downloadable contetn, and useless things...
843	1	a	the best game forever.
1011	1	a	After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can't be ignored. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular.
3672	1	a	This is in my opinion one of the best games ever to exist in history of video games. This game is balanced as â¥â¥â¥â¥ compared to cs go. This game is a lot more fun and requires skill and dedication and not luck. 10 / 10 This game gave birth to legends we got today such as GeT_RiGhT, F0rest and Neo!
2960	1	a	.
2113	1	a	The original Counter-Strike, Valve made a multiplayer masterpiece here; it is almost faultless, apart from its old graphics.  14/15 - 'Good'

614	1	a	best game they ever made
4515	1	a	Hellio guys plz help me when i am run Counter Strike it works fine i see ct then the black screen show's up and Half life ahs stopped working :/ plz help me
1986	1	a	my bread and butter
1948	1	a	Is very good game, i play it for a long time.
3136	1	a	It's a classic!
2049	1	a	Best shooter of all time. It is old but so much people are still playing it. You need skill and good reflexes... and do not camp or snipe... because I will knive a n00b!
3441	1	a	The classic that set an entire subgenre of FPS games. I played the beta, and played that for YEARS before buying and installing 1.6. That's when I first got my Steam account. Then I got CS:Source. Then, it was others. Thirty games later, I still love the original CS. I was a member of 76th AD on Day of Defeat, and I regularly hung out on Vir's Pub in Vancouver long after the release of CS:S. There's a reason this game has more hours logged than any other for me (over 1400 hours, at last check); it never gets old. I sometimes have to remember to buy ammo, since CS:S tied ammo to the weapon, but this game was truly my first love in the FPS genre.  Seriously, just get it. It's always good to have the classic. And seriouslyâI only play CS and CS:S in the series; CS:GO's pay-to-win system is not what I look for in a game. Bide your time, build up your funds, and then unleash the fury. It's that simple. No, I'm not good enough to do pro gaming. I'm not even really good enough to make it on the amateur circuit. But I did get good enough to be an even match to my friendsâ¦ all without paying for deus ex machina.   I don't play WoW for similar reasons: I refuse to pay a monthly fee to play a game. Yes, there are free (libre) servers out there. My stepson runs one. But the point is that if I buy the license to the game, I should be able to play all I want without having to pay a fee. Pay-to-win is arguably worse than pay-to-play; it creates an unbalanced play experience, and I refuse to participate in that.   Bearing that in mind, that's why I love CS and CS:S. It's just you, your skill, and an adversarial challenge. There's no buying your way to victory. I hope Valve can get back to that in future releases.
663	1	a	Classic :D
2028	1	a	I love this game. That was the first game where i was start and i love it forever &lt;3
4236	1	a	Throwing grenade in doors will open 'em  10/10 for realistic experiance
5125	1	a	.
3142	1	a	This game is a bit old, sure, but it was revolutionary back in its day. The first time I played this, I was hooked - both into Counter-Strike, and Steam as a whole. I love the simple yet complicated game-play. Brilliant, fast-paced multi-player action, with also single-player (and co-op) missions for Counter-Strike: Zero lets you experience quite a rush. If you enjoy this title, be sure to pick up the later CS titles, too; Global Offensive and Source. Definitely recommend this to everyone, both young and old, new and experienced.
1490	1	a	Counter-Strike, Gta 3 and Age of Empires 1 are first games that i played on my first pc. I still own all three of them on original cd and til this day i occasionally play them. They bring back some good old memories when i was a kid :)
3427	1	a	After countlessly playing CSGO, Counter Strike original called me for no odd reason. I decided to buy it and wow, the game does lack graphics and resolution, but brings so much memories to almost 4-5 years ago! It's a classic. I hope they could remaster or somehow bring back Counter Strike original so its graphics do get improved and see how different they both looked from year 2000 till today   11/10 :D awesome game, brining back heaps of memories.
379	1	a	A briliant FPS game. Fast Paced Action. Skill Required = Good FPS
4738	1	a	The best multiplayer game
5193	1	a	Simple, BRILLIANT ! Love this
617	1	a	It's been 12 years since I have played this game and having just reinstalled it I remember why it was my most played game. Doesn't get old. I hope people continue to play this for another 12 years!
2138	1	a	always will be the best game ever
2530	0	a	Won the game in less than an hour. 10/10
4057	1	a	Still the master of all tactical shooters out there! &lt;3
2129	1	a	10 years of pure fun &lt;3 10/10
3855	1	a	Old memories :*(
2128	1	a	still better than cod
1553	1	a	16 years old and over double the players playing at once than the newest CoD. That should tell you something
3254	1	a	4/5
102	1	a	Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux.   Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams that include counter-terrorists and terrorists. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else killing all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.

603	1	a	Old but very good.. still a lot of people playing the best FPS ever.. Still the most played in the world.
4730	1	a	Beast.
272	1	a	The classic action FPS: Counter-Strike, has made a huge impact on my gaming life, ever since I was a pre-pubscent,6 year old child. Enjoying various betas and versions throughout it's development, the game has evolved from a mod for Half-Life, to one of the most viewed and played eSports.   If you haven't already, buy it,play it and enjoy it. I have nailed countless of hours on different accounts I've had, and of course the non-steam versions  10/10
1450	1	a	hope you payed attention is spanish class â¥â¥â¥â¥face because english is no longer spoken here  fun tho
4924	1	a	Nice game!

406	1	a	After 16 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayer games in the world. it's one of the best shouter games ever made !! you can't get bored of this one, trust me i have about 1.3k hours here on steam &amp; more than 2k on the non steam version =) but ppl left it to play 'modern games' like cs go &amp; battlefield &amp; COD .. what a shame !! there still some alive communities &amp; servers so don't be afraid ... but the sad thing is that there are many cheaters (you will get used to see them anyways, thank god there are many admins who can take care of them) i love this game so much but after all maybe this it's the right time to let it go. maybe one day i will comeback to find it alive again like the old days, maybe one day :) anyways, i totally recommend this game for everyone! don't be shy go buy it now if you didn't already do !' this is a must have one !'
3283	1	a	I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10
1798	1	a	This is a great game :D
842	1	a	Still better than any other Call of Duty.
2959	1	a	Legendary Game. Nothing more to say xD
2658	1	a	The game may be old, but it still gives hours of fun.
3475	1	a	- Joins a game - Gets tons of kills - Checks scoreboard - 50 kills and 2 deaths  10/10, would get a 25.0 KDR again.
3244	1	a	:*
1363	1	a	Nostalgia Nostalgia! There is no nostalgia in that it sets good to have this life counter strike!
4702	1	a	Best Game I eveR playeD..
1845	1	a	For the people that believed that Counter-Strike Global Offensive was too easy, I present to you this title.
2142	1	a	old one are the best,
3171	1	a	:* this game
3012	1	a	The first FPS/Game I played on PC and to be honest those years playing CS1.6 (5+years) were simply AMAZING !  At the time the gameplay was perfect ! the game was really easy to handle and understand, the graphisme ? When it came out it was really good and enough, then the game never grew up and we never had patchs / new versions. But it was still fine as long as we could all developpe our skill and create new strats.  We got a lot of mods like zombie deathmatch gungame jail and for me the best mods Hide'N'Seek, Kz, Deathrun etc...  To be honest those years were truly a pleasure to play.  Thank you so much to create a game like that.  Without counting that now we have new versions and eSport is growing everyday!
1550	1	a	This game was nearly the first one I have ever played and still is in top 10. Don't be surprised that I have so little hours played onto my account, becouse I am still playing onto my half-life version with official cd-key.(played like 1000+ hours). This game is totally worth buying if you like playing in cooperation with friends. 2 team are tying to kill each other with one life. Point is: Terrorists are supposed to destroy a bombsite and Counter Terrorists are supposed to defend it. It works the same in hostage rescue, CT has to take hostages to safety. But if you are looking for a counter strike and good graphics, don't look here. Try CS:Source or Global Offensive.
3788	1	a	Since starting this game in 2000, it's hands down my idea for the best game of all time.
2243	1	a	10/10
771	1	a	Best shooter ever!

4846	1	a	Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $30 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.   Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.   There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.   CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.   It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.   Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.   As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.   Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!   In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!

3671	1	a	Absolutely one of the best fps games i've played. People still talk that CS 1.6 (Counter Strike) died, it is a lie: it still standing up. Of course, is not a swarm of people who still play, but some still play the game.

1517	1	a	i dont know any game better than this...
4159	1	a	Game that makes you skilled.
4093	1	a	Very cool game. Lately the book club has been trying to learn to communicate with Mexicans and Spanish people so this game really opened a new world for us, letting us dive into the daily lives of a Mexicano and their struggles in the virtual world of Counter Strike. I will be recommending this to my book club and spanish class.
767	1	a	Probably the best game of all time !!!
3043	1	a	Never too old to play CS :)

1686	1	a	cool game bra
430	1	a	After years, it`s still very fun to play with friends.
1879	1	a	Best FPS out there, no doubt. With so many different mods, maps and time it takes to get bored with this game, I just can't think of a better FPS game. Best of all, it's all fun usually - except when you get kicked from a lithuanian/polish server for speaking english or asking to ban a wallhacker.  9/10  ...because server list is so big and many of the servers are full of bots, only serving purpose to redirect players to join someone elses server. It can be hard to find a real server.
3795	1	a	Can't believe I'm still playing this, even after 15 years !
2159	1	a	Very nice, people may disagreee because of its graphics but come on!  it doesn't matter.  :D
4061	1	a	So addictive, an all-time great.
861	1	a	Do you recommend this game?  YESH !
3628	1	a	Old But Good =D I Like It
2453	0	a	weird and clunky. all servers are mexican.
4981	1	a	Even if this game is old, it's pretty amazing and fun. Some mods kinda suck, but classic remains the best.
4281	1	a	One of the best FPS game.. Every FPS gamer needs to try this game !
2984	1	a	probably would be better if the playerbase was actually â¥â¥â¥â¥ing english
4084	1	a	What can I say about it ? It was my first love, we spent countless together... This game is for sure the best game of all the time!!!! It's been 13 years since the first headshot, and still got the same excitation!!!!! 
3511	1	a	Nice and a good game for graphics.
2476	0	a	i dont know is it ebcause i didnt play it when it was first out but to me it seems â¥â¥â¥â¥ theres no competive mode and the graphics arent good either gameplay is good but id just get global offensive
4147	1	a	Buy CS:GO instead of this  its a good game tho
4489	1	a	The one of my favourite games of all time i played it since 2000 so it was a lot of fun for me to play if u dont have it buy it now!!  Ruined my social life too 11/10
942	1	a	I love this shooting game, even it is an old game.
3151	1	a	123
3237	1	a	i was told to be done with it through  Closed shutters, flooded floors, i wanted to sail out the front door.  morning anew I'm counting the texts you sent me  I'm trying hard to take this well, but the cradle has been rocked and my feelings are a stir.  and I'm not really sure how to approach this landing despair  and so many eyes on me, i felt like commiting suicide  open the door, 40mph, dead forever more  and so little time, we we kids just exploring,  trying to find a way out of this surburban story   And that my friends is an Emo song straight out of the state of New Jersey. Taking back sunday? Thursday? Pffftt this is way more garbage tier than that.
1262	1	a	CS is a must have for every Steam player.
4293	1	a	Who can not love the good old classic Counter-Strike? I played this â¥â¥â¥â¥ religiously when I was younger, had some good times. The game has gotten pretty outdated, and there's large traces of hacker â¥â¥â¥â¥s. Regardless, still a monumentally epic game.
644	1	a	This isnt a bad game. I played this game when i was young and learned playing this game with friends.
2013	1	a	if you like old shooters then this game is for you 
452	1	a	It's cs1.6 and your on Steam, if you don't have this then please follow these steps:  1. Uninstall Steam. 2. Kill yourself.
1374	1	a	this game was the â¥â¥â¥â¥ its the â¥â¥â¥â¥, dont â¥â¥â¥â¥ with this â¥â¥â¥â¥ cos this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ suprerior to your â¥â¥â¥â¥

4062	1	a	Man Simply Awesome Game &lt;33333333333
3862	1	a	Review (or update your review) for a game you've nominated (Steam awards 2016)
209	1	a	Classic FPS.
490	1	a	:)
380	1	a	This is the game that started a genre, every shooter since CS has copied its competitive team-based style of play. Its the original to a legacy, and many people still play it to this day. It has older graphics for people who might not have an expensive computer, plenty of dedicated servers, and the core gameplay that is known worldwide is right here where it belongs.  But obviously you know this already unless you've been spending your life playing on Xbox and playstation. Right?
2811	1	a	the best game ever
3267	1	a	Reminds me of old school gaming
3784	1	a	5/7
2136	1	a	The best game ever!!&lt;3
5260	1	a	Great game. Best in Steam series cs games. Wish valve would go back to 1.5 days
4881	1	a	Very nice game
1955	1	a	good game, played this since 03 &lt;3
1925	1	a	The Best
895	1	a	A fantastic game that improves your fluency in the foreign languages. Every server you visit has the charming alure of Mexicans and Brazillians; an honorable bunch of players who praise your skills with phrases such as 'filho da â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!!', 'xiter!!!' and 'jajajajaja'. They are also very skilled players ingame; I often see a single player moving at the speed of sound, headshotting everyone in a blink of an eye, and getting all the praise from his fellow brethren, usually in the form of 'xiter fdp!!!'. Overall, I recommend this game to all individuals seeking to have a fun, non-hacker, non-english gameplay experience.
1375	1	a	Great game.
853	1	a	i remember this game
1624	1	a	If you didn't play this but play CS:GO, you probably like to pretend you did.
2514	0	a	Never Play This Game Ever Period End Of Story.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
3590	0	a	People still play this game? I was forced to buy it due to ex g/f. She was actually a professional, as in got paid, counter-strike player.
3580	1	a	Counter-Strike is the best competitve game ever made. Thanks to CS, I traveled many countries around the world and competed against the best players.
2578	0	a	VOLVO DELETE THIS GAME PLS!!!!!!! THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥EST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED
1632	1	a	:)))))))))))
2053	1	a	I remember when i played this game in2005 it was so cool at this time but now..
29	1	a	This game is unlike the other counter strike games. This game requires a different type of skill. You have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. You also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. I personally think this is the best counter-strike game.
4929	1	a	10/10
3232	1	a	I missed this game. This is the best game of all time!
1849	1	a	Of course, very good game, only writing this to increase amount of positive reviews.
4556	1	a	one of the alltime CLASSICS. the only reason we have steam. still a damn fine game. looks like â¥â¥â¥ nowadays but still hella fun. recommended.
3902	1	a	Very Addictive to this Game. Like to play with my friends. I enjoy this game a lot.
3544	1	a	Joined random server.  Got rekt by old cs players.  Looks online for tips and tricks.  Couldn't find any and still sucks.  10/10 would get rekt again. RIP :(
1200	1	a	Almost 3000h played, still paying!  Best â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game ever, â¥â¥â¥â¥ go :)
3491	1	a	First game=Death Second game=Death Third Game=I suck at this game.
2546	0	a	This reboot of the series fell flat just go back to CS:GO
1786	1	a	shoot at body = nothing  shoot at head = dead before bullets hit
3294	1	a	Good but kind of old
3242	1	a	addictive
3933	1	a	Old school FPS. The one that started it all when it comes to modern shooters. Still fun, fluid game play. I cut my teeth playing CS, my first fps game I played. Takes a bit more skill. Many, many good times!
1403	1	a	If you did not play it yet , you still did not feel the taste of GAMES !!
3376	1	a	Better than CS:GO .
3710	1	a	One of the best game ever made.
4183	1	a	Well I guess since I have 117 hours clocked into this game *cough cough* steam bug *cough cough* I am obligated to write a review for this game. So this game is most definetly timeless as it is basically super smash bros melee to Counter-Strike:Source/Counter-Strike Global Offensive's super smash bros brawl. This game is unique as when you die you don't respawn until the next round meaning that your team can lose by having all of it's members die. As well, you need to buy your weapons or take them from the bodies of your enemies instead of just finding them scattered across the battlefield like other games of it's time did. Today the game can seem a bit outdated with a lack of ragdoll physics making aerial deaths look weird and unnatural as well as the obvious outdated graphics which can be 'fixed' with a hd patch that just looks weird and unnatural compaired to games made at the time of the patch's creation (2003). Overall I would recommend this game if you buy the retail copy or if they fixed the bug that is the only reason why I have logged 117 hours into the game.
1597	1	a	Can't find any people who speak english. That's okay, because I'm Osama.

3329	1	a	Great game...I probably.. ya i have about 20k hours in this game. they didnt start counting hours until 2009 so ive been playing since 2000... I played alot of leagues during this era. Been called a hacker more than 1000000 times... Times has changed so time to move onto csgo... If you dont have a mic dont play this if you dont have common sense dont play this if you are hard of hearing dont play this game if you have lack of teamwork, dont play if you dont want to spend 1000s of hours on learning how to play the game.. dont play. takes years and years to become even half way decent...  10/10 would play this all over again from the start of cs.  Now since its 2015.. the game is still alive sorta.. just get csgo and good luck on ur adventure. hope all the best.

1001	1	a	Great Game &lt;3
696	1	a	I went from CS:GO to this after 1K Hours on CS:GO and I still think this game is gorgeous. I'm really sad that I started to play 1.6 just now, and also that I missed the 1.6 golden era. Even if the physics and almost everything else is really different and 'strange' I find it more relaxing to play but at the same time harder then GO. A lot of players don't even know about this game, but people listen me! If you love CS in general you have to play this game at least once and please don't crack it...you'll find only russians on that versions and everybody knows how they play at CS ;)
3964	1	a	my favorit game!
2099	1	a	Tons of fun, but there's a couple newer versions now.
2681	1	a	BEST GAME !
3612	1	a	Classic Half-Life MOD...
2445	0	a	still sucks after 15 years
4537	1	a	Awesome game 2358 Hours :P
1140	1	a	easy game for relaxation
1425	1	a	this is perhaps the first game that I play on PC
4773	1	a	*Enter server* *Killing a child (admin)* *Get permanent banned* Nailed it.  10/10 Gr8 m8 i r8 8/8.
4484	1	a	Very good game ! Best ! :)
4413	1	a	The team based multiplayer FPS game that started it all, in my opinion. Classic game.
4520	1	a	Nice Gamer
1734	1	a	This is a game I've played with friends ever since I was very young, so it means a lot to me. It is the definition of classic games and fun to play with just friends where nobody is extremely good and everyone just have fun.
217	1	a	:)
2563	0	a	Outdated graphics, and my bullets wont hit ever except when im really close. Why would anyone buy this when there are free games like battlefield:heroes that have better graphics and control better. Also, the amount of hacking in this game is tremendous, i join a server and about 30% of the people playing are using some form of hacx. The biggest rip-of off my life.
2991	1	a	Join the best and classic shooter game.
1613	1	a	Better than CS:GO for sure
2775	1	a	Jumped into a game, got shot, respawned got shot, respawned got shot. Although this happened i probably should of looked at controls and realised i could buy other guns and stuff. still a good game 6/10
4796	1	a	Well I can Remember standing in line for this game on day 1. it was on a cd and this is well before steam was invented.  you had to install the retail patches yourself back then it was a pain. thank goodness they brought out steam hey. anyway this was my first online game I ever played and I've not stopped since. I still play counter strike to this day 15 years later but im on csgo nowadays. this game lost me my girlfriend so thanks valve haha   overall amazing game 10/10
4964	1	a	nice, what'eva!
2153	1	a	Although it has poor animations and graphics, it is still one of the most played games, and it's still running. This game is created to test out players reflexes. With great skills, comes great VICTORIES.  Put your skills to the test with this Counter Strike, one of the best first player shooting game ever released, with more than 1000 of servers online 24/7.
3107	1	a	i love this game but now iam going to cs.go bay cs

3543	1	a	Literally the best game of all time. Needs a ban wave of hackers to clean up the game.
545	1	a	Nice game!
4244	1	a	Classic superb multyplayer game, But till STEAM the hot air is out. Is it the servers? the players? The stupid fan-mods? I donÂ´t know....

3971	1	a	Classic. Very well made game
27	1	a	This game will never get old &lt;3
2174	1	a	  Whats 
2341	0	a	I like old games, I mean, i grew up playing the Lands Of lore RPG's. This game was awesome when it came out for its time..but i like to move on with the times and experience newer, better games. I want to push my rig, and going back to a game from 2000, wont be doing much for me. I can understand why alot of people have trouble letting go of the past, and playing all the games they did when PC gaming started to become more relivent, but common, there are so many better looking, newer games out there that people dont give a chance. Even CSGO needs a buff,graphically and mechanically but thats just me.
945	1	a	Favorite game ever to chill out and veg on
1963	1	a	10/10

1328	1	a	Awesome game. First FPS I ever got good at and still to this day I can load it up and have fun playing this game. This game has a lot of history behind it and it probably the foundation for a lot of the new FPS most notably CoD(Call of Duty). Thanks to this game I learned how to play an FPS properly and will alway enjoy playing this game no matter how old it is!
4384	1	a	This is the best game ever!!
4265	1	a	The Granddaddy of all FPS Multiplayer Games, CS is unapolgetic and based on skill alone! Its a game that not afraid make you feel like you really suck.....but you keep coming back for more everytime!
4874	1	a	It is the Still World's No1 Best Multiplayer Game! Love it!

2700	1	a	Best game ever played!
2293	1	a	'Worst game ever, worst graphics' The graphics are that bad because the game is older than your mothers fanny and the game is awesome itself. Brings all the good memories back. For example when I was 7, installing the cracked version of that game and then just shooting anyone who gets in my way without controlling the recoil. (â¯Â°â¡Â°ï¼â¯ï¸µ â»ââ» and lol traded this game for some crappy AK-47 in CS GO. Huehuehuehuehue. I give it 8/8 m8. pls liek no hate no homo tenks. Oh and btw the funniest thing about this game is brining your CS GO skills there, doing 1 hit kills and then getting banned from servers for 'hacking' Like I've joined a sever once, done 7 headshots in a row without dying, then some speccy â¥â¥â¥â¥ is sayin': 'wh and aim off or im banning you.' So yea this game is fabulous 8/8 would rate again.
2824	1	a	Play the game.
4121	1	a	i Recommend this game because is the besssssst game evaaaaa|
5063	1	a	This game is immortal! She will never forget.

5222	1	a	The most awesome shooter game of all time .

2463	0	a	From this game i remember the good memories . I don't like good memories 
4585	1	a	Legend ..... wait for it ...... dary !
1804	1	a	Just one thing i would like to say is that i can live without my girl friend but not without counter strike. :) ;)
4769	1	a	Decent game with low price!
2985	1	a	The Best
1973	1	a	I bought a gun, killed some terrorists while spamming 'Fire in the Hole' and 'Cover me', and defused a bomb somewhere.  When I got home (after 10 years of service) , I played some Counter Strike.  Good game.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Please rate this up. I am poor and I need to buy more guns.
3665	1	a	!!!

3306	1	a	nostalgy everywhere but servers in my country is full of cheaters, so sad it's they lost btw i'm from bosnia
1536	1	a	An overwhelmingly great shooter. This game takes skill and tactics, and lots of teamwork. The community isnt perfect though. There are lots of dumb trashtalking players and people that whine whenever they die. If you can ignore that, then you will have an amazing experience.
3295	1	a	This game should be my first FPS game. Good old days... Good old friends.... All gone away
953	1	a	Cs 1.6 Only FOr Gamerz

2585	0	a	...................
2827	1	a	My favorite game #1
1312	1	a	The original Counter-Strike. The one who gave life to both CS:S and CS:GO. I first played this game when i was 7 (over 10 years ago) and i never forget how difficult it was for me to kill an enemy. However, this is great game and game that certainly belongs in the 'Top 10 Games of All Time'.
4529	1	a	nice game ever
3332	1	a	Coolest Game ever!
4647	1	a	really good game
5051	1	a	blah blah good game blah, this isnt where i parked my car?

4698	1	a	This game is a legend. Such a game will not be ever. It will never die, will live on forever! 
2178	1	a	Hands down best competitive shooter
4586	1	a	Game is really the best game
829	1	a	one game one love :D
3494	1	a	not my first time playing this game.. have been playing this for a long time now.. about 10 years atleast (was using non-steam cs) purchased this about a month ago and what can i say.. hasent changed a bit and now more fun is there.. :D highly recommended..
4032	1	a	It is one of the best games i've ever played.
495	1	a	old azz game, but still the best!

3477	1	a	The best game of my childhood. Love it.
3661	1	a	CS is love,CS is life. 
4200	1	a	The Classic Counter Strike , this is the old â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!
2766	1	a	Evergreen game .Still play it with friends
1783	1	a	NicE GamE !!! DragGes My TimE ANd SorrOW AwAy
2933	1	a	,
1046	1	a	It was the best game ever made before valve â¥â¥â¥â¥ it up!!!And yes i still hardly recommend this hardcore shooter!
3341	1	a	The best first person shooter of all time. 5/5
3226	1	a	The hand models, animations, weapon textures, and custom maps all make this game an enjoyable experience. Oh yeah but just add functional bots so I dont have to download â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Z-Bots, which, are not realistic in any way possible (aimbot, movement patterns, staring contests with enemies).  Although the game is a classic representation of how modernized tactical shooters should be produced, the hackers are always going to be there to ruin the fun. Also, some seriously dysfunctional hit detection occurs during most matches. Also, not trying to be too judgemental, but the game would have been a lot easier to play if the crosshairs had center dots. I say this because Source and G.O. have center crosshair dots, which make aiming much more persistent.   ***8.5/10***  Final Statement:  It's a damn ugly game, but that's what makes it good. Once modded, it can look like it runs on a completely different engine. However, the detail and missing physics are not present due to the limitations of GoldSrc's dated capabilities. Oh, and this game does not deserve to be ran with mods. Just simple and complex retextures of the weapons provided within the game. I would like to tell you that this game is better than Source and G.O., but half the community sticks to the newer iterations rather than the original.
3334	1	a	Best Game In the WORLD !!!
3622	1	a	Classic FPS!

5031	1	a	I've played it off and on for the past 8 years of my life. It is a true classic game. And it is still alive!! The multiplayer community is alive and thriving! You won't have to deal with annoying Russians (depending on if you actually pick a Russian server...) or 8 year old FPS kids. Pick this game up if you love classic, FPS action with an amazing community.

1530	1	a	The Retro feeling when playing this game just dosen't let me stop coming back to 1.6
3022	1	a	It hasn't aged that well, but it still holds a lot of nostalgia. It also lacks offline deathmatches with AI bots. Otherwise, it's a great game.   FINAL RATING: 82 out of 100
1000	1	a	Counter-Strike destroyed my life. I had been playing HL deathmatch, and was waiting for team fortress 2 (some of those early TF2 screens are still etched in my brain) I came across a new mod called Counter-Strike, it had just been released, Beta 1 there were only 3 maps I think and the player models were so similar that in the darkend corridors of Mansion you couldn't see who was what, so there was team killing galore, even a console command for extra money, but it was awesome, I'd never played anything like it. So I played it. ALLOT. I'd come in from college stick it on and play untill I was ready for bed, screw school work I had people to shoot in the face! Anyway I failed my A-levels and got stuck with crappy jobs, but looking back, it could possibly have been worth it, because damn I had fun! I don't know what its like nowadays, I did get fed up with the bunnyhopping AWP gits and from what I gather that is the way the game went, but this was it, where it started for me, and if you haven't played it once then you should just so you know where all your call of duty and all that balls came from.
2400	0	a	Very Old Game And Its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Graphic and ...
378	1	a	While starting to show its age, Counter-Strike is a classic that you just have to play!

4554	1	a	...
2619	1	a	Best game ever in the world
775	1	a	Even it's like 15 years old or more , it still leads the way for us , maybe not on classic modes , but for custom game-modes it's ... the perfect game , so many different ways to script plugins , ideas that attract people ... It may be underrated due to newer versions of CS , but as I said , you can't get the same , great and satisfying result in modding the game as in CS 1.6 . A great job , since 2000 :)
1662	1	a	Better than global offensive &lt;3
4013	1	a	always the best ! 
192	1	a	Best Action Game Ever!
2316	0	a	when I would go in and play. but when I arrived, all in giant zoomed know someone what to do to zoom out of the game. ???
3122	1	a	The Greatest Game Ever Created, My Childhood. I'll always have a spot in my heart for 1.6 If 1 review has every lead you to try a game, let this be the one, you're not a gamer until you've played Counter-Strike 1.6 PERIOD.
244	1	a	one of the best fps game!

1858	1	a	...
2171	1	a	Epic game Must try the old and vintage version of cs . :) Reminds my childhood. No matter cs new version are there but his will be evergreen. :) Must try
979	1	a	why needed to kill this game? it was and will be the best fps shooter ever, feel like CS:GO just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ...   i think the worst idea ever is the 'promod delete', thats a greatest game than Global :)   Im playing since 15 years, had 30+ lan event in Hungary, and i think just should have to use global achievement, LOUNGE (skins,trading,betting,etc..) and matchmaking functions, we have been a great geam what every counter player like, and want to play in any event...   the real counter strike will never die! and original half life engine is the best ever!
2134	1	a	I get my â¥â¥â¥ wooped by people who have been playing since electricity was discovered.
2215	1	a	So Classic :)
1358	1	a	Better than Source, better than GO.   But for some reason, people always prefer graphics over actual balanced gameplay.
4850	1	a	I am a CS:GO player, but i really enjoyed trying out the roots of the CS franchise!  Many active servers and players  And potentialy loads of fun!  Enjoy!
4528	1	a	Counter-Strike is an almost perfectly balanced mix of teamwork and individual skill with enough depth and nuance to inspire countless esports competitions.
3357	1	a	Good to tain aim=) Play first and secodn CS:GO!
5089	1	a	The beggining of the competitive FPS scene in gaming.

4693	1	a	Its Amazing!
2255	1	a	This is the only Counter-Strike game worth mentioning. 10/10 always and forever.
1672	1	a	It's the best starting point of all gamers.
3663	1	a	Where to begin? I was fortunate to be there at the beginning.   I downloaded Counter-Strike, the Half-Life mod, in August 1999 during Beta 3 after a kid at school recommended it. My group of friends fell in love.  Hostage and VIP missions were my preference, with Militia, 747 and Oilrig absolute favorites.   Sixteen years later, here I am, still playing the series. We may have left the first game behind, but the memories stay with me always.
33	1	a	Graphics is not everything! :) Old school love.
1004	1	a	legendary game
2386	0	a	Always hated Counter-Strike, got it as I got Half Life 1.
640	1	a	No r8 revolver, 10/10 will play again.

3430	1	a	Classic! :)
2416	0	a	the game just dissapeared

1862	1	a	To be honest, I started playing Counter-Strike: 1.6 when I was only 15, and today the game, I am 22 years old, yet I have not left the game, it is very hard even if it is old, still plays currently this CS 1.6 The best game in the world !!! 10/10 !!!

1260	1	a	Good Game, Appear Is The Best.

1429	1	a	The best game ever.
2058	1	a	A classic game, still good and played to this day, though I'm not pro enough to use the AWP

4180	1	a	Great game, most time plaing this :P
2647	1	a	I think this game is great. It is a old game so the graphics are not as good as some of the newer fps but it's a fun game. It's not a game you would play for hours day after day but it is great for playing when you get bored or to play now and then and i would recommend buying
4452	1	a	MEXICO'S favorite game este juego es realmente muy bueno Really, if you are considering getting this game, get it. Best CS game. 94/100
1839	1	a	Best Game of ALL the Time
4206	1	a	i remeber when this was a free Mod for half-life
3209	1	a	Counter strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential. You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought. I have NEVER enjoyed a game as much as i do with cs

1777	1	a	Hell yeah this is the holy grail of the FPS games! It takes quite a lot of time though to master this game and here, I'm talkin years. But totally worth it!
4910	1	a	...
330	1	a	Classic!
1257	1	a	Old but gold!
4279	1	a	Can't get much better than the original!!!!
3299	1	a	My life is Cs 1.6
1510	1	a	Classic.
4766	1	a	!!!!
246	1	a	Counter-Strike is the best first-person online shooting game. Because it depends only in your own skills. There are no advantages like in Call of Duty series, you will need to aim correctly, know the recoil of your gun and shoot your enemies to death.
3880	1	a	  It's good..
641	1	a	...
1606	1	a	i bought the counter-strike complete pack and i've never regreted buying it
1886	1	a	Oh Counter-Strike... If you don't have this game then where have you been the last 15 years -_- (Also it's my personal favorite FPS)
782	1	a	I just bought it recently in steam But I've been playing it since my childhood It was my first FPS Game  simply... THE BEST 10/10 &lt;3 XOXO
3790	1	a	The best game of history.
556	1	a	Best game of my life..
2727	1	a	Counter Strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential.  You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought.
309	1	a	Yes i recommend this game :D
4848	1	a	Oldschool is always the best!
1663	1	a	Played this since 2003, addictive game.
2392	0	a	  This is just a s.hitty unrealistic version of Call of Duty! Don't buy this c.rappy knock off, it looks like a f.ucking Iphone game.
283	1	a	Still fantastic after all these years. The game that molded a generation.
4916	1	a	The best FPS I have ever played. From the original beta versions in 1999 up untill version 1.6 I all love. Some more than others but the basic gameplay is just awesome.  It is highly addictive and frustration levels can rise to highest possible but the fun of teaming up and achieving the kills / goals is just a rush ;) Okay, the graphics are not the greatest anymore, but the fact that after all these years I still pick up the game and play it says enough for me.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FiGwvCZ1X0&amp;feature=related   Check it out! :P
2343	1	a	My old school tactical fps.Its still have a classic atmosfere and gameplay.My best game from 90s.
1929	1	a	very nice game
2867	1	a	This game is for nabs
3286	1	a	The classic genre-defining FPS. Counter-Strike may be 16 years old but there are thousands of servers with an overflowing amount of players. The difficulty curve is no joke. But once you get used to it, you never get tired of tea-bagging dead players after a headshot. Since it is only multiplayer, you get practically infinite replayability.  8/10 - A Big Heavy Dose of Fun
2244	1	a	This is the only Counter-Strike game worth mentioning. 10/10 always and forever.
1998	1	a	.
5113	1	a	cool this game :D and in VIP AND ADMIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3474	1	a	I would like to write a little review for this game and Express their personal opinion. We all know the most popular and everyone's favorite FPS game is Counter Strike 1.6. What is it so good? First of all it's dynamics. The scene, when you get out from behind the corner and clamp in five, watching as their lifeless body falling dead to the ground, is fascinating. Not many will wail my rating for the game 10 out of 10.
704	1	a	Amazing game, still holds up even after 15 years...    Looks great in 4k.
3262	1	a	Verry cool, verry nice, i like it!
3584	1	a	GREAT! I love to play it, It remembers me on old days :)
3538	1	a	Completely skill based shooter, a lot of teamwork and strategy. Old jem that's been forgotten.
4351	1	a	as
1436	1	a	Pilica wj only
3588	1	a	was fun when it first came out, still fun in 2016.
2087	1	a	Incredible for a game released in 2000. Being the first Counter Strike game, it contains items, physics, sections that can't be found in CS:GO. This game is what paved the way to my personal favorite CS:GO. I would really recommend this game to see what it felt like in the early 2000s.
2196	1	a	OMG RUSSIA IS BAD DONT SAY BAD BECAUSE IM BAD BOY FOR CS 1.6 AND PRO PLAYER DONT HATE DONT INJURE IM DONT KNOW IM SAYING
4734	1	a	this is game is awesome and a classic

4604	1	a	Counter-Strike 1.6: the very first game I played using steam... I used to play it alot... Now there are Counter-Strike games with better graffix. But the original is still damn good!
2185	1	a	old but good
4045	1	a	The counter strike 1.6 game can't be quit. Easy to get used to the people so that he is unable to switch to CS: S, or CS: GO. Maybe the reason I think my favorite FPS game.
371	1	a	So, fall asleep love, loved by me... for I know love, I am loved by thee. Read more at  http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes_of_the_day.html#zvQY7U3Ax27DSMXQ.99

1106	1	a	This is the best game ever. Stands the test of time.
1654	1	a	It has been 2 years since i played counter-strike in my other account. I have at least 400+ hours in this game on another account as i loved it very much, As far as i know, I have CSGO now and i play that instead. I missed this game very much. I hope to get it again. This is just like the other CS games, You play as a Terrorist and Counter Terrorist. The objective of the Terrorist is to use the C4 and blow up 2 area's, Either one could do. A or B. While the Counter-Terrorist's objective is to Stop the bomb from being planted, If it is planted, They have to eliminate all Terrorist and Defuse the bomb. It takes around 5 second's or 10 to defuse, It depends if you have a defuse kit. It's a good game and i recommend it.

3655	1	a	  Nice and fun!!! :)
2495	0	a	dont buy it ... when u will have some error and u cant find a solution no one will help you ... i cant play for almost 1 month because error ' connection problem ' at this game only !!! and i tried everything and no thing is helping ... new steam &amp; new cs &amp; new windows &amp; new antivirus ... and no one at the steam team really care !

1874	1	a	One of the best competitive games of all time. You really feel great while playing this game. Addicting and brutal!
695	1	a	Great game for competitive play even today, all skill and no skins. No eye candy or anything like in Counter-Strike: Global Offensensive, but yes Global Offensive is always another great game.
4648	1	a	This is a classic, would recommend. Its okay 10/10
3554	1	a	1...
1157	1	a	Classic.
2575	0	a	i love this game
3535	1	a	Old but still good. ;)
4421	1	a	Counter -Strike is a great FPS simply about terrorists doing things like bombing supplies or keeping people hostage while the Counter-Terrorist try to defuse the bombs or save the hostages. This game has many great mods and maps that make it fun to come back to. No wonder this game used to be the world's number 1 online action game. If that isn't enough you get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero with it. I would give this game a 9 out of 10.
5142	1	a	Really cool games always been cool love it 10/10
754	1	a	This game proves you don't need best graphics
4247	1	a	this game prove that graphic dosen't matter!!! Game play matter!!!!

I remembered his parting words: 'FUc k John Coltrane's Newphew -- I'd tear my Pseudo Goldfish in that Flyinglotus-eater. Take my Taxi-card, I'm off.' But three avenues deep, I regarded his winter jackettas nothing more than a Sony stance. My first-draft redeemer is a real VB! Wow!!   And don't pose me a steam, you neglector Flying Aphex!

I please urge Mr. Dave to look into this matter. I dont know but after the launch of GO these things became frequent. My friends and me are very unhappy and disappointed at this. I want the old game back. Please help , making this game secure , so that this goes on for generation without harrasement by slow hackers. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. KEEP THE LEGACY GOING.
2072	1	a	the best game ever made!
1133	1	a	:)
3195	1	a	This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,
3845	1	a	Best game of all times, definately worth of buying
