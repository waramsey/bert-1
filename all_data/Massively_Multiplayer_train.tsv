3	1	a	I recommend this game for every masochist! APB:Reloaded features: - Crappy perfomance - Crappy servers - Crappy GMs - Idiots - Hackers - Pay to win After 2600 hours, I still can't stop! ( Help! )

7	1	a	Hiya, I've played this game for a little bit now, and here is some of the reasons for me playing such an ungodly amount of time on this game APB reloaded.   1. This game is a competitive fast paced game that makes you think or die(in-game, can't speak for strokes.) I personally greatly enjoy out thinking my opponents in 1v1-3 fights. The P2W elements doesn't exist. And. the few exceptions with guns on armas(real cash store online) have usually been balanced in a couple of months.  2. Now for some of the cons, laaaaaaggggg. If you don't have a good computer your frames will be 20 fps or worst which will cap how well you can do. Not to mention the servers lag spikes that happen occasionally. Now lets deal with the hacking element. Hackers are rare. I usually see 1-3 blatant hackers per month. I.E. teleporting with a light machine gun(shaw) shooting my car as I (unsuccessfully) escape. ahhhhh the memories. They are usually banned real quick. But, there are more subtle hackes like aimbot and small speed increase that seemingly take longer to ban.   3. Now my raging is out lets focus on the positives. Designing is almost unlimited to your clothes, car , and even the music theme you victims hear when you kill them. There is a design cap for f2p players (like 4 symbols per clothing piece) but G1(the company that owns the game) is pretty good at reguler events that you can win subscription for 3 days or so. So design your heart out! Playing with friends or making friends in game and playing with them is alot of fun, win together and rage together.   4. As I referenced above G1 does holiday and sometimes random events where you can win subscription for a few days, guns, g1 coin(real cash money), or joker tickets....ect ect. I've actually collected enough g1 coins from events to unlock 2 guns permanent for account when they were 50% off. The events themselves are generally fun and different than normal missions. Like the holloween event :).  5. The community, one controversal topic. The general population of apb are usually not jerks (to put mildly), but it can be toxic, and if you don't have some tolerance for idiots you will rage alot. My best advice for handling the community is to have a friend to show off how stupid they can be at times. That is not to say there is no 'good-guys(or gals)' in-game. I have interacted with my fair share of friendly players and (rarely) people I now call friends.   6. This game can be brutal to new players starting. There are many veteran players who will decimate anyone they can heartlessly(sniff sniff). So If your thinking of starting out I cannot emphasis this enough. Stick...to...bronze...districts...........,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.....................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,............................... The game has a threat system. Green, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Based on how good you do, and there are bronze, silver, ect districts you enter where people are the same threat level(skill level) as you are. Good system right? Not so much. The game allows you to enter a district that is one threat level below you. So all the golds (veterans) are in silver disctrict. So silvers and bronzes go to bronze if you want to play against players your skill level and get better(As I did. I spent over half my play time on bronze till I got better and went from silver to gold) Go to disctrict select, go to advanced selecter on the top left, go to a bronze district and hopefully not rage as much. So whenever you are silver go to bronze best advice I can give.  7. The game is a gem of a F2P game and I haven't seen one like it ever. There is alot more details in the game but I think that covers the gist of it. So, I would recomend you to try it. Worst happens you don't like it nothing lost but time, or like me, you can find a game that is alot of fun.   So in closing of this review, thanks for reading it(or skiping to the bottem of the review) Have a good day :)  Firestorm
9	1	a	APB Reloaded is a game with a storied past of a launch that ultimately failed and a company that resurrected a product that many probably believe should've been left to die. Where Realtime Worlds failed to deliver a perfect product, however, GamersFirst has slapped on a number of band-aids and made the best of a bad situation. And we thank them for it.  The main issues of APB Reloaded are in its very particular hardware requirements that will cause the game to hang and crash unless you can work around them - and the deplorable and oft-buggy implementation of the mostly useless PunkBuster service, which has a bad habit of kicking players for its inability to function without initializing services on your PC that often won't load, or can't be found. However, if you can power thorugh, find fixes for and look past the game's shortcomings, the game itself is a blast to play.  The game offers a small but well-designed pair of open-world combat maps wherein you are randomly assigned missions through their well-implemented matchmaking system and battle it out on the streets with handguns, shotguns, fully automatic weapons and much more in what is essentially games of 'Capture the Flag,' 'King of the Hill,' 'Deathmatch' and many more orthodox PvP mainstays. You won't find a lot of new innovations in gameplay, but what the game does, it does well. Game balance is fine-tuned over many years of service, and more recently, it's far less common to see people using aimbots or hacking than it was even a year ago.  The game is at its most frustrating when you find yourself up against players who have, through microtransactions, secured weaponry or vehicles that are very difficult to acquire as a free player. At times, the game feels like a 'Pay to Win' Freemium nightmare, but it still remains skill-based, and though the rich among us have an edge, a veteran TPS player will still find themselves winning as often as they lose. This said, those afraid of the Free-to-Play model, steer clear! This is not the game for you.  The shining point of APB is in its character customization. Peerless in multiplayer games, it allows astounding volume in character creation options, going beyond even facial generation and into custom-made personal decals on the abundant clothing options and tattoos, which you are able to project and position freely on your avatar. No two players look exactly alike, though there are a lot of less imaginitive people who prefer to make Marvel Superheroes or TV characters. And surprisingly, the game holds up graphically even today.  It is a flawed, but ultimately very fun game that you can easily spend hours on.
11	1	a	If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients - To Make the Dough 375 grams (3 cups) plain flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 1/4 cup (50 ml / 3Â½ tablespoons) olive oil 1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water Extra flour for dusting    - To Make Cheese Filling 15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese 5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) '3 Cheese Italian Blend' (Parmesan, Romano &amp; Asiago) Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend. 1/2 cup cheddar cheese 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper   - Extras Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana) Parmesan cheese Basil Fried vegetables Shrimp Fish slices Chicken pieces  Make the Ravioli filling.  - In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork. - Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper. - Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency. - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.   Make the Ravioli dough.  - Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix. - Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. - Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. - Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. - Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. - With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles). - Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesnâ€™t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.   Fill the Ravioli shells.  - Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. - Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. - Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a â€œhomemadeâ€ touch as well. - Repeat this process for all your dough circles. - Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.   Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.  - Roll the dough into two sheets - Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups. - Fill with the ravioli mixture. - Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. - Remove and separate the finished raviolis.  Cook the Ravioli.  - Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. - Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. - If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest  - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates  Serve it up. Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

15	1	a	  So, after ~3300 hours i can definetly say that i am loving this game.  Shortly:  +Awesome designing possibilities! +Alot of people to meet +Ingame Market -&gt; Share of Designs, weapons etc.  -Servers are often laggy -Pretty toxic Community -Difficult for new players  Overall it's worth to give a try.  Recommended! :)
17	1	a	Difficulty: Difficult  The Bottom Line: Solid/Great Score: 8.0  Potentially great game ruined by the game community / chaos and hostile environment.  In a gaming world filled with sci-fi and war-themed multiplayer games, APB seems like a breath of fresh air. It takes place in modern times more or less, in a city torn apart by criminals activity. You have the choice of playing as a Criminal (gang member) or Enforcer (law enforcement) and basically have to carry out missions depending on what type of character you're playing. Often you will have to team with other players and take out 'enemies' as you carry out your mission.  When you first play around with APB: R, it's actually kind of fun. It's like a lite version of GTA mixed in with a little Saints Row. As the action unfolds, San Paro's NPC citizens react to the action as it enfolds, sometimes crouching, screaming, diving for cover, or cursing, making the city come alive.  Your experience As a newbie is pure chaos, frustration, and confusion. Go on the PvP missions and you will get blasted again and again and again relentlessly by extremely high level players or hackers/ cheaters. Slaughtered doesn't even begin to describe what happens. 'Teaming' isn't at all like co-op, where you and a bunch of people interact and help each other out. Usually, it's more like a bunch of random people thrown together with no sense of teamwork who just 'do their own thing' while carrying out a mission and ignoring you and other teammates. Ironically, while keeping silent throughout the entire mission, they'll suddenly grumble in chat about how much the team 'sucked' after the mission is lost, and then angrily leave it. Team leaders will similarly keep quiet during gameplay and not give any guidance throughout, then kick newbies off their missions when things go wrong. But as for now. gamersfirst has fixed this and you no longer get kicked unless you have a demerit medal.  Expect to be kicked/ abandoned during or after a mission a lot if you're a newbie. If you're not sensitive, you'll just become angered by the 'kicking' because by being constantly dumped, you never gain enough experience to get better at the game or meet new friends who you can play with in the future. But if you're a sensitive player, the endless round of being dumped makes the game feel hostile. The chaos is out of this world! You'll be on a mission minding your own business and suddenly a player who isn't part of your mission will just keep ramming the crap out of your vehicle over and over again or running you over. Sometimes even your own teammates will kill you by running you over with a car or shooting you for no reason.  This is exactly what the first few days for the newbie will be like-- slaughter, griefing, uncommunicative teammates, team leaders angrily kicking you off missions, teammates whining about how much their team 'sucked, being abandoned by teammates during missions. Regardless of all that. when it comes to me. having a lot of friends in the game and enjoying every moment having fun while we're playing and laughing and ignoring all the bad in game community. it's all worth it.  What else can you do in game rather than playing? Tons of thingies.  If you're a boy then you can be a 'Girl' if you're a girl then you can be a 'Boy' K-k-Kawaii-everybody wins.  You can stand 24 hours in a social district being busy or simply being afk all day.  You can be a business man or business woman and sell thingies.  You can be a designer and design thingies.  You can be creative and create thingies.  One of the best thing in this game is the Character customization. It's really great how possible you can get your in game character face to look like you in real life. which that is something people in game don't do much. usually similar/preset faces.  Overall: As for 2014. The game is still getting even more better and will get a new solid engine and will get more content and more people to play this great game. Weather you're a veteran or new, make sure to give this game a chance and jump and enjoy the chaos.
19	1	a	APB is a great game when you're winning.
21	1	a	Ahh an honest review?Huh,that can be kinda hard but lets see: 1.Amazing Customization Features 2.Fast paced gameplay(unless you are camping with a sniper like a total idiot) 3.EXTREMELY long-like to unlock everything in a game is a gamer's worst nightmare,but here...well.. you can have a solid 1000 hours and still don't have every unlockable item for your faction,not even gonna talk about maxing both factions. 4.EXPLOSIONS 5.Gamersfirst(the company that made the game)recently changed their office from England to the USA and they are planning to recruit a lot more people and 2017 we are expecting a new engine from Tiggs.Here is a video:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  APB Reloaded engine upgrade render test (in-game capture)&nbsp;
23	1	a	Best way to teach yourself humility.  10/10
25	1	a	While this game does have its up and downs, probably the best part of this game is the customisation that can be achieved with the ingame editors, from recreating a certain song into a 5 second theme to making anime in the symbol editor. While the user generated content is amazing, the game does have a lot of downsides.  First off lets go with the matchmaking system, first off, districts are broken down into threat levels, green being worst and gold being the best. The main issue with this is that the matchmaking is based on the threat level and doesn't take your rep level into consideration, which is actually the level you need to increase to be able to unlock and access better gear so in many cases during my playtime, I being a low leveled player have faced the hell fury of 200 plus repped golds using osmaw's and grenade launchers on people who are still fairly new to the game.  Another issue is certain cash shop guns, while none of them are that dramatically overpowered to be considered litterally pay2win (Like there's no sniper rifle that can kill someone at full health in one shot). Most of them will give an advantage over other players, such as a joker cr5 thats moddable from when you start playing to buying pre-made guns such as a whisper, although the beginning weapon known as a STAR by the community, was actually buffed or tweaked to make it not so useless.  Now lets move on to bugs, like most f2p titles, a lot of bugs don't really get fixed until way later on in time, there are a few exploits in this game that allow players to get certain objectives stuck behind walls (This is common with capture the flag objectives) to players attempting to get out of the map (Mainly only in fight club). While those are exploits that players could abuse if they discovered them. There are also some bugs that will screw over your play experiance, such as random disconnects and crashes.  I also do not recommend playing APB if you have less than 8GB RAM on your computer, this game loves to eat up memory, my guess is that APB reloaded loves to store texture memory within the RAM in order to allow fast loading, to be honest I doubt i'm right, but its my only guess as to why it'd hog up so much resources.  And next off is the servers, laggy and litterally unstable, from horrible lag spikes when a district is full to litterally dropping client connections for no bloody reason what so ever, which is the main reason preventing me from playing the game propperly. Ontop of that is the slow and small patches applied to the game each week, while its good to finally see the game getting updates that were needed 6 months ago, this new movement by the devs to switch the games engine to a newer version of unreal 3 feels too late as the playerbase continues to decrease in size.  But I also forgot, punkpuster is litterally the worst anti-hack program I have ever seen, its just as bad as all those third-party or first-party anti-cheat rootkits most other MMOs force install onto your computer, it litterally doesn't do anything to stop hackers, the game has some pretty known active cheaters roaming around. Although personally imo, any anti-cheat tool that waits before banning doesn't work with any F2P title since these guys can just make new accounts every single time.  Overall I feel APB reloaded does have the capability to be something amazing, I am willing to support the game aslong as the improvements continue, I just wish it was more than just 1 ltitle fix or one tweak every week, I also wish the servers wouldn't dc me constantly and I also wish new clothes packs didn't cost 40-50 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dollars.
27	1	a	Awesome game! Definitely worth your time!  I am a leader of a clan and i have 5 years of experience in this game. I make this review to proof to you that this game is worth your time.  1) I never payed for this game, i'm gold for 3-4 years in a row now (In the first year i had a very bad pc and internet connection which was the reason me being bad mostly). I use free to play guns, mostly N-Hvr (Given or Bought with game money) and i'm winning against 85-90% of the players who are using guns they bought in shops for real money. Its true that i had some struggling moments at the beginning, but it was all worth it. Don't forget that i started 5 years ago... They made it more simple for starters now. I also want to inform you that there are many opportunities to earn real money (G1C) to buy stuff (guns, kits, ...) in the armas market for doing events which are explained to you in the forums of this game.  2) The community in this game is awesome, i can't give it another word. In every game there will be som D**ks but that is inevitable, generally speaking, 8 to 10 of the people you will meet are very friendly.  Other good points i experienced in this game; -Updating the game on regular basis -Good graphics. -Detailed character/car design capabilities -Can make nice music themes / songs -VERY good player support  Some lesser points i experienced; -Some people out of your mission are preventing you from proceeding, keeping you from critical time (Happens rarely). -I myself do not have this problem, but some of my friends can't play the game cause of FPS lagg. -If your friend is silver and you are gold, it is highly possible you get 2 golden opponents matched against you (This is the only major problem in this game at this moment in my opinion). It is even possible that 3 golds are matched against 4 silvers. The 3 golds win easily cause they have more experience / team play. This is also the reason for the negative comments about people saying this game is p2w, which it isn't. The game itself is perfectly playable with f2p guns like i do. Its just the matching system which needs some more attention.  Hope this helped you :)  P4wn - Enforcer- 'Sharp' Leader - Patriot EU2
29	1	a	Good game, stressful at times.
31	1	a	Having been riding shotgun on this rocky slope since the engine first breathed life, I've bared witness to the rise and fall of many events both majestic and miniscule. From the very beginning, connecting across the ocean to the Real Time Worlds European server to participate in the closed beta program through one scheduled hour a week, I felt that there was something metaphysical at work. Something without form, without function, sleeping beneath the silver sheen of this seemingly genre changing cops and robbers MMO.   There was something there behind the flying bullets, the untapped expression of creativity driven forth from every player, the static walls of San Paro and it's fleeing citizens. Like a father watching his infant son strike his first fluke homerun well out of the confines of the park, I remember excitedly tossing and considering the possibilities of a game like APB. It was destined for many things, much of which can only be described as allegory in light of the failed future this game was given by fate.   The son that knocked the ball out of the park, he could have been in the Major Leagues. He could have been so much more. Instead, somewhere between that first fluke shot and college, he found drugs and greed and turned that bat into a tool of violence for the dealer that provided him with his fix. The story of APB, sadly, is not that much different.  I stand now with a precious handful of survivors that took the train and never got off, and it is from this seat that I can humbly nominate APB Reloaded for the 'Monument To What Could Have Been' award.    Nothing further, your honor.
33	1	a	great game if you want to lose your hair and die early.  10/10
35	1	a	  Definitely one of a kind.    Don't be fooled with my hours played here in Steam, I actually have one character that has over 1,800 hours played. And did I mention that is just for one character? Not just that, but I've been playing this game since its Open Beta Phase during 2011, and that is even before it was released here in Steam.     1. Background   - The game was first released on June 2010 under the name 'APB: All Points Bulletin', where in the game design was led by David Jones, who created the original Grand Theft Auto. During this time, the game was subscription based. But on November 2010, the developer has announced that the game will be shut down due to lack of development process, management focus, and the desire to make the game better. But on March 2011, the game was revived and sent to Closed Beta where 5,000 players were invited. Then it has been released on May 2011 to Open Beta.    2. Graphics   - The game is still using an old engine, therefore in its current state even if you can run Grand Theft Auto V on the highest settings, you're still going to face some stutters here. But the developers have announced a roadmap for this year, and it includes an engine upgrade.     3. Content   - Most of the contents are recycled, weapons re-skins are common, and some are just brought back to life from the old development. The team currently doesn't have anyone who can animate as well.    4. Gameplay   - I'll be honest, it may look like a Pay2Win game for those who are new to the game because of the weapons that can be bought from the in-game cash shop called Armas Marketplace. Other than that, the game also has a very steep learning curve. Yes, it is pretty easy to play the game but it's actually hard to be good at it. Most of the time you'll be thinking your oppositions are using aimbots or triggerbots. But if you give it time, learn the different uses of each weapons, techniques on how to take advantages of the situation, learn the different tactics to win, and etc., you will be more than rewarded. Because let me tell you, stock weapons can beat the hell out of this paid weapons.    5. Customization   - Given the old engine, some parts of the customization may hinder you from what you're trying to achieve. BUT! Never have I encountered a game like this, you can literally create any designs you have in mind. You have a shirt in your closet that you want your character to wear? No problem, you can! But the only catch here is... You have to be good at it. This is one of the reasons why I'm still playing this game, it's because I can be who I want my character to be.    If ever you're interested in checking out some of the clothes/outfits/vehicles I made you may check them out  here.       6. Micro-transactions   - The only lifesaver this game has. The cash shop is pretty much expensive, why? You want a cool looking clothing pack that only consists of about 5 items, sure, just pay them 10$ for that. It even offers weapons that can be overpowered to those who are new.   Update: They have released packs that includes tons of new items bundled into one. The pack actually costs 40$, but if we're going to analyze the content, it's worth more than what they're asking.    7. Conclusion   - Even with my huge hours of playing this game, I also had some breaks. There are times that you just want to stop and get over it. But sooner or later, you'll find yourself searching for something to repalce this game. If you first thought that this is just another Grand Theft Auto clone, then you're wrong. I admit, at first that was also my first impression. Time goes by, I realized it is nowhere near it, it's a different breed of game.
37	1	a	actually terrible
39	1	a	  It needs a seperate tutorial map (also instructions for the controls). That way, new players won't be confused in the situation they're in.
41	1	a	APB:R Is a truly outstanding freemium game, You get the large choice of trying to keep peace and order as an enforcer, or burn, smash and wreck the city San Paro. This games offers a new level of customization, you cannot only costumize your self, but your cars, clothes, spray, music, and more.  You will be able to enjoy this one of a kind urban freemium game to the max, even if youre a F2P, Because P2P called Premiums ingame, only get 25% bonus on their income from missions and misc, aswell as their reputation.  This game is highly enjoyable with a friend, and there is plently of room to freeroam in the streets and highways of San Paro.  Criminal: Ram storefronts, Mug people, sell cars, deliver goods, or cause a random destruction! A criminal's limits of income is his fear of being witnessed by any enforcer.  Enforcer: Pin down the Criminals as youre slowly stalking them, and as you see they get more and more dirty cash on them you witness them the last secound to take their loot and return it as edvidence for a big reward. As an enforcer youre not 'allowed' to drive down neutral npcs nor destroy the enviroment such as a mailbox.  The Graphics: The graphical level of this game is also at its max, you can any time turn them down/off in case your computer sadly cannot run it fully, but everything in this game is beuatyful and highly detailed.  Weapons: You will get a free permanent weapon called STAR 556 its a lovely riffle, fully automatic and well balenced, as a secondary you get to carry the Obeya FBW, and there is two other ways of gaining new weapons by Leasing or Purchasing from ARMAS(APB:R shop) By leasing a weapon up to 7 days or use a (sadly) large sum of your money on some permanent weapons.  Vehicles: This i cannot put down good enough but the cars are one of the most enjoyable features in this game! Theyre each very unique and offers a great pleasure as youre driving them around in San Paro, with a friend hanging out of the window or not :)  Enviroment: In the streets of San Paro, you quickly figure out where to stay when youre ramming, or where to stay if youre mugging, and the same for enforcers, many enforcers have their little 'route' they travel to see if anyone is witnessable (Means the criminal and enforcer get to battle for the dirty money). San Paro is a beuatyful city offering many wonderful places to visit, either youre at a dark alley runnning for your life, or at a contacts place having a blast.  PVP!: This game is purely based on pvp, but not only do you need to focus on other players against you but also those who are with you because know what? FRIENDLY FIRE IS ON! :D that feature is out of our reach and we will have to deal with it, I am personally loving that feature as the game pushes you even further to take caution for your enviroment.  Overall: This game is far beyond my belief of a good freemium game, but its balanced alot and well done! few for and against  +PVP +Cars/Enviroment +Costumization +Wide amount of weapons be it leased or purchased. +Open world, freeroam +Balanced freemium gameplay, no-one is TOO overpowered *cough nano,colby,csg.*  -Threat, once you reach gold, youre forced into suicide to regain your silver title. the reason i will put this here is. A gold can only join gold. but a silver can join silver AND gold, and bronze can join bronze silver and gold. -It can be boring to play alone, but as youre going into some missions you will be paired with others.  Last thing i want to add is the community, it can be different from each day but MAINLY people are incredible, ive met a handful of people ive grown a care for. Thanks guys If youre interested in playing with me as such make a Criminal on EU1 and join me :)  I will rate this game a full 10/10    
43	1	a	This game was amazing in its early stages. It still is a decent game but my opinion has changed because of the market abuse. The game has turned to a pay to win game. I would still recommend the game to anyone who wants to get in a car with some friends and shoot at some cops or the opposite.  Recommendation: Play with the expectation that if someone buys a market place gun you'll be at a disadvantage but on the good side the game has a great customization feature for vehicles and cloths.
45	1	a	APB Reloaded summed up, is a roller-coaster of a game. There will be days were you are on fire and loving the game. Then there will be days were nothing is going right, and youâ€™re wondering why you ever tried the game out in the first place. I canâ€™t tell you if itâ€™s a good game or not, thatâ€™s your decision as a person. What I can tell you is this. If you go into the game expecting to win a lot and go super saiyan youâ€™re in for a load of hurt. But if you go in to the game just to have some fun or blow off some time, who knows you might be in for a surprise. Yes winning is a lot more fun than loosing but winning isnâ€™t everything. Give the game a try, itâ€™s free. I mean what do you have to lose? Time?
47	1	a	I did not spend that much time.   (Update) I have now realized this game has been causing me a great amount of stress. This game is exactly why my wooden chair i would sit in won't stand on its legs anymore.
49	1	a	APB is loaded with kids calling others children 'kids' Ù©(à¹Ì¯Í¡à¹)Û¶   They are usually around puberty, and hormonal disorders hit them really hard: Drama, Attitude, Disrespect, Aggressivity, Sass, Egocentrism.
51	1	a	This game obviously still needs some development such as optimization, but honestly that's about it. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys teamplay or just fun. Once in to Silver servers it become more competitive so practice to be able to play there against most players. The game still has a small issue of dealing with hackers but from the start hackers have been less and less seen. The game is NOT pay to win, all the armas market items are simply reskins of guns that you can buy from contacts, and even some of the guns you can buy from contacts seem to be better then a lot of the guns you can buy from Armas market.  All in all a good game. :)
53	1	a	GamersFirst has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up a lot, Punkbuster and Firefight suck, and the game has a knack for being 'Pay 2 win' (It isn't really... really. It isn't.)  But, the game is fun and the customization options are actually amazing. So yes, I recommend playing it.
55	1	a	If you wan't:  - Cheaters; Blatant &amp; Closet Alike -  GM's 24/7 Around The World!  No GM's monitoring the playerbase... - Inconsistent game mechanics due to the game's direction... - Lag - Ponies - Unstable Servers  APB:R is the game for you!  -9/7 *
57	1	a	The relaunch of APB was proper, given the potential of the game, and the new free-to-play format is well suited to the characteristics of this discrete action game-style sandbox. The addition of new locations and the optimization of certain mechanics have certainly had the merit of making the experience more pleasant and multifaceted, and we must add that the outlay of real cash is absolutely not a requirement, especially not at the beginning They have high expectations and want to evaluate the product well. However a number of shortcomings is not insignificant relative to the controls, the feeling of weapons and, not least, the quality of the matchmaking and connection in general. It will therefore be interesting to see how and what APB Reloaded will be improved between now and a few months. As new beginning however, it is moderately encouraging.
59	1	a	Awesome Game! It's Like GTA or Saint Row .... Is Open World :)  By:#CRISTIAN1ELITE
61	1	a	Its cops and robbers meets gta, fun stuff.
63	1	a	I've decided to revise my recommendation.   This game is fun.... When you're winning, when you're losing you really just want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing murder and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the other team.   Be prepared to get called names like: hacker, noob, buy weapon â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, macro â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, wallhacker, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ucker, neckbeard virgin, no-life unemployed â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, rich â™¥â™¥â™¥ whitekid (guess that's an insult now?), ponyfag, genderbendending-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-sucking-ultramega-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
65	1	a	Great game, you dont really need to pay any money for it to be fun but I mean it helps I guess. Plus its free so if you dont like it you arent really loseing anything but time.
67	1	a	Brilliant idea.... The game looks amazing, little unbalanced at some points, but it's still kinda amazing... graphics is very good for a f2p type and the gameplay too. Everything customizable from characters, clothes to cars. Nice team based actions.. It would be way better If most of the ppl are not kids and also there is some annoying cheaters, but the game is good.. Recommended to only Hardcore/pro players. 8/10
69	1	a	Curse you Lag !! That put aside , this is a really entertaining and competitive collage of intense firefights pitting good against evil . Unique customization options allow you to create your imagined super soldier to wreak havoc or bring peace . It's dominate or be dominated !
71	1	a	This is the best worst game I've ever played. The highs are very high, and the lows are very frequent. This game is like heroin. Once you've played it for a while, it's very hard to quit.   Despire what some people are saying cheating isn't as common as they say. Having spent 3000-3500 hours playing this game, I can say that from experience. There have been more than a few closets and quite a few blatants, that's true. But it's not nearly as bad as it seems. Most of the 'cheaters' are people who've spent 1000+ hours and are in 3rd party VOIP (IE Mumble, TS, or Vent) communcating. I've been hackusated many times for things like that. As an experienced player you gain a sense of what your opponent is going to do, and if you react to what your instincs tell you, half the time you'll get a hackusation. The game also has more than a few bugs. Sometimes you'll literally see players names through a wall for no apparent reason, Or a wall will simply not load immediately letting you see through it.   While I'm not sure if I could recommend it to friends anymore, I definitely enjoy the game. The few friends I've tried to get into it have played about 20 missions and then quit because they ended up against premade teams that absolutely wreck them, over and over and over and over again.
73	1	a	No matter what team you choose, you will get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ kicked unless you have a lot of luck.  This is one of those games where it's a LOT more fun with friends, without them all you have is trying to make friends, missions, etc etc.   Another thing you hear a lot about. Hackers. Lots of them. Or just really good players.  Overall:  Melon/10
75	1	a	Try it out. No p2w. Customization is pretty amazing.
77	1	a	Anyone looking for a new kind of MMO should give APB: Reloaded a download. While the Armas Marketplace offers a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, and aesthetic items be assured that this is a well balanced Free to Play title and requires no purchase for the full experience. Character customization reaches a whole new level with their persona, outfit, vehicle, and symbol editors and the maps themselves are created with great detail.  Though the game can be difficult to learn at first, as the mechanics are quite different from most other open-world shooters, and the Armas Marketplace suffers from the same tragically over-inflated prices that most Free to Play games tend to this is a very solid game with a lot to offer. Action is always guaranteed and with plenty of unlocks and mission types you're sure to find yourself unable to walk away easily.
79	1	a	Its a lot of fun, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're one of those - like me - who gets frustrated when you die.  This is a game of skill. There's no classes and no real perks or talents that can give you an advantage in a fire fight. Buying weapons character modifications (such as body armor) can increase your chances, but only slightly and will not necessarily make it impossible for a new player to kill you if you make a mistake.
81	1	a	Good game -&gt; I Enjoy the design/customizable part the most!;
83	1	a	Best online game os steam!! :)
85	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game to play, I met many great friends there and had fun most of the time. Definitely recommend this game for others to try out. I loved the customization ability this game provides. One thing i disliked though is constant lag warps, a big pain. But this might just be my problem. In addition, Gamersfirst (Aka G1) have really expensive Armas prices(where you buy in-game items with cash(Gamersfirst Credits)). Whoever, this game is not pay to win, some may say it is but it's really not. Hope this helped!
87	1	a	This is probably my favorite game of all time. I love this game for many reasons. One reason being that it has an EXTREMELY wide array of customization features. You can customize pretty much everything from weapons to clothes to cars to custom themes to play whenever you kill someone! Another reason this game is so amazing is because of the gameplay. It never gets boring or bland (especially when playing with friends!) It is also so much fun to pop out and shoot someone down that is about to score the last winning point to cause you to lose the mission. The game has awesome and hilarious physics that will cause your car to literally FLY in the air whenever you hit a ramp! The game is overall very smooth, extremely fun, and very versatile and different. I like to think of it as if GTA and a Cops and Robbers style game had a baby. This game is fantastic.

91	1	a	#1 Free to play game :)
93	1	a	It sucks so hard but I keep coming back to it.
95	1	a	How To Play: 1). Start Game  2). Spend 3-10 hours creating character 3). Try to play but gives error 4). Rate the game 10/10 GOTY IGN GAME JOLT 
97	1	a	It is awesome and i love the customization options everywhere with clothes, cars, weapons, symbols, music, themes, srays and many more HOWEVER.... the PvP sucks BIG time, the enforcers are too weak and the criminals are to over powered with a ton of damage and they have to lower the damage delt by criminals... I mean.... do you really think criminals will have the upper hand in reality?  Yep, i rest my case :| oh well, i still like playing it but the PvP system needs to be changed or else this game will become dead to me :|
99	1	a	Of course this game is the best  :D 
101	1	a	Figure its time for an update, I started playing apb about 2 years ago and in that time have put in around 4000 hours of gameplay. I really do enjoy this game and I feel people deserve an unbiased opinion before trying it out. So I present both positive and negative points here.   First lets talk about hackers, everybody says hackers this hackerst that. No. period. Yes like any online game there is hackers, lets take any given day though, I do around 25-40 missions on any given day, maybe one or two of those missions will have a hacker in them. In fight club its a bit different, there is no missions its just the same stuff over and over kinda an easy place to farm kills close quarters and stuff so hackers go in there and use an aimbot but again thats not an all the time thing its just something that happens because hey its an online game.   Next lets talk about 'Pay 2 Win' some don't know the actual meaning of that phrase so im going to explain, P2W means that you can pay cash money for an instant advantage over others in game. Now to some extent I guess you could say its pay to win in that manner, the actual cash shop 'Armas Marketplace' has various things, cars, guns, etc. The difference is you can buy them account bound, say you buy a 3 slot gun (slots being open for modifications that change guns ie: mag pull allows you to reload faster at the cost of a set ammount of ammo being short from the clip, where as extended mags has more ammo to a clip but takes longer to reload. They are unlocked in game and cant be used until you hit rank 40 which takes about a day or two) and you got it account bound, well you could have this gun with 3 slots on it on a new character, but that doesnt change much, all guns that you can get from armas marketplace are either reskins (same mechanics as the normal gun just different look and sound ultimately feeling different but having no advantage over the original gun) of the guns in game or they are available to buy with joker tickets which can be earned by doing daily activities and playing in fight club. Or you could buy a car, say you play as a criminal but you want a car from the enforcer faction such as the Jericho, you can buy that on armas with 4 slots and drive it on your criminal. There is also clothing packs/items and weapon skins/camos available but none of this changes the base of the game, however the game does have premium on armas marketplace as well which all that does is give a substantial increase to money and exp gain as well as allow you to have up to i think 100 symbols per item (not sure i dont customize often) set your clan name as a title so people can see it easier, and lowers the cool down on your active character mod by one minute. I personally have around 2,000$ (two thousand) in my account because its what i enjoy so I support them and will continue to. I have i think 35-40 account bound guns, most of the clothing packs, key to the world, key to the city, and almost every car as a 4 slot through armas on my main character.   Moving on, next topic, the game engine is currently unreal engine 2 but they have been working on a new engine for a few years and it is almost ready for release, read into it more on the forums and blog posts.   Customization, its a big deal in apb and I have honestly never seen another game with such an in depth character customization.   Im honestly too lazy to continue this review and would rather just go play the game instead of talking about it, however if you have any questions feel free to add me and ask, or even watch my steam broadcast im playing 70% of the time.
103	1	a	Nice game ;D I thinkin this game need lithuania language ^^
105	1	a	I recommend this game. Most of this review comes from Last August, which was when I last put a lot of hours into the game. Recently I've been trying to get back into it. If you want to play with me, I'm looking for people to play with on the Joker NA server. Just started up a new character. Anyways, here's the review:  This game is a lot, and I mean a lot of fun. I'll be completely honest with you, there used to be a lot of server lag, but now it's perfectly optimized. It is so addicting and fun, with so many different customizations option for guns/clothing/vehicles/weapons it's just awesome. I LOVE this game. I'm finally getting back into it after a while.  The things that I dislike: The amount of time it takes to obtain a good amount of money. (it doesn't take that long if you have Premium.) Premium could have... a little more benefits. There seem to be a lot of cheaters. It's somewhat hard to obtain certain vehicles, and atleast on The Joker server, it costs a lot for a good vehicle/mod/weapon/theme song. That's pretty much it.   
107	1	a	The game itself is good, open-world. You can create your character, customize it, choose to be the Enforcers or Criminals. You can customize your car, your clothes, your stats, weapons, etc...   The bad parts: ALERT* Toxic and bad community, 80% Hackers. Fairfight's ban's everywhere... ** Random server lags or server going down. *** Very unbalanced matchmaking **** Pay2Win but still you can get your items, but requires alot of time, luck? and skill?  Well... The game is still fun to play with your friends so... 6/10
109	1	a	This is a fun game so much to do i find it fun to witness crims and robbing stores but overall i recomend this game
111	1	a	  APB Reloaded - Siuya's Review 
113	1	a	Simply the best.
115	1	a	This game is broken. It's drains your money and your soul. You can expect every person you meet to be a hacker. And no matter how good your rig is, you can expect to barely be able to run it.  But it's 'free to play' and I drove around in a van with hentai painted on the side of it for an hour then got it blown up. So I guess it's pretty cool. 
117	1	a	Great game idea but gamersfirst doesnt care that much about the players, they should be called gamerslast moneyfirst but still like the gameplay!
119	1	a	i've played 'APB-RELOADED' for 3 and half years. Yet i still love this game. reasons i loving it: - Nice shooter game, graphics are cute but after new engine update it will be awesome game. - it's a very successful game for 6-GB little game :D - i can create what ever by the symbols for friends and customers and trade with g1c :D - All my Steam friends are from APB. i don't think u can find that awesome friends in different games :D - it's fun and funny at the same time. Pack of cheaDorrrs getting banned every day. Lucky ones will be punished too :P - Reffer friend stuffs are really saving free players but still free players can trade and be like a donator :3 - Lately they are making awesome g1c buyable packs, new items and getting well on it tho. so future items are brighter. - When you play for fun you enjoy the game. Play to win players never enjoys the game.  - Try to have fun no matter what happens in this virtual battlefield^^ &amp; you will love every thing in APB   (TO BE HONEST!)     Just reviewing this for Steam points.. TEHEhehe...   XD
121	1	a	Worst game ever, 10 out of 10!
123	1	a	Pay to win, Pay to enjoy. Payments are love. Payments are life.  Minimum:  Processor:Intel Core 2 Duo E6420 (2.13GHz) or AMD Athlon x2 5800+ (3.0GHz)  Memory:3 GB RAM  Graphics:GeForce 7800 with 256MB and support for Pixel Shader 3.0, or AMD equivalent  DirectXÂ®:dx90c  Hard Drive:7 GB HD space    Credit card: $50+[/b]  
125	1	a	Jesus guys. I'm just going to be honest with you- stop looking for bad reviews. Its a free to play game, so just download it and play it. If you don't like it, then delete it. What is the worst that could happen anyways?  The hackers? Ok now for real, there are hackers in like every game. I even met an aim-bot hacker in CS:GO. So stop complaining about the hackers because any game can be easily hacked.  Oh, so you just spawned in and you died by a grenade? Big deal! Someone buys CS:GO and gets sniped by an AWP they automatically refund the game? No! They just get better at the game. And if you really need it just click on the 'Advanced' option while picking a district and click on one with a green orb next to it.  So just get the game and if you don't like it delete it.
127	1	a	I got a 3 guns for spending $300 on the game.
129	1	a	Apb Reloaded = A lot of lagg even with a gtx 750 2gb ti OC 40fps. U need a Nvidia Titan black. 16gigs of ram *Its a must* A i7 Extreem edition K version so u can overclock on max. And then u can play the game with 50-60fps. U need to play this game atleast more then 1000 Hours to Counter the hackers with ur legit skills*Most are closets so u can outplay them with your 1000hours of experience* Unless they get mad and put wall hack aimbot all on. btw the new engine upgrade is fake so people stay longer at the game and spend more money.  WELCOME TO APB:R
131	1	a	If the game got rid of it's pay-to-win elements and instead just priced it at $5 or somewhere close, the game would be a slam dunk. It's all you ever wanted out of an online GTA, and better than GTA V online, purely based on mechanics. Sure, the vehicles, guns, and graphics might not be as competitive, but the mechanics are what really matters. The bonding between you and your crew as you ram storefronts and run over pedestrians all whilst shooting at the police makes it worth putting up with the cheap feeling you get from the pay-to-win crap.
133	1	a	APB reloaded is a great game in my opinion. The costumization in this game is just insane. Over a million combinations possible with your character and vehicle design. Upgrades onto your weapons, character and car. Such as 'Increased car explosion radius' Or 'Mobile ammo box' Or for your charcter 'Kelvar implants' .... It's insane.  The gameplay is extremely fun to play, but also extremely easy to make you rage. My advise would be to play for short whiles. About 1 hour, take 15 minutes break and another hour. Other then all that, it's no P2W (You can buy weapons, but everything is normally achievable without having to pay), and you can really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with people, it's funny as hell!. My rating on this game is 8.5/10
135	1	a	Three words... PAY TO WIN.
137	1	a	This is a fun game it is easy but sometimes hard. You can customize ur person and unlock and buy the weapons. As a COP and BAD MAN you can do mission. There is cars you can get and you can buy cars and customize them. LOVE GAME A LOT C: 
139	1	a	This game is literally crack. It will addict you and eat your soul. 10/10 would smoke
141	1	a	this game is awsome i love it so much,everyone should play it and please don't make it to cost money
143	1	a	never played it but here is my review
145	1	a	Ok Well It's Pretty Fun Trying to get money and buy new clothes :/ thats it...
147	1	a	very good game. its like gta but without the strippers. i think the only problem with this game is is that there arent any tutorials or how tos when you first start so your kinda on your own in terms of how to customize things. friend me: thatguy622
149	1	a	THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD 
151	1	a	i hate this game so much but holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me if i don't love it 10/10
153	1	a	Still one of the best shooter MMOs on the net. What I personally keep in mind when thinking of APB is the most unfriendly community someone can imagine. If you have a good run, they call you a hacker, if you have a bad run, you're called a 'r3t4rd': Laugh or Leave! ;)
155	1	a	THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD 
157	1	a	Good Game And Fun.
159	1	a	This is one of the worst games I have EVER played. That still doesn't mean it's not fun, because it is. It's a ton. A ton. of fun. APB: Funloaded.
161	1	a	Now I know my hours of gameplay for this game doesn't say much, but hear me out anyways.  APB:R is an open world MMO where the players could either be the criminals or the enforcers. The roles are quite self-explainatory   The gameplay itself is quite what you would expect from any other third-person game, run to cover, peep out, unload your guns, that or you could just jump out and spray your munition and pray that it lands on the target. The gameplay however isn't what fascinates me, it is the customization option that you apply to your ride or your player model. You can create your very own designs from scratch, whether or not it ends up as tattoo or a car decal, the endless possiblity of creation is simply just mind blowing (Provided that you unlock all the customization option). As someone who studies graphic designs, this is my nice cup of tea.   Note: Premium players can put in more customization items on their clothings/car/tattoos compared to f2p players.  Of course, since this is a free to play game there are in-game items that you can buy to give you an edge against your opposition. Personally however, I think this game is still reasonable even if you are a f2p player.  The only downside for me is probaly the community inside the game. I'm not sure about the other servers, but the server I'm currently residing in is just..just.... full of twelve years old who are uncapable of listening to reason and logic. Oh yeah. Also expect â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. Lots and lots of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.
163	1	a	nice game good graphics its gta mmo
165	1	a	i love this game :D 
167	1	a	Still one of the best shooter MMOs on the net. What I personally keep in mind when thinking of APB is the most unfriendly community someone can imagine. If you have a good run, they call you a hacker, if you have a bad run, you're called a 'r3t4rd': Laugh or Leave! ;)
169	1	a	Game that used to be brilliant 2 years ago turned into something many wish it'd never happen. If i would look at the game through prism of the past I'd say it's game that puts MMOTPS genre into the next gen and has a lot of potential that yet has to be revealed... but it was 2 or even 3 years ago. As for today? Don't bother to try this game, servers are running poorly, gameplay mechanics are broken, community is awful and good players have difficulties to get opposed mmission due to matchmaking system yet even with those issues this game has moments when it really is fun. Beside of all these issues this game also has the biggest rage startling factor that i've ever seen in any game before as it's not just about your skill but how good are you at dealing with factors that you don't have control about.
171	1	a	APB is back and now Free-to-Play! If you like the idea of a massively multiplayer GTA or more specifically Crackdown, then you'll love APB. The character customization is by far the most DETAILED and INSANE that I've ever seen, and me likey.
173	1	a	this game sucks if you are not a sick dank top fragger like myself and others that i play with if you do not play with me or the others with you are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and dont deserve to be a top fragger like myself and you should quit this game because Tiggs the community manager of this amazing game will find you and ban you and say you were ban evading even though you really weren't this is pure meth i love it and hate it at the same time the only reasons i hate it is because the management is complete dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and i hope they all die sometime. but i still play it and enjoy it somewhat because im a top fragger\   ALSO if you are actually good at the game 'FairFight' will ban you! this happened to me twice!
175	1	a	Hit a guy with a car , he flew atleast 50m into the air while having an uncontrollable seizure.  12/10
177	1	a	Personally, I really like this game, and have devoted quite a while into it. The patches and all do move along at a somewhat slow rate, given the small dev team, but I think its actually a really good game. I read some of the other reviews and I will address some of the issues mentioned.  Pay2Win- Basically every gun in the ARMAS Marketplace is a reskin of a gun you get from in-game progression, and the few execeptions have lots of downsides to balance their upsides. Anyone who claims that guns are p2w most likely hasn't gone to the cash shop and trialed the guns, which by the way, you can do, trialing all of the guns for 30minutes/3hours depending if you have premium membership. Really though, the in-game progression weapons are on par, or even better than their cash shop counterparts.  Hackers-  This community is so paranoid of hackers, its pretty much a given that either one person might seem like they are hacking, or you will get hackusated. Just realize that its possible that people are better than you, because some people have been around 4-5 years, since the start in RTW times.  Lag- At the time of this post, one of the districts, Waterfront, has been rather laggy, but they have been working on a fix for it, and the lag only occurs when there are more than 60 people per instance (excess people can move to a different instance to fight the lag, but sometimes they just don't)  Okay, and one more thing, its not as if you are paying $60 + DLC galore, its a free game. I understand this game might not be for everyone, mainly people that can't accept that people are better than them, and resort to calling people hackers or calling weapons p2w. Give it a shot, though, because it truly is pretty good quality for a f2p game.  
179	1	a	good game just waiting for a mac version!
181	1	a	APB is a great game though it has a toxic community that might deter new players. It's a milestone for customization in games. You can cuztomize any part of your character (height, weight, muscularity, freckles, hair) you can make your own symbols to use on clothes and tattoos and cars. You can cuztomize your car with kits, symbols, upgrades, paint jobs, etc. The player can also cuztomize their weapons with skins and upgrades. Most of my time is spent socializing, driving, and designing then showing off my clothes. I highly recommend it to anyone with a creative mind.
183	1	a	i love this game :D 
185	1	a	Do you want to play a game where you can steal cars...drive them and destroy them because you always wanted to do it? Or do you want to shoot the sh*t out of your enemy and enjoy the physics of the dead body flying from that building you shot him before? Or do you just want to play GTA online? This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ awesome game does include every aspect mentioned! Play as a crime or an enforcer, it is your choice.

189	1	a	Somewhat fun, but HORRIBLY broken.  Broken matchmaking, Broken grouping, very cheap overused gun combinations, heavily promotes being a horrible player and camping.  Luckily this game is hanging by a string, it will be dead from lack of funds soon.
191	1	a	Game aint dead, still worth hoping on not pay to win, just whiny noobs claiming it is.
193	1	a	if you play with friends it is very good game
195	1	a	Dont let the majority of negative reviews turn you down. I wil admit this game stil need work (performance wise)   But the major problem i see , is that most players dont know what Squad based tactical shooter is. If u join a random group you wil see that almost everybody just rushes to the objective (like its COD) thinking they can do it alone?  But if u sit down, create a team / communicate and play smart its actualy way more fun and u have a good chance of winning.  For this i believe most of the negative reviews are written by them Call of Duty / Leageu of legends players who just arent used to being pacient.   The rushed player wil die a lot and dislike this game. The Pacient player that thinks before he runs in will have more fun and enjoy the game more!   Simply get your friends together before u jump into APB =) Dont be focussed on the *winning* part and its a lot of fun and fierce competition that ive always enjoy sinds the launch of APB.  The only downsides are the Performance isseus's   (ps. only noobs complain about the weapons) 
197	1	a	(Note: I have not played this game in many years).  So, this can be a fun game.. The community sucks, but it can be fun at times. I'm just going to put an up-vote on it simply for the good times I had on it (while at the same time trying not to think of the bad times). I could make a really serious, thoughtful review, like usual. I even typed one up and erased it.   You know what, I'll make a somewhat decent review. That sounds nice. So:   Lag: There is a lot of it. Everyone on the server lags, Heck, the server itself lags. Try out the two closest servers to you. I used to play on one server that I thought would be the best for me, but it turned out that the next closest one was better. The difference was barely noticable while playing, but it made all of the difference.  Hackers: Are there any? For the most part, not really. At least when I used to play, there were not.There were a few rare cases, but it was not often. What I noticed when changing from one server to the other is that I lagged just half a second less than other people, letting my hits register like they were supposed to and everything worked normally. Different connections to the server can make a big difference.  Pay to win: This game is really big on paying for weapons with real cash. There are a few guns that simply can't (in my opinion) be beaten that are hard to buy ingame with ingame money. One of these is a sniper rifle that makes it really easy to jump into the air and shoot someone with extreme accuracy. No other gun in the game has this ability. There are ways to get it without paying a dime, however it is difficult to do, and the weapons will probably expire after a while. (Note: while pay-to-win weapons do give people an advantage, skill plays a lot into it. If you take the standard, default rifle, if my memory is correct I believe it was named the STAR, you can usually hold your own. It is reliable close up and at a medium to long distance.)  Note: I have way more hours than steam shows, and I have never put a single penny into this game. It isn't/wasn't necessary.  Creativity/customization: There are tons of different ways to be creative and customize your character. You can make your own symbols, put said symbols on cars, clothes, etc. You can also change the looks/parts of the cars after unlocking the parts. You can even make music/theme songs. If you are a premium player, you are able to do more with the symbol creator, and able to own more things, but you can get by without it.  Matchmaking: From what I remember it kinda sucked. They changed it a few months before I quit playing and tried to match people by rank. Being a higher rank, I found it really difficult to get into a match. There were times when I repeatedly faced the same four or five people over and over. Not sure if they ever fixed this.  Frustration: Expect it.  What else.. what else.. hmmm....  Friends! Yes, definantly play with friends. It makes the game more bearable. Playing by yourself will probably cause you to get burnt out quickly.  Oh, one last thing. It used to be fun to just hang out with friends and horse around. Running eachother over, stunning/shooting eachother, etc., but they added an auto kick feature that kicks you for a bit after a certain number of team kills/stuns or damage. That ruined quite a bit of the fun.    Well, I guess that does it for the Serious-ish review!   So, now to what I really wanted to say:  So, you may already know that police (enforcers) get stun guns, like tazers and bean-bag rifles, to stun and arrest criminals. I got pretty good with those. They are extremely frustrating to the criminals, but that was not why I used them. They were hard to use, risky, and caused me a lot of deaths. People don't stay down forever you know. But eventually I unlocked the crowning jewel of the Non-Leathal weaponry. The Non-Leathal Grenade Launcher. Oh boy, those were the days. Me and a bright orange grenade launcher stunning and arresting anyone and everyone that I could find. Good times. And yes, I was *that* guy, lol.
199	1	a	It's an awesome game, best played with friends i really like it to be honest. It's not that bad
201	1	a	Hi,  Well it's been a while i've been playing this game as you can see..  In a resume.  A quick word about the community : You'll venture into different personnality  Some that you will have never thought to be friend with or that you would have never thought they would led you a chance to be friend with them ;  Others that you will regret having known;  Some that you will love with the deepest of your heart;  Be pleasant to others and they'll be pleasant to you otherwise if you're an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it will just ends up in like any other online videogames and you'll be ignored like a ghost.  -Gameplay-  A gameplay that you will never be able to experience anywhere else. Why?   Well there's a maximum of possibility to be done within this game. The possibilities of what you are capable of are the limits of your consciousness.  The character customization : you can make your own tattoos apply them where ever you want. You can decide to look like a brocoli with a green afro and a green skin tone by example.  Vehicle customization : Apply decals where ever it's possible in your field of view. Make it unique differ from the default style that you'll see in game. Make yourself noticeable while driving in the most well made customization. It takes patience but afterward you'll be rewarded for your efforts with positive comments in team chat while in a mission or group chat with your new friends you'll have created.  Clothing customization : Same as the others above..i've seen and met a lot of great artists in this game. Be kind with them they are argued and rushed by others to make requests and they'll get tired overall if you're abusing of them but other then that many of them are the most greatest persons i've ever seen in this game. Pleasant to talk with them.  Many variant driving style : Most of all the vehicles you'll drive in this game as a unique handling with time you'll get to know every of them and be drifting around with style dodging rockets of your enemies perfectly etc etc.  Combats: I've learned over time that you need to act wisely as you move towards your enemies. Detect their positions move with awarness of where they could possibly come from. Be prepared paranoy if you have to but not too much. Call their positions to your team it helps a lot.  Every players as a different style to attack their ennemies i'm the kinda guy to be sneaky.  You have an enormous amount of weapon possibilities in this game. You'll have to learn the time to kill of each of them. The time it takes to recuperate your bloom and so on you know where i'm going with that..  Overall with the game my experience :  I've appreciated every minutes that i've passed in this game i will never regret and will never be losing any of the good memories i had with any of you that might be reading this. No one will be forgotten for those that i loved and shared the most grateful gaming session of my first Online gaming experience. So many good memories..so many laughs..   This game is printed as a good souvenir in my memory for the rest of my life sadly haha.. ;)  Oh btw every games can get through issues but i'm glad of the efforts that the staff did to resolve them in an order of priorities because they have a list of priorities that can be more important to respect in order to stabilize the game to make it suitable.   I was glad to be a volunteer for this game as a Open Beta Tester for APB:Reloaded; APB:R Forum moderator &amp; San Paro City Tester. For the time it lasted.  I recommend this game.  Have fun and hold on might be rough as you start but with time you'll eventually get better unless it's not your priority and you're just looking for a good time.  iHope you enjoy this game as i did.   &lt;3
203	1	a	All Points Hackerchet: The Reckoning
205	1	a	+ It's a good game, graphics are amazing and it's multiplayer. - It's hard to drive and make actions. + Criminals makes easy cash - Enforcers steal your stuff to earn cash on it + Private Cars - Public vehicles can be stolen from you with the loot in + Free to play +++ BRUTAL multiplayer game with Constant action all the time  Rating: 7/10 Additional comment: The gameplay is awesome, I love this game. There are only 2 things that annoyes me: #1: Other people stealing your car if it's not private... #2: Enforcers busting you in action... They can easily catch you up if you don't have driving skills
207	1	a	lol i dont even need to talk about this aids
209	1	a	What I love about this game is that it is much more of out smarting your opponent than having a better gun. Even though sometimes guns can be over powered, most are balanced but easily better in certain situations. But with the proper team anything can be done. This game has it's glitches though and lag but nothing game breaking in my opinion. And hey it's free. If you do put money into it though it will reward your experience.  But the gameplay isn't the only thing that makes APB special. The customization is almost limitless. I've made several characters from movies (Batman, Iron Man, Captain America, Punisher, Superman etc.) and it's a lot of fun in my opinion. The customization is way beyond most games period. If not the best.  People are trying to fix some of the problems in the game as well. We'll be due for a new engine update soon, so hopefully that will fix most of the issues.  All in all this is my all time favorite MMO. Will you like it? I have no idea, but you should try it!
211	1	a	This Game isn't Bad,but to get Some Nice guns you're gonna Have to use the Money From your Pocket :/
213	1	a	Ok i have been playing this game for a few years, ill keep it simple, Game is full of (Rage) This game is based on color matchmaking which kinda ruined it, green,bronze,silver and gold. Golds going against silver and below is pretty unfair and can be furstraightin, matchmaking needs to be improved,new players never have an idea of what to do because tutorial needs to be improved as well. Game also needs more content like (Maps) (Missions) and (Cars) not weapons and contacts. people buying guns for $60 and getting #rekt by a free gun lel? Moral of the story the game has potential but no one is putting in enough effort.
215	1	a	APB: Reloaded, a game where Pay-to-win is not optional but mandatory. I have some good and bad points that I would like to share with you but first you may notice my hours on the game don't seem like I have much experience. I can assure you that I have been playing APB: Reloaded for over 3 years now.   Anyway, onto the good points, this game has a wide-range of customisation options for pretty much anything from weapons to cars and everything inbetween (Mostly just cars, characters and weapons though). The wide array of customisation is what seperates the GTA (Grand Theft Auto) styled game from others such as APB: Reloaded.  As for the game itself it has a sort of 'unique' fighting style as a shot from a weapon does the same damage to the foot as it would to the head which draws in a much more casual audience who would prefer this fast-paced massive open world of carnage and mayhem. There are all kinds of different weapons in APB; High Velocity, SMG's, Rifles, Stun guns, Pistols, LMG's and even High Explosive weapons featuring the OSMAW (RPG type weapon) and OPGL (Grenade Launcher). This open-world environment is ideal for the casual gamer who's looking to get a 'thrill' in playing something like GTA, just without the cost.  Anyway, this game can't be all good and fun. As mentioned in my first paragraph, the developers rely a lot more on the money in their pockets rather then upgrading the game a lot faster. APB: Reloaded is heavily pay-to-win which in the end forces you to hand over your money to get something a lot more powerful in-game.   With my personal experiences in APB, they have probably one of the worst Anti-Cheat systems around, also known as punkbuster. Random kicks on innocent players and one of the slowest anti-cheat detectors allows hackers to walk right into the game and play as they would a normal player.  This is where I end, I could go on and on about the bad things that happen in this game but I would prefer for you to try it out, and just a quick warning. It can get highly addictive, incredibly fast.
217	1	a	The game's customs is what makes it fun. The gameplay you have to have patience with your self and the game, cause if you dont you will get tired of it real quick. Other than that the game is MAD fun XDD
219	1	a	GAVNO game.I'll better play RS.
221	1	a	its nice but too much hackers
223	1	a	All Points Hackerchet: The Reckoning
225	1	a	If your computer doesn't have 8GB of RAM or more, don't bother installing APB. The constant FPS drops will only frustrate you as you die again and again because of them. Also, this game has an incredibly high learning curve. And don't let district chat fool you: There are not as many cheaters as you think (Maybe 1 or 2% of the population cheats, and teamwork can easily destroy them). Once you get good at this game, it becomes addictive, but the server issues can cause that addiction to break. Also, do not play alone. Get your friends in VOIP and the game becomes so much better.
227	1	a	Best game I have played in a long time!
229	1	a	Only PandaFeces plays this trash game.
231	1	a	Well, APB is third person. It is free to play. Amazing anti-cheat. Been banned 5 times for some reason. But don't worry, if you get banned, you can Email G1 customer support and they will help you a whole lot. If you have no luck with G1 support, use Punkbuster support. They will help you alot and tell you that you have been banned by Punkbuster services. After 2200 hours, you should have become the best player in your server. If not, then you should invest some of your hard-earned money into the ARMAS Marketplace where you can find weapons exactly the same as the contact weapons. You do not want to get good at this game. Trust me. When you get very skilled at this game, People will begin to hackusate you and you will get reported, and banned. This game is a awesome solid rank of 4.7/10, for its great ability to customize your character and vehicle, and the amazing community. Everybody in the community is so very nice after you beat them in a mission by saying 'Good game', and 'Damn, you scary. I will try harder next time'. Vote for this game in the polls at  MMOBomb.com   gg pce kid - Ficci
233	1	a	all the noobs who don't recommend it are just silver lowranks. Get gud or get rekt. Btw you first have to put like 200/300 moneys in this before you look cool, have awesome weapons and have a cool car.
235	1	a	Another fun PVP action game, their is plenty to do, if you can find it. Also, finding competent team mates is sometimes a problem. The community can be rather toxic, though never as bad as LOL or DOTA. 10/10 Wish this version of cops and robbers existed when I was a kid and had more free time.
237	1	a	If you ever want to play a game of 4 man squad base rolling out and hitting up on them fools. This will be the game for you. Also you get to create your own character and watch as it grow. But don't get too attach to the people who play in this game. There are alot of scammer and a lot of whom out to get what they want. Guns are buyable and also achieve through getting grind for ingame money and buy it on the ingame market. Its a fun 3rd person games to play for down time because its an open world. The method you use to win can be conventional/unconventional. You change guns and tactic accordingly to scenario.   This is a game for fast thinker and master mind tactician. Its like a chess. When all things come together.... its really is a games not to be missed.
239	1	a	!!!!!
241	1	a	It's decent. It's free. Anything you can buy, you can earn.
243	1	a	A very cool openworld shootergame with alot of costumization options (cars, death theme's, clothes,...). This game provides alot of weapons you can choose out. I playing this game for a while now and i'm still loving it! For beginners is it in the beginning of the game very frustrating that you gonna play against very good players. But when u play alot u will become good 2. :) (sorry for my bad english)
245	1	a	The game mechanics are good, but the best thing about it is how much idiotic fun it is with friends. A large part of the enjoyment comes from goofing off with friends and just not taking it seriously. I highly recommend this game if you want some good fun with your friends. And it's free, so you can't beat that.
247	1	a	Fun, And the custom designs of clothes and cars, never end. better playing in groups of friends
249	1	a	Dis game is alright, its not the best and have many problems but i still play it, cause i got potato sweg yup mhm =)
251	1	a	A very cool openworld shootergame with alot of costumization options (cars, death theme's, clothes,...). This game provides alot of weapons you can choose out.

253	1	a	It is not impossible to do well in this game without paying real $$, it is however very difficult. The only reason this game has not faded into obscurity is because it has a great customization suite that allows for your characters to truly be unique. The mechanics and gunplay are addicting but the issues with a competitive 3rd person perspective will occasionally leave you frustrated. GamersFirst really needs to reevaluate its monetization policy and look at maybe moving away from pay to win. Depending on the server you play on, script kiddies will be an issue, the game is 'free to play' which means you have people creating new accounts as soon as they get banned. Overall the game has its issues but for me its redeeming qualities outshine its issues. With all that said, this game is definitely not for everyone, but as it is free to play I recommend that everyone tries it out, this game could use a larger population. I have about 2000 hrs total playtime (before steam integration) and I can firmly say that its potential is being squandered by GamersFirst. IF changes come about, I could realistically see this game become a huge hit for more than the small number of people who play it nowadays.
255	1	a	Good game, lousy publishment/development team.
257	1	a	Very addicting game once you get to know how to play it. Everyone may not like it, because its difficult at first. There are some bugs/crashes, apart from that, great game (especially with friends). 9/10.
259	1	a	This game is awsome and people should play it for the folllowing reasons :  1 : Pure PvP makes you jump out of your seat and also breakes your mouse :'(  2 : awsome worled with a varity of places and varity of districts. 3 : cool graphiques and awsome sound tracks (not like GTA ) and the D audio is perfect. 4 : Your character, clothes, vehicles, and even your music may be customized to fit your playstyle. and about the bad things : 1 : Bad matchmaking puts you againest HARDCORE players . 2 : Lags even if u have a latancy of 40 ms.  3 : a game that will break your PC.
261	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. If you like Grand Theft Auto but want a straight PvP experience, this is for you. There are NPCs who give you missions, but the missions are all PvP. It's still fun to play alone when I have some time to kill, but it's a far better experience if you can partner up with at least one other person to help coordinate against your opposition.   A wide variety of mission objectives keeps things very interesting. It's rarely a situation of 'kill all the cops before they kill you.' Jacking cars, tagging walls, hacking satellite dishes, stealing people's organs for sale on the black market, bounties on high threat players, bombing buildings, mugging people, stealing and destroying evidence before it can get into a court, street racing, raiding electronics and jewelry stores, fencing the stolen goods, laundering money...it's crazy how much trouble you can cause!  Customization is awesome. You can apply custom graphics all over your car, your clothes, your body. People who don't like the in-game clothing options will often tattoo their own clothing designs right onto their characters' bodies. It makes for a really deep customization experience, and you'll regularly be turning your head to get a closer look at what cool customization someone else has come up with. It is amazing.  I have one complaint. This game is most definitely 'pay-to-win.' $40 of G1C (cash shop currency) gets you an amazing gun with amazing mods that eats through all other players easily. So if you usually spend $40 on a game you'll play for a couple hundred hours, go for that since you otherwise don't need to spend any money to play this game. People who spend money will often beat you no matter how skilled you become.   The cash shop has cheaper pay-to-win guns, but they expire after X number of days. The guns you buy with in-game money all expire after 10 days. Fortunately there's not much else to do with all the in-game money you accumulate so it doesn't really hurt.
263	1	a	With so many hours in the game, I decided that today I will give my conclusion about the game. As you might know, All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is an open-world MMO third person shooter in which two sides, the Enforcers and the Criminals are fighting for control over the city. In my entire gaming career, I haven't seen a game that offers this much customization. From creating symbols like camos, tattoos and logos, to fighting in districts such as Financial(a close quarters combat zone city) and Waterfront(a district mostly for snipers and such), APB Reloaded offers a great experience. Although, bare with me, there are some downsights such as: -Progression will take a long time. It's more like griding if you're the type of guy who cares for the level and the reward. In this case, if you want to spend some money, I recommend Premium. With Premium, you have around 90% more xp and money. -Another thing about Premium is that it allows you to add symbols to your body or clothes up to 50. With f2p, you can add only 3 symbols. -Matchmaking. Oh my god, the matchmaking...  Get ready to fight against maximum threat level enemies. This is still a major problem of the game, since launch. -Some weapons might be overpowered, but there are also weapons for f2p players that are op as well.   Overall, if you are willing to spend some money in the game, I definately recommend it. Playing with friends will bring a much better experince, as any multiplayer/co-op game.
265	1	a	50 Cent: Blood on the Sand
267	1	a	Woah gta 5 is pretty fun.
269	1	a	At First become addictive, but at the end you get over it.
271	1	a	Thee Age of All thee Points, of Bulletin. In of Reloaded.  In the land of Memorium, there once was a game which in it's early state, had brought itself shame.  And of that game, it came to die. But, it was reborn, and yet problems did apply.  At first there was happiness among the lands, the people danced, and typed their commands.  The played, they fought, and had their fun,  until Armas, G1's wretch, released the next gun.  Of their box, in of horror, did they spill: The unholy OP weapons and cheapo's will.  Cowards, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, brawlers, looter's filled the population. The games proper, way, and interest came to cessation.  For years, did the land rot, did the people die out, and did demons rise. Until as of recently, the new DEV's of a new age, began their apprise.   We've seen there wrath, and their wrong.  But perhaps now is the age of improvement ...  so that APB can once again be strong.   
273	1	a	APB Reloaded is pure competative PvP, if you don't like playing or is terrible at PvP and FPS, you will hate this game. This is a Free to Play game, that is also Pay to Win. Try this game and see if you like it.  I tried APB for a few hours over the years ( I actually also played this game some in beta before it was free2play) and realized it would not be a good game for just anyone.   It was sort of fun being a criminal, but as a cop, it is harder. You have a car driving game through the city streets filled with cars, people, sidewalk objects, all things that you can hit or miss depending on your driving skills.   The combat part is where it is unenjoyable, your success depends on your weapons, shooting skill and teamwork skills, but it seems all the players you meet in the game are better than you and have better weapons, or they have godlike shooting skills by hacking while using the best weapons. The combat part is unavoidable part of questing to level up and unlock new gear.   The veteran player community does not like noobs on their team, if u look like a noob, they kick you off team or leave team. If you are pugging with other noobs, you will lose most challenges. And the matchmaking is crap still.  The fashion creation part is sort of ok except you have to level up to unlock fashion parts too.  If you have real money to throw at this game then you can buy the best gear and look good playing.   The devs lately have added a new hacker protection system that might help stop hacking. Not sure if the Hacker protection system is working or just falsely banning people.   Play this free game at your own risk. Don't pay real money for this game.

275	1	a	played it for a bit..it was fun
277	1	a	'Fresh and New' free to play.  With a lot of free to play titles, people complain. Concidering that the title is free, I don't understand that.  Anyways, out of the limited time I played, it takes a longer then normal time to understand things. The tiny yet steap learning curve might make you uninstall it out of rage. Beyond that, APB is a reasonable F2P game.  Graphics can be scaled, and durring my time, AA was in beta (how, I do not know). Nothing to blow you out of the water, but solid attempt at reasonable graphics in a free title.  Would I give this a thumbs down? No way. Would it be a 'must play'? No. Is it horrible? No.   You have nothing to gain or loose by wasting a few hours on this -- or by not installing and playing.  6.5/10
279	1	a	nice gameplay
281	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game, but is extremely hard at the begining. It take quite some time to get used to game mechanics, teamplay, map and so on but once you are done with it, you will never stop playing. The game has huge potencial, limitless customizaton and tons of content. Thou some of it is buyable with real money only. But fortunatly the game is SKILL BASED. What means good teamplay or good skills can beat any gun, and you have plenty of good option to utilize your gameplay as you please.
283	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
285	1	a	Yo. I'm a real thug freal ma negros, and this game just brought about bad memories. One time I was flying around in my direct replica of my own personal drug dealing van and i saw this kid. his name was masterrapist59xXZeldaFanXx and he wasn't joking about his name. His knowledge of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Zelda was out of this world. But then it hit me: my friend's car. It broke both ma legs and then he honked his horn at me for hours and hours, but I refused to leave, for I am the dominant male. Then I went and begged mhy mommy for money so I could get a permanent gun. She said 'YOOOOO CUT IT' and stabbed me in the stomach for the second time this week.
287	1	a	its fun if you have friends to play with, but can be frustrating when the other team is 4 max rank golds tryhards on TS3 versus you and your friends or some ramdom casuals.
289	1	a	Best game I've ever played in my life. It felt weird, but then I realised it was just like GTA meets Habbo Hotel. Thx mum love u lots xxx
291	1	a	Very gud
293	1	a	Pros - Customizability. Yes there is a limit when you have a free acount when it comes to decals on cars and clothes but it is still a lot that you can fo.  - Getting together with friends. APB is quite a lot of fun with a lot of friends and you just mess around the entire time  -Gameplay. Even though many people find it repititive i still found it quite enjoyable to play and I think have logged something like 200/300 hours into this game.   Cons: -Terrible servers -Terrible developers  - Hackers. Hackers everywhere.
295	1	a	very good game and fun you can create your own man and disigne the car as you wish for amazing game
297	1	a	MEDIOCRE GAME BUT IT GIVES YOU FREEDOM WHICH CAUSES ANARCHY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THE POLICE. 6.66/10
299	1	a	It's pretty fun to play with friends for a little bit and then it often gets really boring. 7/10
301	1	a	Very well made has alot of customizations of characters and vehicles i like the game in general but 1 underlieing issue i find is the unbalance of pvp where law enforcement players choose exactly when to start pvp putting the criminal in a state of unplayability because if you occupy your attention on something else the player will 'turn on pvp' at that exact moment and gun you down without you even knowing what is going on. Basically you CANT PVP as a criminal freely against law enfocement players you are under there control all the time. IDK why they dont just make the pvp always on for all players why cant a criminal roll up on a law enforcemrent player and shoot freely? it is very unbalanced game because of it and it forces the criminal player to not be able to enjoy the game at all if a law enforcement player decides to follow them around and make there gameing expierience unenjoyable when the whole point in playing a video game is to have fun its illogical to make a game where a player that chooses 1 side is automatically disatvantaged and has to try to play the game at the 100% control of another random player.
303	1	a	Amazing game for a Free To Play
305	1	a	good game- very fun game to play with friends and to meat new ones...
307	1	a	Wow. This game is awesome. If you aren't aloud to play GTA, go to this.
309	1	a	10/5
311	1	a	They have improved it alot, the game is quite fun, not a game to play for too long in a row but its a game you would stick to for such a long time ^^ 
313	1	a	Do you like pay 2 win games? Do you love gambling your real money for op weapons? Do you LOVE companies that make the game worse every patch? Well If you do. You came to the right place.
315	1	a	If you want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up a town, this is how you do it in crappy style for free GTA action!
317	1	a	a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ amount of lagg hackers and unskilled team mates.. lots of stress and any they want your moneyfirst on this free to play ... tickets will not be reviwed and anwser by an computer bot.   Have fun in this great free to play from Reloaded Production.
319	1	a	Quite fun, but really hard pay-to-win game, so it destroys alot of play joy. Still fun to play though
321	1	a	i absolutely love this game
323	1	a	GTA meets the Sims (as far as character/vehicle customizations go). The has some age on it, but it never gets old driving around San Paro with your posse, doing drive-bys while blasting music from your car speakers. Go Enforcers!
325	1	a	At first glance, APB Reloaded seemed stagnant and dry, like the barren tundra of a retired â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'s once fertile ravine. The experience was shallow and the sense of accomplishment was too few and far between, leaving the uncertainty that a virgin feels after what may have been an instance of date â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ; could one even call that a victory at all?  Now, standing at the frontier of this outlaw's paradise, I find myself wondering : am I playing this game, or is this game playing me?
327	1	a	Always fun and really cool TRY IT
329	1	a	I am torn beetween love and hate for this game. (please note I am writing this at the time the trouble maker is op) this game has some great times and laughs but prepare your wallet and also this games engine is a pile of pissy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
331	1	a	Since its been a while i played this game i decided to give it a look again when fairfight got released. I found the game more enjoyable since the amount of cheaters had been halved meaning less bs like that, sadly there was no real new things to the game except the R255 what i was done with quite quickly. So for a f2p its actually a good game where you can put plenty of time into and have fun in with friends but i would not recommend buying things like weapons on the armas marketplace since you are just wasting your money, altough premium is a good thing to buy.   I will give this game a 6,5/10 so Yes i would recommend it
333	1	a	I have been playing APB reloaded on and off steam for a while. I will state the following:   PROS:   If you enjoy enhanced character customization and opposing enemy players in non-stop PVP this game is for you. The detail of character customization, Vehicle customization, Clothing retexture is abundant, Moreso than most MMO's I've ever played. atleast one server seems to be densely populated at all hours of the day, There are always players online. You get a fully customizable soundtrack to play from your vehicle. The open world crimes and witness events give the game play immersion.  CONS: There are hackers who use aimbot sometimes, Allthough most get banned with the new anti-cheat system some bypass it or return on a fresh account. When you're a low level in the bronze district as bronze threat level, Gold threat level players equipped with preimum gear will camp you and kill the crap out of you, you'll be lucky to last five seconds without being picked off after respawn in some matches. As far as the community is concerned, Like most MMOs or FPS's Such as Call of duty or WoW, Players can be really disrespectful via district chat or mic, predictably Some can be very cancerous and toxic with thier insults and PM's, These players are usually team killers and generally will try to bring down the whole team, Not that I care but people who aren't like me who aren't desensitized to it will. Not that i'm sure it matters in this type of game, But there is no RPG element to the game, You'd have to think, There are NPC interactions in this game verbal and physical, Mugging, Diolouge, Contacts, Mail from contacts. Why is there no NPC missions or PVE? I'd probably play this game A lot more if it did have an RPG element to it and Solo missions. Sometimes I don't want to PVP, the same routine kind of gets boring after a short wile.  Conclusion: Despite the cons, I'd still reccomend APB reloaded. After all it is ranked #1 in most top 10 character generation videos, I have a lot of fun doing open world crime or when on my enforcer arresting players who commit crimes. The game itself is more adult oriented and more to my level of prefrence, Something you rarely see at all in today's games.
335	1	a	the bestest ^^
337	1	a	This Game Is fun when you are playing with friends,Hackers get banned almost instantly i would say 8/10 
339	1	a	It's neat, I guess.
341	1	a	Fun game ,I play this all the time on and off and enjoy it . There are some player balance problems but overall if you not one who goes completely mental when you lose you will like it. very satisfying when you kill an elite player by hitting them with your car after they ve killed you 10 times.Loads of charater and veichle customisation as well.
343	1	a	Very gud
345	1	a	Pros - Customizability. Yes there is a limit when you have a free acount when it comes to decals on cars and clothes but it is still a lot that you can fo.  - Getting together with friends.

349	1	a	I would recommend this game as a FREE Wonnabie GTA Cops vs Robbers.  I must warn you though, this game like most MMO's has a lot of bugs, the most common of these is the 'General Protection Fault.  Other than that it is a Decent FREE game and it does have access to Premium Content if you desire it, such as exclusive vehicles etc.
351	1	a	very fun, its basically a f2p gta
353	1	a	its great its like gta but more epic FOR FREEEEEE
355	1	a	i love this game
357	1	a	I am R130 ENF and R70 CRIM, this game is pretty enjoyable for me because of the sheer customization. The reason I have stopped playing is because of CS:GO (Nothing to do with APB: Reloaded itself). There are so many interesting things you can do on this game, for example spamming WASD to run in a circle and evade bullets like Neo from the Matrix! Or using LTL (Less than Lethal) Grenade launchers to stun everyone for days! There are quite a few cars, and in all honesty, there is no point in playing this game whatsoever without a premium sub. If you're not an Artist like me, than don't fret, you can still find music and cars designed by others for a fee. It may be difficult for you to place yourself in this game, or to have fun if you do not have friends who PC game, but don't worry! There are many clans and groups that play that aren't hacking, and some of them are really friendly. :D  Anyways, this games Guns (and many other items) are timed, which isn't really a problem TBH (I did eventually buy permanent weapons over a span of 3 years), and you definitely feel the prestige of getting higher and higher level. My brother plays this as well, all he does is create music to sell. It's worked out very well for him, he can buy anything on the game he wants aside from Joker content.  All in all, I recommend playing this game at least long enough to get to R100, hopefully you'll have a good time and enjoy the game to it's fullest by then. :)
359	1	a	This game is a good one it does take some time to get better at it, but its very fun with friends
361	1	a	The only game that made me uninstall itself. 100/10 Would uninstall again.  Okay just kidding.  This game is great with customization and everything. But all I'm asking for is a little performance fix. Sure, I may need to upgrade but, they should work on the performance more. Rarely, the game runs smooth but most of the time, it's just like watching slideshows. The game stutters A LOT... at least for most of the players, of course. And these stutters made us an easy target. Then get whispered 'noob', 'f****** n00b', and all the different versions of calling people noobs. And that's most of the community. Seriously. Optimize this game. Or at least try to.. or whatever.  But I still recommend it to people who has a lot of ram. There's tons of options for customizing your character, your vehicle, your kill theme. The game is basically a little GTA and a little Saints Row mixed together. So check it out. Das it mane.
363	1	a	Nice game
365	1	a	APB:R is a mechanically solid game with amazing customization options -including an option to upload your own music and play it with an in-game radio, but it's seriously marred by punishing hardware demands and one of the worst communities not actually directly affiliated with an organized Hate Group.  APB:R's got a mean learning curve, too, and not just in terms of gun fighting. High skill players also know the city and it's many alleys, highways, ramps, and neighborhoods quite well, and being travel time efficient is one of the greatest advantages for completing missions. You'll need to know the weapons as well and that's also not a trivial task.  The setting's quite detailed as well and fairly intriguing. There's a lot going on in this tale of a city committing suicide to save it's life and it's told from many different perspectives by a few dozen well composed NPC's. Shame it's also not an ongoing story.  A word on microtransactions: there are quite a few of them, and more coming all the time. Much of it is exclusive, but usually cosmetically. If you don't care what your OCA or NTEC looks like, you can unlock -permanently- weapons that'll perform just about as well as anything that costs real money. In terms of what's 'necessary' Premium time nearly doubles your income and contact progression rate, and that'll really start to tell once you get deep into the game and start seeing max level 15 contacts.  And much as APB:R's servers look like a dumping ground for unwanted (and tragically unaborted) children get this straight: it's a business, not a public park. Servers cost money, money means selling stuff. Get over it, or uninstall.  APB:R has a real and an active hacker problem. The worst offenders are the Americans, so keep off the game during American holidays and afternoon hours. Fair Fight helps, but it's bad to the point of hacker cadres bragging about how they stay in APB:R just to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with the devs, and who can point you at all their favorite forums and programs.   In Global Chat -just ask.  (Here's a good unofficial metric: read through the comments for this game that accompany any dev announcement or piece of news. Assume half the people denying hacking are doing it themselves. Say that's about %10, 1 in 5x2.  Now go play, and remember that number when you realize that these folks are the most active players when you see a newly minted rank 80 burn through your entire team with an unmodded Joker rifle. Sure his K/A/D is 17-3-0, but he's 'just that good.' Especially with one of the worst weapons in the game*. So _pro_. That he's also driving a completely stock version of the basic free car also means nothing -he just decided to reroll.  So what's suspicious about an unbelievably expert player with a Gold skill ranking in a game built on long-term progression and customization who likes to use a completely basic gun and restart at random? And who apparently can track you through walls? Can make jumping max-range hits on targets behind 90% cover with a sniper rifle?  I sound salty; I am.  I've seen this scenario play itself out _dozens_ of times.  If APB:R finally succumbs I'll miss it because truly there isn't much like it anywhere.  But I won't wonder why.  I'm recommending APB:R because there is a lot to love, but it's drowning in a sewage sump of the worst people you can find online. And no mistake, 'drowning' is no exaggeration. The devs keep patching and updating slowly and regularly, but the handicap of it's unbelievably vile community must cripple the growth it needs to stay online. F2P is a great model that only works if new people show up to buy, and given few actual new players stick around and that there's an upcoming global server merge doesn't say to me that it'll survive if it doesn't find some effective solution to it's many gloating and vocal cancers.   There's a play engine upgrade coming (eventually) and that'll probably be the make-or-break point when the stresses of the (realistically) many implementation bugs makes players who didn't log in to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with someone else wonder if they've got the patience to deal with everything they don't like about APB:R showing up while everything they play it for is in a limbo of bugs and disconnections.  Bottom line: bring your A game and your thickest skin, and stay off the servers during weekends unless you bought better aimbots than the other guys.  *The Joker SR-15 is inferior to just about every other rifle in every way except these: RoF and magazine size. Critically rifles, not SMG's or AR's, don't have iron sights.  They're meant to be light marksman's weapons with above average per-round damage that do poorly at close range. Our friend being described above will be running and leaping as he hip-fires his weapon. That has no crosshairs and a deviation box the size of a baseball diamond. At max RoF. ... GG.
367	1	a	This game while being very entertaining to play with friends, it is better if you do. The servers are near empty almost 24/7 and the only people left are people who have EVERYTHING. If you intend to play this, get a squad of friends.
369	1	a	This Game is a Freaking Crash Course!!!! Go out with friends and destroy anyone who apposes ya! This game is very fun and pretty clean! HAVE FUN GAMERS!!!
371	1	a	Great game, terrible servers and bad hackers
373	1	a	Ballerest game I was a monkey and capped any honkey that stepped and everyone knew they would be capped
375	1	a	1) Its Free-To-Play 2) Its like GTA 3) But with your friends.
377	1	a	Very fun to play with friends. Alone it's not as fun but still it is. Being a nice change to other Free 2 play MMOs. There were alot of bugs in the earlier version but they are mostly fixed. New patches and updates are coming so the game won't get boring for a while. The game looks good and even with minium settings
379	1	a	One of the most entertaining games i have seen in years. lots to do, you can do missions with friends, or just mess around!
381	1	a	While not the best sandbox game around, APB Realoaded gives you a great online world for you to play in with your friends! The map list is a bit short at the moment but this can easily be fixed with updates. The Character creator also is very nice and has some depth to it, allowing you to make a really unique character. The microtransactions are a pain but they can easily be ignored. Weapons are also a pain as you can only buy them temporarily unless you spend real money but this also doesn't ruin gameplay, as the starting weapons are pretty good. Veichles also have a decent amount of customizeation, letting you put your own logos on and you alos use those same logos on your clothing or as tatoos!
383	1	a	This is one of the most fun games i have ever played!   But. This can get really annoying with all the hackers and players that are on the wrong server (Gold on Bronze and Silver). 
385	1	a	PROS: Cops vs Robbers Extreme Customization for Character Extreme Customization for Cars Lots of Guns Two Open World Maps Modifications that affect the player, cars and guns  CONS: New players at a disadvantage (need to unlock everything) Hitreg can sometimes be a problem Not enough players for fair balanced matches most of the time
387	1	a	It's pretty fun to play with friends for a little bit and then it often gets really boring. 7/10
389	1	a	A periodically over-the-top aggressive game but otherwise quite fun. It's a little hard to compare it to other games as for its mechanics in depth are quite diverse. Driving is sort of weird and could be compared to ice skating. Shooting in-game is pretty fun but yet again, hard to compare it to another game. Graphics are a bit out of date but hey, this game was made a while ago. Its freeroam and mission based PvP servers are nice while having servers with open PvP have their perks too  Unfortunately this is one of those P2P or P2W kind of games but its really fun gameplay no matter if you pay money or not.  All in all, I would suggest this game to anyway who likes choosing what side of the law they want to help (by help I mean shooting at people your told to shoot at.)
391	1	a	cool
393	1	a	First ever real F2P Shooter , u dont have to pay cash to enjoy the game , its all about skills and teamwork , 7.5/10 worth playing
395	1	a	Great game. Great F2P. People say its a pay to win game but just look in the guides to get free premium codes. Better than GTA in my opinion. So much customization.
397	1	a	just a 5 star action packed thirdperson shooter 
399	1	a	Very Fun game with others. Would recommend to play with a group of friends talking using skype,mumble etc.
401	1	a	If you like games similar to GTA Vice City you will love this game. In my oppinion APB reloaded is like the Grand Theft Auto games (GTA3 and after) except it has what we've always wanted, Multiplayer. Customize your character and cars and unlock/upgrade your guns through a level/rank system. I think its a great game and recommend it.
403	1	a	APB is the one game ive played that ive had as much fun winning in, its rewarding, satisfying on so many levels. But its also one of the most frustrating and cheater filled games you'll find. But since they added the new anti-cheat system called 'Fairfight' its been a severe change amongst the opposition you face. Most of the time its good fun and great players, but at many points during missions you will encounter people that are questionable at best. Its widely known that cheaters still exist within APB Reloaded and it doesnt feel like the developers are actually taking it as seriously as some would want.  The game itself is based highly on the Ingame Marketplace that you spend real life cash in to procure lifetime bonuses such as weaponry, vehicles, clothing and the infamous 'Joker boxes' that personaly i bought over a 100 of, and never got any good loot from. Supposedly the boxes have a chance to drop legendary weapons such as the even more infamous 'OCA Nano' machine pistol. Its the most overpowered weapon in the game as its capable of literally wiping the floor with enemy opposition up too 100 meters(The maximum sight range ingame) even at full auto(LoL)   But even with the problems that exist in the game its still one of the few games ive spent over 1000 hours playing and still play from time to time. Like previously stated, you arnt likely to find a game that is as satisfying to win in as in APB.  If the gameplay doesnt do everything for you there is the most advanced character customization existing so far in any kind of MMO's out there, and you can spend hour after hour just modifying, adding tattoos, painting cars, and not actually doing anything else.  8/10
405	1	a	Everything and more, best thirdperson online game what i am seen!!!!
407	1	a	one of the worst games I've ever played. there is nothing to do. you can't do anything in it. there's tdm and missions and you can wear clothes but if you are a girl you cannot wear certain pants.
409	1	a	this game is good exepct some of the things i would change the auto balance should be improved bigos sometimes they are a bit sucky
411	1	a	I'm going to go ahead and play the optimist on this one. Try it for a bit till you get mad at it, because you'll probably still get mad at it as you go on.   Though as you can probably see, i likely didn't miss much from when i stopped playing it.  As it was, I found myself having to go shirtless and run amok through the town, doing GTA like BS.  That was true to a point. If you were on a sever with low cops, you could go nuts. But on a populated server, you could just miss a turn and hit a store by accident and the player cops would be on you like flies on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  While i'm sure they rebalanced things, back then it was more advisable to kill yourself countless times than to fight back.  Anyway, again, try it for a week or two, get mad at it and wish you hadn't.
413	1	a	this game is great but when i start it half of the buildings dont load so its like an invisible maze 
415	1	a	it sometimes does the thing where it's enjoyable.
417	1	a	i consider this game better than gta
419	1	a	nice game is funy gl hf the cops are cool  Das spiel sit geil habt spaÃŸ und viel glÃ¼ck Bulle zu sein ist cool 
421	1	a	Its a pretty cool game if you look beyond all the technichal issues.
423	1	a	IT is a cool game   
425	1	a	It's nice game!
427	1	a	I...love...this...game... â™¥Forever my favzâ™¥
429	1	a	I was playing this game before it was on steam -.- Hipster.........â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' sexy game when you don't get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off with the ammount of absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t hackers.... :D
431	1	a	Really addicting. Its like GTA and Cops and Robbors just had a baby.
433	1	a	Trueley the Best game I ever played. It is not pay to win because you can play with the preset guns and kick â™¥â™¥â™¥. I have over 2500 hours because it so good
435	1	a	about the game: The good, the bad and the ugly  The good:  -there is no other game like it -its not pay2win,the most powerful weapons are free -awezome costumization of character, symbols and cars  The bad:  -HUGE skill diference between players (check notes at the end of the review) -every now and then a patch buffs a weapon that was not supposed to get buffed. -a few times missions needs balancing (drop points or timers will give an advantage to one of the teams)  The ugly:  -toxic community (not recommended for people that gets offended easly - might learn how to ignore toxic people if you survive enought in this game) (there is nice people, but the toxic people makes a lot of noise in this game) -its a third person shooter. it plays completely diferent from a first person shooter. so if you're used to CoD or CS, you will have to get used to a completely diferent kind of game.  Notes:  -it looks like g1 is working hard now to finish the engine upgrade - give them time. a lot of players are tired of waiting for it since it was announced some years ago, but they have now another company putting some pressure on them. also, it looks like they want to balance things out.  -in this game, you recibe a threat level (it indicates how good you play). green,bronze,silver and gold. you're put automatically inside a district that is supposed to gather players from the same threat level. for (reasons), this doesnt happend. silver district is full of golds and bronze district is full of silvers. this creates something interesting: 2 worlds. the bronze district, where bronze and silvers hang out, a more newbie friendly place to learn the game. and the silver district, full of silvers that likes to take a big challange and golds. the silver districts will be hell on earth for all new players, they will be put against very strong oposition and wont have any chance of winning. yet, silvers and golds of the bronze district wont be as good and strong as silvers of the silver district.  -the matchmaking system needs some work (its scheduled for rework after the engine update) it will work with whatever is on the district you're in. that means sometimes you will be fighting oposition way stronger than you, or way weaker than you. its something you have to get used to.  -because of newbies being put against veterans, 2 things happends: 1- people start thinking there are a lot of hackers in this game (false - if we put a silver in CS:GO against a global elite and dont tell him anything, he will think the global elite is hacking) and 2- it looks like the game is P2W (again, false - most powerful weapons are free. but old players like to have permanent nice looking weapons, so they buy one with real money. as they have a lot more experience, they will always win the gunfights, and the new players tend to blame the gun for that)  -you will need some patience to learn the game, its a diferent and unique kind of game. but if you know wich districts to be on your skill level, its a fun game, and worth it
437	1	a	APB Reloaded AKA Cancer simulator.  Reasons why cancer  1.Closets 2.Blatants 3.Tryhards 4.Lazy DEVS 5.Bad Servers 6.Broken Matchmaking 7.Broken Rank system 8.ATAC and other unbalaced weapons 9.Still waiting for new engine 10.Addictive as cocain 11.Flamers 12.Fair Fight dosen't work just saying
439	1	a	If saints row 2 and gta 3 had a baby 
441	1	a	Good but P2P
443	1	a	Your review cannot be empty
445	1	a	This is a great game, With the latest set of updates and monitoring of the servers you feel like your playing for fun and not to outdue questionable players. This game is a great catch if your looking for some serious customization of your ride, character and Weapons. Able to customize to your hearts delight with logos, paterns and the like, this is a fast paced game that brings out the best and worst in people. out of 5 stars i give it a 4
447	1	a	If you play this all day.....you need a live man!    PS:add me and i will play with you! XD  I need a live too. :/
449	1	a	This game is really fun and keeps me wanting to come back and play after months! That's what my friend told me, I wouldn't know though because I can't run it.
451	1	a	Very nice game ;D
453	1	a	Really Nice and Good TO play
455	1	a	APB Reloaded is a mass-multiplayer 'sorta open world' third person shooter/objective based game. I find it very fun in my opinion and even better when you're playing online with a good group of friends. The objectives vary, and I find them enjoyable as well as not too reptetative, the only problem I think this game has is that the enforcer role seems to be a little too OP when they are equiped with a tazer/stun gun. I know people counter this by stating that criminals do make money quicker, but I still think that the stun gun is rather unfair. However, this is just my opinion and someone else may feel differently towards it. But, if massive-multiplayer, online, third-person shooters sounds exciting to you, than this game is perfect.
457	1	a	u â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s better play this cus its dope hell â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ weed watermelon whitewomen friedchicken!!!!!!!!!!!!!
459	1	a	awsome 
461	1	a	this game is good get it now 
463	1	a	the game is messing upits not letting me in i press play game it dont play whats going on
465	1	a	Get this game
467	1	a	Very much like GTA, but less realistic
469	1	a	I love this game, it reminds me a lot of the Saints Row games. If you like pvp and shooters I would recommend this one. I'm still VERY new to this game, I'm learning the basics at the moment but I play this game a lot. Its tons of fun!
471	1	a	the game is a fairly well made game, its being updated all the time, which is nice to an to a degree, sometimes you will be in the middle of playing and you will get a warning saying 'server shut down in 10 minutes' its quite annoying, although this is rare, it will happen to you. This is a grinding sort of game it can be really annoying, ive been playing for about six months and im only rank 128, max rank is 255... there is also many hackers in this game, moslty in American servers. (joker) how ever the Hong Kong server is very good about keeping it clean. (han) anyways, hope this helps, want more info? look for my cannel @ XenonGaming or follow me on twitter!!!
473	1	a	Dump trucks, just get one and drive them into things, it's like the main point of this game. JUST DO IT.
475	1	a	If you take your time and get used to the world and weapons you will do fine. Sure this game has a few hackers but so what? If you actually have some common sense and skill you can still beat them. I love this game! T ~ T
477	1	a	It may be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ some times but when it works it rocks! i love the game because of its beauty and potential. some people see a trash game without any good things in it. i see a unfinished game that can turn into a awesome game! may be kind of a pay to win game but that just means you gotta upgrade yo skillz!
479	1	a	i have had fun on this game but now it keeps crashing!!! i will try fix it but yeah...
481	1	a	Very good game. I think its excellent needs a decent computer to run tho only problem and it takes skill which i have.
483	1	a	Pretty Damn Good Game, Love It, Just Wish My PC Could Run It, BTW That's A Compliment, Good Graphics
485	1	a	Truely my favourite game, is pay to win and by that I mean that if you buy stuff for the game you have an advantage over the free to plays. In my own opinion this is better than GTA as this has much more play time and effort and customization. If I'm bored, I play APB. If I'm tired, frustrated or just feel like having fun I play APB. I LOVE APB.
487	1	a	One of my favorite free to play games.   Game is free to play action shooter. Playing feels like GTA but in multiplayer world with 2 teams war. You can play policeman or criminalist and fight together in missions around the city. You can customize your cars, characters, weapons, clothes and many other things. You can also level up your characters with missions. With money which you earn from missions you can buy cars, weapons, ammo, clothes, perks and a lot of other things depends on which level you are. As most of free to play games, this game is also 'pay to win'. Because it's free it also has a lot of hackers.  Developers are pretty active and they are constantly supporting and updating game. They have also improved anti cheat system.  I reccommend this game to everyone who like open world action shooter multiplayer games. It's free to play so grab it and try it because you won't lose nothing. Also playing with friends is really fun. 9/10
489	1	a	Been playing this for a long time and still I can't get bored. Better than GTA and right under Saints Row The Third. I love the overall story, customization, adding music and the deathmatch servers.
491	1	a	play this game its amazing with friends
493	1	a	This is still one of my favorit games on my Steam library and it is full of fun things to do (aside from the lag). you can customize allmost anything in the game and there is a large amount of guns and cars to use in game. Also there is a back story to the game (no one really reads anyways :/) but I have and it is not that bad, I say this game is a must get for the roll playing shooter type of people that like to customize alot.
495	1	a	I recommend it, no dirty stuff like GTA V. It's fun to play when your bored. Make new friends in it and play together. Invite your Steam Friends to play too!
497	1	a	110 hours of dump truck driving.
499	1	a	&gt; Dad gets this game  &gt; His 1.8k PC cant run this lmao
501	1	a	Really fun game, Especially with a group of buds
503	1	a	Rest In Piece no Australian servers.. Get about min. 200 ping. Otherwise it is a fun game ;_;
505	1	a	I never thought I would see A game where all characters look like young meth addicts...  Still fun to play though!  7/10
507	1	a	I haven't seen any toxic players yet because i have only played 2 hours xD the game is pretty bad optimized and servers are laggy but its still fun
509	1	a	It is good
511	1	a	People saying this game is pay 2 win are just extremely poor at the game. Sure some cars are expesnive. But who gives a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you always end up stealing a car on the street for the missions. Skins on the guns are useless. Some of the weapons are very good, but they can all be bought for ingame currency which isnt hard to get any of. Weapons are very balanced. Snipers arent overpowered at all.
513	1	a	ok here is what you need to know  When you are free to play player You Need...  Shooting skills TryHard on every misson (with pure weapons) FarmHard to buy 3 solted weapon  When you Pay for weapons You Need....  No shooting skills needed just close your eyes and hold the fire botton bam you rekt evry one  ________________________________________________________________________________   unbalanced weapons   normal sniper : slow your running speed / hard to aim / can't use it while on car Payed sniper : won't slow your running speed / you can 360 no scope with it / you can use it while on car  normal assault rifle : sooo hard to aim / rip on close ranges Payed assault rifle : soooooo easy to aim with / and guss what? it's smg as well  ________________________________________________________________________________  That things makes you quit the game so unfair  BUT : the idea of the game is so cool it's like free Gta V
515	1	a	Not bad, have to have a pretty good pc to play it though!
517	1	a	good game but the city is to small 
519	1	a	If you didn't get what you excepted from GTA Online. This game is freaking perfect for you. It's way much better than GTA Online. First of all, It's open world in a server for 90 players. There are 5 different maps(excluding special maps for special days). There are so many online things you can do in the offline mod of GTA series. You should definitely give it a shot.
521	1	a	This Game Is Amazing! Although I wish I Could have like 40 fps. I walk around with 6-13 fps :|
523	1	a	highly addictive and heaps of fun with friends i defs recommend it to ppl looking for laughs
525	1	a	Great game that requires alot of skill, Its a amazing game if you don't worry about a hacker here and there and dieing some! :D
527	1	a	Probably one of my top 5 favorite MMORPGs. I played it back before it became 'Reloaded'. Simply has all the features a MMORPG needs. THEN IT ADDS GUNS! It is a TAD bit repetitive though. Only complaint. I would place it in the top 20 all-time-best list.
529	1	a	An excellent game with a variety of weapons and customizaion. It's fun when playing with friends, but brace yourself for a community worse than CoD.  This game is an excellent addition to your library, and fun to it's full extent when in a group of friends.
531	1	a	Very good game and EPIC!!!
533	1	a	Best F2P shooter out there. Tons of content, and Micro Transactions aren't needed to survive.
535	1	a	Its a great game but please fix the lag in the game its really annoying that might help being more players in the game 
537	1	a	Its good for making people cry hacks and call you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ &lt;3 but you can make gud friends if your lucky.      Lag Simulator 2013
539	1	a	itz awesome and u get to do allot of awesome things....If ur a fan of comps and robers then this is the game for u :D  
541	1	a	This game is great i love it &gt;D
543	1	a	This is a F2P game that has withstood the test of time for me. Unparalleled shooter action as far as I'm concerned. Takes a lot of getting used to and not for the faint of heart.
545	1	a	Prety good game desipite some major flaws, like balancing, lag, and servers. Other than that very fun game and highly recomend!
547	1	a	Spent a lot of money on it, then GTA V came out and this game died... It was fun while it lasted. Most customization ive ever seen in a game.
549	1	a	This game gave me cancer
551	1	a	Really Great Game because it has all things you need to do for example, Missions,Groups, etc
553	1	a	Really great game it's like a MMO of GTA where u can rank up costumize ur char,Clothing,Car everything truly recommend it to other people. And it's free to play!
555	1	a	So I decided I was going to get this game. Then I relized that I already owned it. oops.
557	1	a	best game ever I played in my life.. just needs some fixes with the driving lag.. and a Suggestion Why not add scope to snipers? 
559	1	a	I like this game For its Customisation ! and how you Are able To Roam in this game
561	1	a	APB Reloaded IS A GRAET GAME
563	1	a	This Game Is Awesome
565	1	a	PLEASE HELP ME MY GAME SHOWS THE SPLASH SCREEN THEN IT GOS AWAY AND DOESNT RUN!PLEASE HELP ME!
567	1	a	APB Reloaded is almost the free Grand Theft Auto Online but you can be a cop or crook so this game is very interesting to play so i would this game out of scale 10 9.5 out of 10
569	1	a	Like owning noobs and hearing people call you a hacker cause you can peak corners like Bond? Then this game is for you.
571	1	a	its an okay game but hard for new pepole
573	1	a	If you want a review listen to me. These people are the same creators as GTA. Can you stop posting unprofessional comments like '10/10 Barely Played it'. If you commented that wouldn't you have click the thumbs down button? You guys that thinks this game sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you guys. THIS GAME IS AWESOME! 1000/1000
575	1	a	Best game ever i played with friend
577	1	a	Its a great game. Except for the hackers. Get rid if the hackers completely, and it would be alot better.
579	1	a	( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
581	1	a	Good Games!
583	1	a	5 Years ago, I took a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ inï»¿ the woods and the deers just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing watched
585	1	a	Driving a garbage truck on top of a garbage truck on top of a garbage truck is the best thing you could ever do!
587	1	a	Best game ever made.... With some exeptions.
589	1	a	GTA meets the Sims (as far as character/vehicle customizations go). The has some age on it, but it never gets old driving around San Paro with your posse, doing drive-bys while blasting music from your car speakers. Go Enforcers!
591	1	a	OMG BEST GTA CLONE EVER GUYS (and girls) PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'!!Â£!Â£!$'$%
593	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO FAUHKOING AWESOME! TRY IT! LOVE IT!
595	1	a	Gives cancer faster than smoking
597	1	a	I sucked off Junior then he beat me with his OG Mudbone â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥..... -Landons Dream
599	1	a	This game will suck your 3-incher out of your mum's mouth. 8/10 sucks major chode #stillforfreedoe
601	1	a	Best Free2Play Game ;)
603	1	a	fun game and it's free plus people just to let ya'll know it's preety much a pay to play cause most of the weapons u have to buy with real money and if u don't most would be like 10 or 90 days that u can have it soo yea theres that just play it
605	1	a	another great game destroyed by hackers
607	1	a	Its a pretty cool game if you look beyond all the technichal issues.
609	1	a	It's nice game!
611	1	a	It's where you become a sexy hot Hooker with a gun and you can give people virtual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s and jack people off then taze people in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ until they give you virtual money then become a Mexican drug dealer and drive your car off a building while masturbating to your character or be a citizen and constantly get rammed, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,robbed,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ON, and murdered  (This was copied from the scrub lord mark)
613	1	a	cool game
615	1	a	Beautiful game, it starts slow as getting used to it is quite dificult, much more with all the other experienced players. Essetialy, it's a GTA like game, online-only, with much more to do in terms of missions sadly not in terms of interactivity. Still I recommend you all play this, puT some time into it and you'll start winning, guides also help, you should also take in mind lag is part of the game, driving is also horrible and some weapons are completely useless whilst others amazing so make sure to spend your money wisely, my top picks for starter weapons, if you really wanna get kills, would be the colby-smg (for close to mid quarters) and the H-NVR 7 (a 2 hit kill sniper), if you know how to tap fire but an N-tec, they're really good once you know how to use it! Remember the tutorials always help!
617	1	a	PRO:  -Customization like u never seen before for you char, vehicles, songs, etc...  -Not p2w: after 2k hours on it i can say u that is not p2w at all... Everything u can buy from the shop is just for incrase ur appearence. All the weapons from armas are a re-skin from the ones u can buy from NPCs wich means that the weapons from shop are just a re skinned from the 'free ones'.  -NO CHEATERS: the cheaters are very rare and they are always low levels becouse they get banned within 2 days. When u meet a player lvl 100+ that is kicking ur â™¥â™¥â™¥, it just means you are playing against a skilled guy.  -SKILL: everything that you require to kick asses in this game is SKILL wich is something that the shop can't sell. When u get skills and u start kicking â™¥â™¥â™¥ u will feel the fun.  CONS  -PLAYERS: some skilled players that get tired of being kicked in the butt by even more skilled players than them, they decide to join newbies server just becouse they feel sad so they want to kick someone's â™¥â™¥â™¥ just as their was.  -ADMINS: WHERE THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ARE THE ADMINS IN THIS GAME ? i wish that i see some admins that travel trought servers just for making people calm down and stop the rage and flame in the chat. When and admin join a server (very rare) every player get exited and act like the admin is a 'god'.  -LANGUAGE: racism, cyber bullying, rage, etc... Sometimes that happens to being flamed or just to read very bad words in the server chat... in many languages...   BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS A BEAUTIFUL GAME THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF... I WOULD CHANGE MANY STUFF IN THIS GAME, BUT I'M A PLAYER AND NOBODY GIVES A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ABOUT MY WORDS.  SOMETIMES U WOULD LOVE THIS GAME FOR THE FEELING IT GIVES WHEN U KICK PEOPLE'S â™¥â™¥â™¥... BUT SOMETIMES IT GIVES U A VERY HARD TIME WHEN PEOPLE KICK YOURS.
619	1	a	A great game with endless customization.
621	1	a	It's really fun when you get a bunch of friends to play with you. But if you don't, it's only meh.
623	1	a	IT is a cool game   
625	1	a	If you play this all day.....you need a live man!    PS:add me and i will play with you! XD  I need a live too. :/
627	1	a	Well, the game pretty good it's been updated a lot. But my friend lost about $300 on the game. And it's pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when trading..
629	1	a	Really Nice and Good TO play
631	1	a	Really great but HARD game, you have to play a hundred hours to be really good and enjoy the game.
633	1	a	its an amazing experience.
635	1	a	it was gta 5 online for a long time then gta 5 online came out
637	1	a	this game rocks
639	1	a	Very fun game,especially if you're in a clan of cool people.It has some cons though: -Servers usually lagging -Some hackers -Really hard to get into especially if you're alone,it is NOT an easy game  But it has lots of cool features: -Big maps with detailed environnements and a feeling of living city (with players+npcs) -A looooot of weapons you can get -Not p2w at all,you can beat a premium or legendary gun user with a free gun -A quite good community (of course there are some idiots but its a minority)ready to help most of the time  YES,i recommend this game,if you're ready to get into,do it,its free! :)
641	1	a	GTA without the GTA price.
643	1	a	the developers are awful and the game is in a state of never-ending decay.
645	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO FAUHKOING AWESOME! TRY IT! LOVE IT!
647	1	a	Amazing game.  This game is like the old version of saints row 2 meets GTA Online and a whole â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton of crack (and stealing)
649	1	a	Great Game, a FEW!!! back hackers though, still a fun and game i would highly recomend to try or even to get addicted to!
651	1	a	Cool.
653	1	a	Its a great game. Except for the hackers. Get rid if the hackers completely, and it would be alot better.
655	1	a	Honestly a overall good game only current issue is the players otherwise this game needs some new players so dont rage keep playing and you'll see you can have fun in the end
657	1	a	No engine updates and cheaters, game is quite great tho, shame see such potential go to waste. But still recommend it.
659	1	a	I still love this game. You should too
661	1	a	the game is messing upits not letting me in i press play game it dont play whats going on
663	1	a	about the game: The good, the bad and the ugly  The good:  -there is no other game like it -its not pay2win,the most powerful weapons are free -awezome costumization of character, symbols and cars  The bad:  -HUGE skill diference between players (check notes at the end of the review) -every now and then a patch buffs a weapon that was not supposed to get buffed. -a few times missions needs balancing (drop points or timers will give an advantage to one of the teams)  The ugly:  -toxic community (not recommended for people that gets offended easly - might learn how to ignore toxic people if you survive enought in this game) (there is nice people, but the toxic people makes a lot of noise in this game) -its a third person shooter. it plays completely diferent from a first person shooter. so if you're used to CoD or CS, you will have to get used to a completely diferent kind of game.  Notes:  -it looks like g1 is working hard now to finish the engine upgrade - give them time. a lot of players are tired of waiting for it since it was announced some years ago, but they have now another company putting some pressure on them. also, it looks like they want to balance things out.  -in this game, you recibe a threat level (it indicates how good you play). green,bronze,silver and gold. you're put automatically inside a district that is supposed to gather players from the same threat level. for (reasons), this doesnt happend. silver district is full of golds and bronze district is full of silvers. this creates something interesting: 2 worlds. the bronze district, where bronze and silvers hang out, a more newbie friendly place to learn the game. and the silver district, full of silvers that likes to take a big challange and golds. the silver districts will be hell on earth for all new players, they will be put against very strong oposition and wont have any chance of winning. yet, silvers and golds of the bronze district wont be as good and strong as silvers of the silver district.  -the matchmaking system needs some work (its scheduled for rework after the engine update) it will work with whatever is on the district you're in. that means sometimes you will be fighting oposition way stronger than you, or way weaker than you. its something you have to get used to.  -because of newbies being put against veterans, 2 things happends: 1- people start thinking there are a lot of hackers in this game (false - if we put a silver in CS:GO against a global elite and dont tell him anything, he will think the global elite is hacking) and 2- it looks like the game is P2W (again, false - most powerful weapons are free. but old players like to have permanent nice looking weapons, so they buy one with real money. as they have a lot more experience, they will always win the gunfights, and the new players tend to blame the gun for that)  -you will need some patience to learn the game, its a diferent and unique kind of game. but if you know wich districts to be on your skill level, its a fun game, and worth it
665	1	a	BEST GAME EVER! love it love it love it! both customization, fighting. everything 
667	1	a	It's nice game!
669	1	a	this game rocks
671	1	a	IF you're willing to deal with the bugs, the lag, and the hackers, THEN this is decent free-to-play version of multiplayer cops and robbers.  Until the servers are upgraded, and the serve-side FPS and other such issues are completely ironed out, it will always be a slightly enjoyable, rage-building experience.
673	1	a	I Didn't Choose The Thug Life, The Thug Life Chose Me.
675	1	a	So much wasted potential, but still such a gem of a game. If you can get past the flaws it's an amazing game. The customization is unrivaled, character, clothing, cars, graffiti, and minor gun skinning. I personally enjoy the combat system. There are quite a few guns to choose from and each performs well within its niche, and the most of the 'pay to win' guns are re-skins of in-game unlockables.  System reqs:    You can play this game alright on a dual core with 4-6 gb of ram and a 1gb video card, but your experience will suffer greatly. My personal reccomendation: Quad code cpu 8gb ram 2gb or greater gpu 64 bit OS -my build for reference-    i5-3570k @ 4.5 ghz 8 Gb ddr3 @ 1866 Nvidia GTX 660 DCU II       I'm going to go ahead and insert my  tl;dr  here.  Good game overall. Small problem with hackers, free game.. (more than you know, less than you think). Customization makes this game a  must try .      Contd...  There are only two 'large' scale mission maps, they've been around since day one. Though it does get old, they really are great maps. Some mission locations can be one sided, but the overall feel of them is balanced. Now, on to the fight club maps. There are three total 'Fight Club' maps, with only two of them being active. Baylan Shipping and Storage is a small-mid size map with lots of high vantages and low cover. This map is great for any class, but is usually dominated by snipers. Asylum, it finally happened.. Asylum was originally supposed to be a kind of faction specific social district... long story. Asylum is technically still being developed for a yet to be released game-mode, but is an amazing indoors close-quarter to mid-range combat map. Then there's Beacon, the inactive map. Beacon was originally released with Baylan, but was temporarily de-activated in favor of Asylum. Nobody knows if or when it will come back, but it's mainly a close-quarters pointman map. Finally, there's Social District. Social is, as in many games, separate experience from the other districts. There are often many public conversations and arguments going on at once, some with roots going back to closed beta. Beyond that are the customization booths. There are booths for writing your own songs, writing your own death theme your vanquished opponent will hear, customizing symbols (for many purposes), vehicle customization (uses symbols), and character customization (can use symbols). There is also an in-game marketplace where players can sell their custom creations to others. That's as long-winded as I can handle tonight. Maybe one day I'll revise it.  
677	1	a	Very much like GTA, but less realistic
679	1	a	APB Reloaded IS A GRAET GAME
681	1	a	I love this game, it reminds me a lot of the Saints Row games. If you like pvp and shooters I would recommend this one. I'm still VERY new to this game, I'm learning the basics at the moment but I play this game a lot. Its tons of fun!
683	1	a	Get this game
685	1	a	GTA V for pc but better... and it's free :D
687	1	a	Really good game, has a great engine and gameplay, by the way the customization is like any other simply perfect, i love it :D
689	1	a	BEST GAME FTW   i like this game a lot playing it no life because i cant stop. i have to many fun in this game   only thing is steam acthviements or something like that doesn't work for me so i got only one its glitch but np   I RECOMMEND THIS GAME
691	1	a	This game is really fun and keeps me wanting to come back and play after months! That's what my friend told me, I wouldn't know though because I can't run it.
693	1	a	Great Game!
695	1	a	I couldn't wait to play this game, but once I downloaded it and installed it I would run it anndddddd It would freeze... I would ley it load.. And Load.... And load..... AND LOAD..... Still nothing.... It says I have about 72 hours on game but I think it glitched out something... Trying to reinstall it to see if it makes a difference. If it does I will change my review!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~EDIT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I finally got around to building a 64 bit machine, so! I found the game CAN Work properly with a couple of tweeks!  Pros: Very fun, good storyline, lots of things to do in the multiplayer, free. Cons: Lots of hackers online, Lag issues, Nothing else more... I really enjoy this game, now.
697	1	a	Quite good game, alot to do!
699	1	a	fun game to play whit friend's it's a mmorpg and you are alway's online.. awesome
701	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great multiplayer game with lots of chaotic fun. Grab some friends and jump in if you like third-person shooters without a cover system and open worlds like GTA.
703	1	a	come play that massive multiplayer online game with alot of jerks 
705	1	a	It sucked back then, and it sucks NOW, TOO. 
707	1	a	This is a must! The best action mmo game i've ever tryed. Try it! :D You can fully customize your player and vehicle etc.. Of course there is some bugs and annoying players. But it's a great game! Try it. i've spend many hours on this! :p
709	1	a	I have played APB:Reloaded for 4 years total with 2920 hours in game (i dont use steam a whole ton hence ~1k hours.) Great game, great customization. Completely free to play, there is 0 PTW at all. Premium only gives benefits to customization, and aftermatch bonuses. Everything on ARMAS is reskins, early progression, weapon skins, and clothing and vehicle kits. Weapons are well balanced within their niches. Its a little difficult to get a handle on when starting, but find some friends, join a clan, and it becomes a lot better! It has significantly gotten better with the implementation of FairFight (Don't believe most of the claims in chat that someone is 'cheating', most times they actually aren't), and seems that it will only get better.  I recommend this game to players who wish to challenge themselves, can easily learn from their mistakes, and learn from their enemies. As well as players who enjoy customizing their characters, as it has some of the best customization options I have seen in a game so far.  Game also uses a bit of Ram 8gb will do just fine, anything less will probably get frustrating.  See you in San Paro!
711	1	a	This game is Like GTA and Saint's Row it's a lot of fun if you like SR or GTA then you will Love APB i Recomment downloading this game and trying it out after all it is Free
713	1	a	I am terrible at this game, yet I can't stop playing 8/10 would fight agaisnt rocket spammers again 
715	1	a	This game is sooo close to what i can find an open world, trird person shooter, car jacking, and most of all custimization gotta love that. This game is clsoe to me having gta V, so what am i gonna do?  -Download  -think of the things i can do while it downloads  -when finsihes get hyped  -and play
717	1	a	One of the most addictive open-world games I've played in a really long time. APB is great fun and packed full of unlockable in-game material such as vehicles, clothes, weapons, and many others. Plenty of features to keep you occupied for a very long time. Best part: It's free. Highly recommended.
719	1	a	it is a little bit underated the game is fun if following like to make music, playing the game or make kickass art
721	1	a	Dump trucks, just get one and drive them into things, it's like the main point of this game. JUST DO IT.
723	1	a	Good game. Quite frustrating in the beginning but once you get the hang of it, quite fun.
725	1	a	lyrics: give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money give me that money
727	1	a	One of my favorite multiplayer games of all time. Even after almost 4 years I still enjoy it. And G1 is clearing out the closet hackers and all the new hackers pretty fast now. If the community would just clean up and be patient for the new engine, we've got ourself one hell of a game. The game isn't Pay2Win either. The default STAR is in the top 10 guns in the game due to its easy use. It's mainly skill, luck, and positioning. Take your time with this games immense learning curv, meet the positive community members, and have a blast with some friends while making new ones.
729	1	a	You should get this game! That is all...
731	1	a	I joined a place, I killed civs, got cops on me, robbed stores, this game is like gta  10/10
733	1	a	... 
735	1	a	I have played APB:Reloaded for 4 years total with 2920 hours in game (i dont use steam a whole ton hence ~1k hours.) Great game, great customization.

737	1	a	Hmmm. It's a Solid game. However... there a couple of things that disturb me. For instance, high level players on a certain level get access to what we would call a Rocket Launcher. And this gives them godly powers. If you have to battle against a high level like that you're doomed. Its so overpowered. Some weapons are overpowered aswell, it's not like really balanced.   However, im glad this game is not Pay2Win, you can pay for extra options like cars and stuff but its really like a short cut. If you play long enough you will get access to that gear aswell sooner or later.   Finally i want to mention how wonderful the customization is though. I wish more games had such awesome custonization. Because, you can customize all your clothes, guns, cars, tag and much, much more!  UPDATE [24-05-2013] APB is the Most Hateful community i know on the internet. You can't go around, playing, for 1 hour without getting called extremely bad names, cussing, rage or false accusations.   On top of that its full of cheaters with aimbots and wallhacks. Reloaded Productions however doesn't make ANY effort to punish these people. And the updates they are bringing lately are Sad, repetitive and overpriced. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you APB!
739	1	a	i really njoy playing this game, its so fun, good graphics, good gameplay, and its free...
741	1	a	it is a little bit underated the game is fun if following like to make music, playing the game or make kickass art

745	1	a	I found out about this game through my 'random links' method on Youtube (I click mindlessly untill something of interest pops up). It was a video made by a guy called Rapid99 titled 'A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions'         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  APB: Reloaded - A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions&nbsp;
747	1	a	 APB Reloaded Review
749	1	a	Its very fast pace for a game like this but still is fun!
751	1	a	Its OK
753	1	a	i havent played it bu ive seen my friends play it and i recommend you to play it its awesome! belive me :D thx! 
755	1	a	I played this game with 3 of my friends. All of us rage quitted atleast once.  Now my friends don't wanna play anymore :(  0/5 Pay to Win 5/5 Game 3/5 Overall After playing this game for so long, my doctor told me I'm a sadist.
757	1	a	Only real reason to play this game is the customization. Other then that, it's a broken piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that has potential to be a real good game.
759	1	a	It worth all the costs... 'cuz it's free :D
761	1	a	I Love Playing this game but the sad part is i dont own any credit cards and i want a weapon that i can have permantly have and not for rent because i hate renting things :P
763	1	a	Awsome game even tho they say that. Like gta lol. WHAT IS THE POINT OF BUYING GTA IF THIS IS FREE?!?!?!??!  good luck with the game  hope i dont do i thumbs down!  Thanks allways when im bored helps me alot.
765	1	a	very fun game, if you want somethingn like GTA this is the game for you.
767	1	a	I've tried it, but my pc cant run it. It looks fun though
769	1	a	Have you played GTA and like that sort of games? Then this is definitely something for you! Enforcers and criminals fight each other, choose your side, and play! - It's online :-)
771	1	a	One off my favorite games..  +great graphics  -Hackers -Smurfs yes thats a thingh -Overpowered weps  8/10 
773	1	a	Okay, so...I'll admit it right here and now: APB has it's perks. Customizable characters, cars, even creating your own theme song to play for the enemy when they get gunned down. You can steal cars from civilians whether you're a cop or a robber, and you're always wanting to get to the next place as fast as you can. This game does have it's problems, however: Shoddy hacking control means there is going to be a LOT of people using aimbots and 'legit' cheats, so expect to have several unfair matches, and even worse matches where you're against just really good people while your team sucks. There are some even worse balancing issues, with some guns being leagues better than others; but at least you will know which guns those are, since everyone will be using them. If you have patience, and can just look at the fun parts of this game...I heartily recommend you try it out for a little while; it takes some getting used to, but all in all, it's not all that bad of a game, since it's free...
775	1	a	gut game, i rate 5/7 p2w
777	1	a	cool
779	1	a	Drugged up saints row has sex with GTA...
781	1	a	It is very good game, but I don't like the method called 'PAY TO WIN' in it. The game is similar to the game series 'Grand Theft Auto' however apb is multiplayer and Free to Play Game. I really want you to try this game out. This game is taking a lot of time from you, because'When you get into the city there will be not way back!'
783	1	a	its just like grand theft auto games but for people who cant buy grand theft auto so yes i love it
785	1	a	You shoot people, you get money. You get money, you kill people! What else do you want?
787	1	a	
789	1	a	its good to me :3
791	1	a	This game is for the budding artists and kind of people who want to feel good about dominating other people.
793	1	a	
795	1	a	Free fun.  Even more fun when you spend some money on it.
797	1	a	this is one fun game it is like gta but an mmo or you could say it is like saints row with more people i love this game and it is free to play so go check it out 
799	1	a	Fun GTA-like game that you can play with friends.
801	1	a	Dance off simulator 2015   10/10
803	1	a	I would really recommend this game because it is very fun and very addicting. The game does have a few bugs and gliches in which the game might start to lag out or freeze completely but over all it is a very good game. A addicting and challenging one with a comptetitive twist. Game on.
805	1	a	This is an awesome game. It's one of those games where you can always come back to, and feel welcome back when you do. I have over 500 well spent hours in the game, either raging, creating, whooping â™¥â™¥â™¥, or just chilling with my online mates talking about the government or something stupid. There is a huge amount of freedom in the game. You start off with a car, gun, pistol, and one character mod. The start car also comes with a spawning becon, where you can spawn into a moving getaway car! Awesome right? It is a pay to win game though. Now with my amount of hours, you're probably thinking, I'm one of those payers? Well no, i wasnt all i baught was a car. But with practise, i started whooping â™¥â™¥â™¥ big time, pay to win players where raging at me. There was only one character I was afraid of, but unfortunately i cannot remember her name. All i know, is if you want to practise your aiming ablity, dont go sniper first, go N-tec. Definately a gun where you can whoop â™¥â™¥â™¥ with or without mods. You do need some processing power, pc and mind wise. Teamwork is key to beat anyone. Anyone with a good team, can beat a pay to win team.  A good strategy, and keep your eyes on the map. Avoid sprinting in close corners, you dont always have to right click aim, you can shoot from the hip, dont reload around enemys, switch to primary. Remember to always try flanking the oposing team. Shoot in small bursts, aka dont hold the trigger, constantly click it. It does help! I reccomend not having auto ready on, as some people need to get ammunition, different cars, see someone etc before a new mission. You dont have to mission for money, you can ramraid, or catch raiders.  If you need to know more, just ask me and dont uninstall EVER! Because i guarentee satifaction with the game. Its not easy to start off, but once your driving skills has increased. Reduction of lag, and you've gotten decent aim, or decent teamwork you will be loving it!  Always make sure you join a clan/guild on the game. The wurst thing about this game is playing alone. Always try to go with people who you know are like in missions so you always know the best thing to do in the mission for the win.   It's not about the kills, It's about winning, aka stealing kills, is fine! sounds like a dicky thing, but the better gamers are like more help the better!  I can't play the game anymore as i got my own pc now, and untill i get a motherboard that isnt made of stone, i wont be playing it, but untill then ill just be dreaming about coming back to this AWESOME GAME!!!!
807	1	a	PLEASE HELP ME MY GAME SHOWS THE SPLASH SCREEN THEN IT GOS AWAY AND DOESNT RUN!PLEASE HELP ME!
809	1	a	u love gta v but don't have enough money? apb is your answer :D it's an awesome 'cops and crocks 'game
811	1	a	I Just wish you could ride Horses.
813	1	a	APB Reloaded features a Grand Theft Auto style gameplay, but the description doesn't lie when it says HUGE customization! I have played this game for a while now and have noticed a few features this game has that weren't mentioned:  1) the symbol editor, it's a Black Ops type symbol creator from what I can tell. 25 shape limit for free players but I was able to make Lagann with it so it's not too bad. 2) there is a neat voice chat feature that has an area effect, this means that people can hear you better in the voice chat from closer up so it can make for some funny scenes! 3) work with either faction! I know that's obvious but I wanted to say either side you choose is fine! Make your decision on what missions you would rather do. What I can tell is that the clothing can be made from either faction. 4) when buying clothes, just go for what shape you want because you can edit anything as long as it isn't the stuff you have equipped when you start. Last but not least, check you email when you make an account because you might get some cool deals sent to your inbox! Heck, my characters in it are proof that as long as some one is human, they can be made in APB!
815	1	a	Just buy GTA.
817	1	a	it is cool
819	1	a	this game is like ebola when you get it noone wants to be near you    10/10 Would kill some zombies again - IGN
821	1	a	The community can be a bummer since it is filled with ragers :/  There used to be a lot of hackers but since G1 made a anticheat system there's not many left.  I recommend this game to people who likes Shooter games (But not FPS)
823	1	a	Cannot kill because everybody is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with pay to win. 10/10
825	1	a	Great game, dont know why everyone gives it thumbs down? me and my mate downloaded the game played it for 4 hours and loved every minute, personally i would reccomend being a cop :) 
827	1	a	A unique take on an open-world cops 'n robbers theme. Pretty fair business model, hard to master gameplay.  Easy team-ups and regular updates in holiday themes make this one a very fun co-op experience.  Edit : Playerbase dropped badly due to promises not held by devs.
829	1	a	Apb Reloaded is one of the Best Games,itÂ´s F2p but it has a BIg Fun Factor if you play it with some Friends or you are in a clan. You can Design the Craziest things if you are a good designer,nothing is Impossible in this Game. Apb Reloaded shows us, you must not pay for a Good Game !
831	1	a	gut game, i rate 5/7 p2w
833	1	a	the game is great but when i open it , it closes it self.
835	1	a	If you want a Grand Theft Auto type game, GET APB RELOADED. This game has amazing missions as a police storyline or as a gangstar storyline. If you think the Cops are the 'goodie-goodie' type, you thought wrong. The Cops also have the capability to beat up citizens, so they are definitely not to be overlooked. The gangstar storyline is your classic gangstar with the girls (or guys depending on your gender), the theft, the beating up, mugging. Massively Multiplayer. Action. FREE 2 PLAY. Get it while it lasts.
837	1	a	All around decent game, fun to play either good or bad. Plenty of people play it. PLENTY of mods, weapons, downloadable content etc. 10/10 IMO  Only downside is people who Aimbot or hack. Other then that its a good game, and its free.
839	1	a	Great Game with 2 sides to play :D You can play as a Criminal or as a Cop thats amazing :D
841	1	a	Apb Reloaded can be very similar to the drug industry. The product is addictive, it will ruin your life, drain your money and the makers/developers don't give a rats â™¥â™¥â™¥ about you.
843	1	a	I would have to say, deffinatly worth its price. unlike some other free games like warframe, its not nessicarily a buy to win game. and if u do buy, its a helluva lot more fun but whatever u do, buy this game! it's really great game, fun to play with friends, good gameplay but there are some minor tweaks like how many trillions of bullets it takes to kill, thats annoying but besides that its pretty fun. so if u don't have enough to buy GTA5 this is the next best thing so friend me if u want to play!
845	1	a	fashion police vs fashion thugs  10/10
847	1	a	Played this game alot, the game has alot of potential and is alot of fun, but the admins arent too sure of what they are doing :/  10 outta 10
849	1	a	Its very fast pace for a game like this but still is fun!
851	1	a	awsome 
853	1	a	Love this game, this game is fantastic :p
855	1	a	Still funny after 5 years gaming
857	1	a	great game without friends i spent about the first 8 hrs just figuring out the game before i got the handle on on it and it was really fun then i started playing it with my brother one of the best video game experiences ever for me
859	1	a	Ruined my life. 11/10 Would play again.
861	1	a	This is the game where I met my buttbuddy Junior. 10/10 Game of the Year every year. A real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥lapping experience-Some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ from IGN
863	1	a	The only masks available to my characters seem to be bags of garbage.
865	1	a	Totally awesome mmo that looks and feels like grand theft auto!  There are two diffrent sides! Enforcers and criminals.. I have only tried criminals..  as a criminal you are able to mug people and do ram thefts ( Smash cars into shop windows and sell what is behind the glass! )  There are also missions where you have to be in a team to complete it! 
867	1	a	I found out about this game through my 'random links' method on Youtube (I click mindlessly untill something of interest pops up). It was a video made by a guy called Rapid99 titled 'A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions'         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  APB: Reloaded - A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions&nbsp;
869	1	a	this game is great but when i start it half of the buildings dont load so its like an invisible maze 
871	1	a	This Is A Nice Game I HAvent Played it
873	1	a	a very nice game, and you can collect and group conflict.
875	1	a	This MMO is crazy fun. It's just massively multiplayer, cops vs. crimnals, Grand Theft Auto style ridiculousness. The in-game transactions are totally optional and not necessary. You can enjoy this game for hours upon hours for free.
877	1	a	i havent played it bu ive seen my friends play it and i recommend you to play it its awesome! belive me :D thx! 
879	1	a	the game is great but when i open it , it closes it self.
881	1	a	Its OK
883	1	a	the unistall works fine
885	1	a	Cool Game !
887	1	a	seems like a good game, although I haven't played enough to say. would recommend. 
889	1	a	the unistall works fine
891	1	a	If you didn't get what you excepted from GTA Online. This game is freaking perfect for you. It's way much better than GTA Online. First of all, It's open world in a server for 90 players. There are 5 different maps(excluding special maps for special days). There are so many online things you can do in the offline mod of GTA series. You should definitely give it a shot.
893	1	a	Great and unique game, lots of customization and cars / weaponry to suit everyones needs, fun mission objectives, almost no mission is the same in regards of what can happen, regular events and just alot to do overall. The downside is it hasn't recieved too many game changing updates in awhile other than the anti-cheat system but that's about to change with the engine update coming out awhile from now, which will make the developers have the ability of implimenting new content such as maps and game modes. It can also be somewhat difficult for new players considering the people with thousands of hours will basically demolish you in most scenarios, but given time you can learn.  (Also customization really only kicks in when you eirther get premium through events or purchase it with real money, which is rather unfortunate)  Summary: Solid game with great content and customization but limited unless you have premium and is also difficult to beginners.
895	1	a	This is a 3rd person shooter PVP based game with some very good customization options. There really is no PVE so don't try playing if you're looking for a co-op GTA type game. It's 100% PVP based.  The character customization is really good &amp; there is also an art kiosk to make your own designs.  This is what I made a while back when I last played.         The Hog Mobile&nbsp;
897	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME THIS GAME IS THE BEST I PLAY IT EVERYDAY I LOVE TO PLAY THIS GAME  give me creditz now plz
899	1	a	I freaking love it! lol. Great game but somtimes its hella laggy. But over all I recomend this game for people who like Saints Row and GTA. Its pretty much kinda like it but more like GTA and less like Saints Row.
901	1	a	Well to start. This game has so many cons yet too addicting.The Matchmaking system is broken and its almost unplayed for new players.I can say the community isent the best neither.In Missions your always getting out guned by R255 guys or What ever.The game pretty bad atm but still would give it a try. 9/11 
903	1	a	really awesome but high pc requirements... cant wait for the ps4 version to come out
905	1	a	Takes a while to get used to if you are new to the play style, but a tonne of fun once you do. However, this is only really a game that you should play with friends, Solo play is possible, but you are likely to get stomped, and just have less fun in general.
907	1	a	The anti cheat system is garbage, the developers are terrible and cant keep promises, they are money hungy, its taken them years to do the most simple task AND not to mention they dont really have any live support or anything so if you need help asap i have bad news for you. HOWEVER if you can get over this frustraiton and endless waiting for simple things its a great game, you customise pretty much everything yourself to your own ability, making your own clothes is easy peasy if you have the tallent. id say %50 %50 . you have to kinda be patient with this game... for years
909	1	a	Great game
911	1	a	Nice game , Nice dynamics , But the servers are crappy X_X
913	1	a	It's a good FTP game and all, but the devs are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.
915	1	a	A decent game , fun to play with friends 9/10
917	1	a	Great game but get ready to get ur â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ kicked. Many overpowered enemys. This game leads you to buy packs and stuff. HIGHLY RECCOMEND ONLY IF YOU PLAY WITH A FRIEND!
919	1	a	GTA but free
921	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot. All in all 8/10 imho.
923	1	a	This game is a difficult game to review. It's a very fun game to play, but it really does feel like a Pay 2 win type of affair. I have not spent money on the game so I should probably be on the other side of the fun fence, but not really. I hear constant stories about hackers but they are a rare case in my experience (Do not hold my experience as a standard, just a point of view). The criminals and enforcers differ in cosmetics only (except that enforcers have stun equipment which does feel incredibly cheap at times). Would I recommend this game? Barely. If anything I listed above sounds like a deterent for you then heed this game. But for me, it's free 2 play so there really isnt anything to lose.
925	1	a	It's free
927	1	a	This game is so much fun to play with your friends, make a gang, rob stores, or make a police patrol and kill bad guys, so nice and it's free !
929	1	a	Good Game 10/10  -Mugging People -Ram Shop -Good graphic -Cool Weapons -Cool Cars
931	1	a	Review written on 07/29/14:  I've been playing APB Reloaded since it was in Open Beta, back around late 2011. Since then, I've logged over 2,000 hours on my main character, who is a max rank gold, AgentRick (Enforcer, Joker East).  APB: Reloaded, like many other games, has it's ups and downs, but it's an extremely unique game that allows you to do so much more than any other game out there.  Let's look at customization first, since this is probably the most significant differentiator that APB: Reloaded has to offer. They have a detailed designer that allows you to make practically anything in-game utilizing tools and presets ranging from basic shapes, to gradients, and even masking tools to allow for cropping of symbols. If you're a premium player, you are able to customize your character and vehicle with unbelievable detail. My clan currently utilizes a Sheriff's Office theme and we have extremely detailed vehicles, uniforms, and logos.  Next, let's have a look at gameplay. The matchmaking system in place may not be the greatest at this current moment, but there is a visible effort on GamersFirst's part to tweak the matchmaking engine, and it's especially evident with the release of the Open Conflict districts. In comparison to Open Beta, the matchmaking system and the balance of mission objectives have come a long way. It's also evident that GamersFirst does focus on working out kinks in the system, as I personally worked with several GMs to eliminate the 'No-Witness-Zone' bug from the Waterfront Districts about a year ago.  Many people complain about the Armas Marketplace, but what they don't understand is that the Armas Marketplace, which allows you to purchase weapons, special clothing, special vehicles, and premium, is APB Reloadad's source of income. I have yet to see or hear an advertisement in APB: Reloaded from a real-world company that paid for it's logo to be placed in APB. (I have seen this in a number of other games)  The weapons that you can purchase in the Armas Marketplace, although some being unique and only available through Armas at this time, aren't very overpowered. Many people may not know this, but many of the Armas Weapons are simply permanent versions of existing weapons and reskins of existing weapons. Skill plays a MASSIVE role in APB: Reloaded, which many people fail to understand. Every weapon, Armas or not, has a specific purpose, some being more flexible than others.  If you are a brand new player, and don't purchase Armas Weapons right off the get-go, things may be slightly more difficult for you if you were to be put up against someone who has for instance. If you're willing to stick the hardship out for a short period of time, you'll find that you'll be unlocking weapons that are just as good, and as you develop your skills in the game, you'll learn tactics and gain proficiency with your favorite weapon(s).  I own an account-bound permanent weapon that people seem to complain about as being overpowered on a regular basis- the ACES Rifle. Although the ACES Rifle has a fast firing rate and decent range, it's not impossible to beat, as one of my own clanmates was able to take me down a number of times with his stock OCA. As I had mentioned above, APB is more of a skill-based game than anything, and typically whoever lands their shots, and lands the first shots, has a better chance at killing the other player, regardless of the weapon. Look at those (myself included) who have gone CQB with the PSR 'Harrier', (A reskin of the N-HVR 762) against someone using, say, an OCA. If I land my two shots before they land their 8 shots, they're dead. Thus, entering into the next section of this review, the community.  The community of players in APB: Reloaded are quite unique. You'll find that although there are a number of trolls and a quite a few sub-par players who will frequently smear and accuse good players of cheating, that you will meet some pretty nice people on APB. The troll and raging 12 year old population on APB isn't as significant as it is on games such as those from the Call of Duty series.  Being that I've logged over 2,000 hours on my primary character alone, I've seen quite a number of things happen in APB. I've also been accused of using some pretty ridiculous non-existent cheats in the game. (Such as increased weapon damage cheats, increased health cheats, etc.) Although this can be discouraging for skilled players, especially if/when you become questioned or reviewed by someone more important than a raging 12 year old, it certainly isn't a big enough deterrent not to play the game.  My biggest recommendations to any and all new players to APB are quite simple.  1) There are threat levels, identified by color. (Trainee/Green, Bronze, Silver, and Gold) The APB Districts are segregated by threat level, and players can play in servers equal to, or one below their threat level. If you are silver, play in bronze districts. Due to the fact that people don't normally populate gold districts, you'll see a lot of golds in the silver districts.  2) If you have a friend who got you into the game, and they're a gold player, ask them to make a reroll account to help you in the beginning. Trust me, grouping with a gold player when you're brand new is being thrown right into the fire, and it will only frustrate you and make you want to quit the game. This again goes back to number one, play with or below your threat level in the beginning.  3) Understand that there have been people who have been playing this game for a very long time and have a lot of experience playing it. Don't assume that because someone is better than you (especially if you're new for goodness sakes) that they must be hacking. Everyone, myself included, has players that are better than them in APB. It's a fact of life- accept this fact, and you'll enjoy the game a lot more.  4) Join a clan!!! There are plenty of clans out there in APB: Reloaded. If you want to make the best of your game experience, join a clan! Find a group of people who you can play with, have fun with, and who can teach you the ropes. It's much easier to play with an organized group and you're more likely to win your missions if you do so. (Teamwork and Communication are MASSIVE force multipliers in APB: Reloaded, as they are in just about every game. A well-organized team of silvers can easily defeat a non-organized team of golds of equal rank.)  5) Know that you can do things other than playing missions! Although a lot of experienced gold players play in the Fight Clubs, Fight Club is a great way for players to hone their skills. It may not be the best learning option in the beginning, but I promise if you play Fight Club for a day straight once you've got the basics of the game down, you'll learn A LOT!  If you start to get upset with missions or fight club, go to social district and talk to people. There are a number of quite funny people who hang around social. If you're a criminal, why not try your hand at ramraiding? It can be both relaxing and rewarding. If you're new, and you decide to ramraid, go to a LOW population server (I'm talking the lowest possible population with the closest match to your threat level.)  Be creative! Mess around in the designers. Make some symbols or themes. Look on youtube for some tutorials on how to use the editors and hone your skills at designing. That can make you a nice amount of money, and it's always pretty cool to see someone randomly driving down the street in a car you designed and sold!  6) Have fun with the game! If you like it, help support the game by getting premium. Even if you were to only purchase premium once, you'd have the ability to fully customize your clothes and vehicles, and they'll stay that way when your premium runs out.  Although I've had ups and downs in APB over the years, I'd definitely say that APB is a game worth picking up and playing for a while. What do you have to lose?
933	1	a	good game its a mix of gta and saints row in one free to play game
935	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community, got ran over by a civilian car, teabagging enemies and cancer gameplay. 10/10
937	1	a	Very nice game! Sometimes i imagine its like my second life :D However, sometimes it might get boring, but ill recommend it, cause its free 2 play :)
939	1	a	An enjoyable free-to-play game with a high level of customisation which can be rewarding at times. Have caution, however, as this game can be  highly  frustrating, and it's not without problems. To add to that, the devs seem to spend their time adding expensive paid content rather than fixing issues and bugs.   So, should you get it?  If you have some mates and are looking for a enjoyable casual gaming experience, then no. This game will make you rage! Download if you wanna get your competitive side on, but be prepared.
941	1	a	APB : R is a fully functional and versatile 3rd Person shooter. One can say that it's a Free to play but revamped version of Gta's Cop And Robbers.   You could be your own in design and music.   -Customizing your character to fit your own unique style. -Creating your own ingame music to listen to on the radio or as your death theme for your enemies that tread in our path. - And Using the tools in your arsenal in combat to destroy and rebuild. (*Repair Gun*)  To me because the game allows soo much that it has the possibility to become bigger than it already is, A new engine is coming out and possibilities are being unlocked. Don't get dragged behind, Gear up and be as awesome as you are today.  BECOME THE HERO SAN PARO DESERVES OR THE VILLIAN IT REGRETS . -Jam
943	1	a	If you like hackers, getting owned by people with more experience and bandits vs cops, then this game is for you.
945	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot. All in all 8/10 imho.
947	1	a	This is a great game to play with friends as the missions require teamwork but the missions can still be enjoyed by a single person. APB is a game that it is easy to mess around with and still earn (in game) money eaisly. For a F2P this game is balanced.
949	1	a	Welcome to APB Reloaded also got Hacker obv and no car when you need one &gt;_&lt;
951	1	a	really good game i highly recommend it
953	1	a	its a great game love it if you want a free GTA/sunset overdrive game you got it 
955	1	a	I played this game a lot everybody says that it is P2W but its not you can be better normal weapons,yeah the Premium thingy is a little bit P2W but you can solve it whit playing more highly recommding this game one of my favorite games (i didnt play on steam account thats why it only says 118 hrs on record)
957	1	a	A very good game, really fun if playied with your friends.  It's a bit complicated to understand when you're a newbie, just look for a veteran that will explain you ;)
959	1	a	sorry about the scar.
961	1	a	This game has a very high level of character and vehicle customization. You can be ANYONE and the game is pretty addicitng! :) Check it out
963	1	a	If you want to play a game like Grand Theft Auto V that is free, Play this awesome game!
965	1	a	I love shoving corn into my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
967	1	a	If you like the following then this game is for you: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ engines, OP â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, Terrible games, Slowly dieing games, Badly optimized games. 
969	1	a	What can be said about APB reloaded? A lot. I came from the orginal All points, which was a super fun game. This game sort of lives up to the orginal. Its fun, people are (sometimes) nice. Very well balanced at low levels. Customization  Pros: Customization (character/Cars) Weapons (tons) Driving Custom Decals Level system Rank system Group party Extra events Ram Raids (crimes) Faction choice  Cons: PTW golds Costly Perm weapons with extra damage Unbalanced game servers Reward to spend ratio low  Overall PTW -2 Fun +2 Customization +2 Weapons +2 Multiplayer +2 Money Ratios -2 funky gameplay -2  Overall 6/10. Not bad, not much of a free to play game.
971	1	a	really awesome but high pc requirements... cant wait for the ps4 version to come out
973	1	a	sorry about the scar.
975	1	a	APB reloaded is a great open world 3D Massively Multiplayer shooter. This game is great and I seriously recommend this game to vetern game players. The game has some negative things like Pay2Win assets that allows rich spoiled people to have everything they desire from a one hit kill assault rifle. To a 1 second reload rocket launcher with a radius of the base of the Pentagon. It also has much trouble with people 'Hacking' as some people call it. However its just a simple means of people downloading Aimbots for it and ruining everyones gaming experience. If this were to be No Pay2Win and you could buy this game for 5 USD. And have a decent ban system and anti 'Hack' system. It would be worth the 5 USD. 9/10 without Aimbotters.
977	1	a	The original APB was a game that I always wanted to play as it had some excellent ideas that seemed really promising. The game iteself however was plagued with hackers and bugs. It died on its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ rather soon after release, taking Realtime Worlds with it (no more crackdown :c ). What has this got to do with reloaded? Oh quite a bit. The game is now quite pay to win, with some guns only really available to people who pay the rough equivalent to a small island nation's GDP. The company who took ownership of APB, 'gamersfirst' have only started to get rid of some bugs that plagued the game since it was brought back and instead only really seemed to care about creating new 'premium' content instead of optimisation and stuff. The performance now is quite acceptable and as long as your pc isn't 32bit/very old/a laptop you should be able to run it. What really kills this game in terms of performance though is the servers. I don't know what potato they use to run their servers and internet, but it needs to be changed.  There are some bits that make it enjoyable though. One bit is the customisation, which is fantasic. The other bit is that if you play as a group you can have some fun annoying angry premium players, who will report you for hacking if you get more than three kills with the standard gun.   To conclude, I find this game incredibly easy to hate and wish for it to be put to death but at the same time I have many hours on it and its a laugh with friends to the point where I can almost overlook the half arsed job by gamersfirst.  IF THERE WAS A 'meh.' reccomendation I'd choose it :^)
979	1	a	GTA in a free2play way.
981	1	a	I would strongly reccomend this game for anyone who ever happened to play any of GTA games and liked it, but felt it lacks action and multiplayer, because that's exactly what this games has to offer. In this game you can choose to play either as a criminal or as an officer. It has an extremly long and hard leveling system that will keep you busy and has to offer a lot of vehicles, weapons and even clothes. More of than, it has almost unlimited customisation options for everything, starting from graffity and finishing with customisation of your personel vehicle.   Feel like it's time to take a break from your usial calm games and kick some â™¥â™¥â™¥? Than what are you waiting for? Download it and go for it!
983	1	a	G1 finally banning cheaters. Best game ever.
985	1	a	it em good wif frenz 
987	1	a	APB was good in the start, my best ever ping was 180, it went up to 500â†’1300 ping, saw one frame every few minutes, deleted 160 ranked account. Gave my friend 2 mill. Gave him 5 good vehicles. Oh, and a Nano. It is a very good game if your internet is good, although, it can get boring after u have basicly everything, which will take some time, if your internet is bad like mine.. Don't download it. But if u have a good internet and are bored most of the time, and have 1-3 friends to play APB with in your friendlist, it will be very fun. There are quite a few hackers + scammers. Beware.
989	1	a	Great game. You should try it :3
991	1	a	A fun game to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around in, nothing more. Better with friends, hell alone. Its a fun game and ok
993	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot. All in all 8/10 imho.
995	1	a	This game is bad. Not the room kind of bad with that classic cult feel or like those steam games you unironically enjoy for under $5 like runaway, nor even the LA Noire type of bad where everything is the just perfect â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥torm of cheesy that sucks you right in. No. This game is just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad. It's the kind of bad that just seeps into your pores and skin and constantly reminds you that while this game may have been free, it certaintly wasn't worth the piece of your soul for admission, even if the rampant free 2 play, awful controls and pedo vans won't haven't convinced you otherwise. In short: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game, it redesigned survival horror in ways Silent hill and resident evil could only wet dream about. 7.5/10 if only for the Richard Nixon mask. Would play again if drunk and forgot about the first time
997	1	a	fix the severe lag issues and it would be a lot better n.n
999	1	a	Steam is showing that i'm playing the game but actually i haven't played it for a week. Ty for the free hours.  Also customization is great 10/10
1001	1	a	&gt;log in &gt;spawn my car &gt;start driving &gt;que for a mission &gt;mission starts &gt;drive to the mission &gt;hit a Telephone pole &gt;car explodes and I die &gt;I rage quit 10\10 would do that again 
1003	1	a	APB Reloaded is a really great game, Soo many games out there yet all feel like we're all clones doing the samething over and over again. APB, doesn't have that feeling everyones different you'll never find someone that has the same look or style as you do. Imagine your favorite character from anything... well with APB being so free, you can make that said character in game. Don't let the reviews saying 'Oh its a Pay 2 Win game' change your mind about APB just about every game has in game purchases that's whats starting to happen everywhere(Lower dem Arma Prices Dow dat shiz cray).. It's the little things that make life even better with friends this game.. is one of those little things in a gamers life you won't RAGRET...Don't forget everyone gets a little upset when they die and may insult you after just make sure to WHISPER so you won't wake up the neighbors.. So download this game get in San Paro and kill some (Insert curse word here).. xP
1005	1	a	Piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1007	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game
1009	1	a	its a game 
1011	1	a	Majority of their consumer base (the ones that actually pay for stupid crap in this game) were cheaters.  They were all banned. Ha ha. Take that, Reloaded.
1013	1	a	This is an awesome game,but all you need to know that, -It wont be easy out there you new players -Dont rage quit -Have fun -Have fun more by playing with friend -Love your character -Ignore the people with the nazi symbol -Ignore the hcker
1015	1	a	Very cool game :D
1017	1	a	I feel like the only person who likes this game...
1019	1	a	This game is gay 
1021	1	a	I was bored and my brother told me to play this game and I was shock and it was fun and i'm new anyway so I think I will have alot fun on this ABP Reloaded. +1 for you owner/coowner/staff member thank you for making this game
1023	1	a	Hey guys, after a shÃ­tstorm of playtime I decided to give the community some of my toughts.  Obviously, we are talking about a game thats still alive after several years, and it has a reason, but I think this is about to be gone. Back in 2013 I stopped playing this game, and now in 2015 I gave it another go. I was dissappointed, not because it went worse or dead, it isnt. But there is no such new stuff that players were always dreaming of. More than a year gap, and I can say, nothing new, just some OP Armas Marketplace weapons, and a car kit. I was expecting at least a new vehicle, a roadmap, or at least hackers gone (and im not even that courageous to dream about a new district). Anyways, I hope once the server merge is done, devs will give attention to such a stuff like these, so now, I suggesting this game.  The pros: -Big community, you will always find buddies to play with, or get help. -Promo codes, I hope devs willing to keep provide them. -Open worlds with some gamemodes, and different servers for each (to make the matchmaker more fair). -Random and kinda colorful missions. Every mission is a different story. -Customization, including: music maker, car sound/kits/paint, Sims like character making+tattoos, and a lots of clothes...And this is the main point of the game, seriously, it has no pair. I would rather describe this game as a F2P art game with shooting possibilities. You can almost literally can customize everything, if you like designing, you will love this game. -Decent amount of perks/mods for cars/character/weapons, there is no best or worst set, everything depends on your playstyle. -Marketplace, where you can sell and show your badass stuff. Or buy. -Events. Make use of them, they are usually nice farming possibilities.  The cons: -Unbalanced weapons. Some of them that you can buy for real money, are obviously the way more powerful than those you can buy for in-game money, giving a p2w feeling. Still, you can try out some for free. -Server lags, not an usual problem, altough when it kicks in, you better just log off (I hope server merge will kill this). -Hackers. They will be always around with tasty aimbot and wallhack. FairFight is not enough to keep them away. -A lot of annoying no life as$holes, who like to harass others, even if they are on the same side. I just suggest ignore asap. -Weird car physics. They seem to be too slow and too heavy. -Designing possibilities are too limited with freemium account.  The two sided: -If you dont want to play missions, there is a possibility to hang around, race etc...That means of course, if you are on a mission, you still can get rammed and harassed by any other player. -Epic grinding. It keeps you playing, although without premium account its much harder to get money.  Tips for newbies: -Do the tutorial missions asap, look for the one that gives you a LIFETIME weapon. You will need it, you really dont want to re-buy your weapon every 10 days. -Spend some time at Social district and try out every editor. Also, thats the best place you can ask for help. -If you harassed by anyone 'superior' to you, just use '/report *name*' then '/ignore *name*', and if needed change instance. -Make sure you switched off auto-ready system, so you wont go on mission until you dont want. -Save money and joker tickets, dont spend them inmedetadly. -Always go for sure, check your ammo and grenades every time. -Just a performance tip, when you enter a district, take a trip from its end to the other, so most things will load, and you lower the chance of a performance lag.  I hope some of you can use it. If you have questions just ask. See you on battlefield!
1025	1	a	Ive been playing this game for years and i think its time to write a review.  Cons:  1.Toxic people, a ton of them. 2. Horrible servers. 3. Everything is too expensive on the Armas marketplace, i mean seriously, 20$ for a weapon thats a reskin of the base game item. 4. Matchmaking is horrible. 5. People take the game too seriously, they have to win every mission and hate people that do bad, its kinda pathetic.  Pros: 1.There are some good people in the toxic community. 2.Its pretty fun when you get used to the game, if you can handle the servers, that is. 3.The cars/customization options. 4.Same as 3, but with clothes and character customization.
1027	1	a	One of the best Free OpenWorld Multiplayer games :)) There must be more games like this one..!!
1029	1	a	Very good game, but owners are bad. It can be the most played game ever but G1( R.I.P.) Prepare yourself on server lags and fps drops. :)
1031	1	a	This game is truly amazing, but the only thing I hate is that it's hard to find police when you want to just mess around and not do missions, and you start off with very little (which isn't a problem). But everything else is great from the physics, the atmasphere, and others!
1033	1	a	APB:R Is a dynamic play style game. Some elements of the game include dynamic events (Like Witnessing Crimes for enforcers and mugging and ram raiding for criminals). The customization aspect of the game is incredible, you can make your own symbols using the editor or choose from a library of preset decals to place on your clothes or vehicles however you see fit. The gameplay is a mix of open combat and close quaters combat across foru different maps. Events are included like easter egg hunts around holidays like easter. If you like causing or stopping chaos or police roleplay you will like this game.
1035	1	a	Now that I have mashed 1.4k hours into this game, a review is probably necessary.   I would say this game is very fun, I started off as a crappy silver player and carried myself up to gold. The opponents may be hard but it's very fun and challenging.   Honestly, this is just a free to play version of GTA series where there are stupid bugs and glitches still in game. To be perfectly honest the game is great, if you were to spend about 60USD you will be able to play the game without having to buy guns every 10 days; basically a Pay to Win game.   Keep in mind that this is a Third Person Shooter game and although it has an anti-ban programme it really doesn't do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Also if you think people hack in this game, it just shows that you're very bad at APB :)  Note that this game is much more fun to play with your friends, as it has tactical values and teamwork necesseties in this god forsaken game.  Also Han is dead :)  Have fun
1037	1	a	Very good game, but owners are bad. It can be the most played game ever but G1( R.I.P.) Prepare yourself on server lags and fps drops. :)
1039	1	a	the game is cool
1041	1	a	Good TPS!  You can drive, shoot. Pure PvP! (I'm an idiot! xD ) It has a lot of guns, even a social map (it's rare to see that in a shooter game).  The best: Customization. You can even draw things on your clothes! *-* &lt;3  The worst: Cash guns with time limit. I hate when devs put those things! -.-'
1043	1	a	Many people consider APB: Reloaded as a P2W game but it really isn't its more skill based you can kill maxed ranked players that own ARMAS Marketplace weapons with the starting gun. The default gun given is the most balanced gun in the game good for long range and close ranged. The Apparent P2W guns are obtainable for rent without paying but require Joker Tickets which you can obtain from fight club. Honestly I feel like this game is not P2W more like you need Skill2Win I would recommend APB to any other gamer out there.   People also forget the positive parts about APB: Reloaded which includes the games detailed character design. The customization in APB is by far one of the best due to the ability to make individual symbols and then place those symbols anywhere on a piece of owned clothing, car or graffiti. Regarding the Symbol editor you have amazing artwork for purchase from other players with in game money that could be tattoos, clothing details, car logos, anime characters, nsfw, guns, and other things.   Positives: - Great customization - Fun - Mailbox at Social District - That nice tingling sensation when you beat a maxed rank gold - Combat is more strategic then a point and click to kill shooter - GM's hold events occasionally and distribute GM Joker Boxes - Fight club for those who like instant action - Variety of guns in which each gun counters another just got to be smart on what you choose  Negatives: - About 1/3 of the cool clothing is armas - The fastest car in game with nitro is as fast as a potatoe (Feels like the max speed is 100kmph) - Occasional server lag - In game 13 yr olds that teabag - occasional hacker   Overall I rate APB: Reloaded 8/10
1045	1	a	10/10 To much time wasted on here to invest in something productive, like taking a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1047	1	a	Play from Australia and it is unbelievably delay for driving a car. It is like max out the driving difficulty. :P But what make this game so good is a extreme customisations that I never ever see before.
1049	1	a	Gets on, gets hit by a car driven by a little kid, flys across the sky, dies, gets tbaged, spends $5 on ammo..  - 11/10 Would waste more time and real $ to play again.
1051	1	a	My only qualm with this is the fact that the creators are genius. Their main draw is also their main source of income. Customization. Want to customize your car? Go for it. But you can't have more than X number of decal levels until you have a GOLD ACCOUNT. Want to customize your character? Of course you do, so go absolutely nuts. Right up until you decide to decorate their clothes specifically. GOLD ACCOUNT. How about your spray-tags? Weapons? Anything else? Same restrictions. It's evil genius.
1053	1	a	so i downloaded this game for the first time ever and it just crashes on start up
1055	1	a	ItsÂ´acceptable
1057	1	a	decent.  needs new engine, please g1 I want that bloom back!  community is small but it's alright apart from the cheaters.
1059	1	a	vey good for a free game its amazing
1061	1	a	I would have to say, the customization in this game is WAY better than GTA 5. By a long shot  I think this game deserves a thumb up because:  - It adds a compeitive feeling.  - The customization is unlimited. You can pretty much customize everything.  - The graphics are great and beat some games that are newer than APB  Cons -   - Since the game has been out for so long, people have more OP weapons. Or they buy them from ARMAS Market  - We've been playing the same missions for five years. Please add more,  - Some character issues like your eyes not moving, No jiggle bones on b()()bs.  - Some other small bugs.
1063	1	a	this game is really good, Very fun to play with friends. 'It's awesome'
1065	1	a	vey good for a free game its amazing
1067	1	a	such a good game can customize a lot of stuff, the graphics are pretty good, i like the gameplay of it,
1069	1	a	If you can get past the lag spikes, and the occasional hacker. This has to be one of the best open world MMO/PvP games I've ever played. The customization in this game is brilliant. It is still a very much work in progress as far as games go, but it gets better and better.
1071	1	a	Basically what is GTA V for free but backwards in the fact that it's a MMO so there really isn't much of a story. Gameplay is fun and I had a fun time even thought these types of games aren't really my thing. Although I enjoyed customizing my character, and just roaming around the streets in my car listening to music.   I may just play for a while longer and it will keep me busy for awhile. As someone whod doesn't really like guns it's not really my thing. But if you like GTA type games then you will like this one.    This review is rather short and lacking compared to my typical review but it's just more of a short my thoughts.
1073	1	a	This game is cancer, but i still love it! Dont play it if you dont have milions of dollars to spend.
1075	1	a	help... i... cant.. stop....
1077	1	a	Play from Australia and it is unbelievably delay for driving a car. It is like max out the driving difficulty. :P But what make this game so good is a extreme customisations that I never ever see before.
1079	1	a	Start in a crappy car and then get screwed up by grenades in missions, start doing stunts around the city, land the car on your squad member R.I.P Chicken Nuggetz :(
1081	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ servers, hacker, pay to win.. but a lot of fun!  
1083	1	a	help... i... cant.. stop....
1085	1	a	This game is pretty nice, most items in Armas ( ingame market) its just clothes. But since clothes not give you any stats, its nothing. Weapons are mostly reskins. Company working slowly, so updates here kind of rare. But still this game worth to try.    Only 1 advice, don't play alone! Soloing in this game is unreal. Try to stay in your newbie districts (Green/Bronze) as long as you can ;)   Don't forget to read steam/forums guides.  gh hf
1087	1	a	APB: Reloaded is not your typical Open-World Sandbox TPS, with over a thousand+ way's to customize your character, vehicle, guns &amp; more APB: Reloaded really set's the standard for F2P Open-World Sandbox games. If you haven't played it yet, I highly reccomend that you do. This game will bring you hours upon hours of enjoyment. I'll admit that when your first starting out it may be a little bit confusing but if you need any help just simply check out the Guide's section on the Steam Store or go search some stuff on YouTube.
1089	1	a	I played it for around 800 hours and I love and hate it at the same time.    10/10 - I want to rage quit again. &lt;3
1091	1	a	Best customization ever :)
1093	1	a	ItsÂ´acceptable
1095	1	a	decent.  needs new engine, please g1 I want that bloom back!  community is small but it's alright apart from the cheaters.
1097	1	a	This is one of my favorite games i know its pay 2 win but you can still have fun with friends making clothes, and symbols and you can do really many things like you can do in grand theft auto 5 but you got too have a pretty good pc
1099	1	a	Seems to demand way more from your computer than it should (though I admittedly know little about MMO game design) and it LOVES to stutter at the worst possible times for me.   It also feels very 'pay to win' at times, though that's usually only a major factor if the opposing team is stacked with premium items. One on one, A skilled player with vanilla items usually still trumps an unskilled player with premium items  That said, if your computer can handle it smoothly, it can be a blast to play with a group of coordinated friends. Steam only let's me thumb up or thumb down, so I recommend it with an 'if' attached
1101	1	a	5 years ago, and still love it
1103	1	a	Honestly id say its a great game, ive had alot of good hours in this.  Easy to get into a clan, meet some people and enjoy some hours in missions. But then again boring alone, full of trolls like everyother game, not just to get started on the toxic players in this game. Cheaters included. Some says its p2w but id say it pay to look good. Most of the guns in armas are reskins, every gun can be beaten so i wouldnt listen to that.  Then again it gets boring in the long run, mostly the same things over and over, so be creative and have some fun with friends and its an enjoyable game.
1105	1	a	This game's pretty neat
1107	1	a	This game is awesome
1109	1	a	Awsome cop and robber game! but the best part... make your own tattoes, put them on your body, buy a car, costumize it with your personal style! make your clothes the way you want it! make yourself, make a famous actor/ person you really like! there are really no limit!   PS: you might encounter hackers, atleast I did :( but its still worth it, just for the character costumazations!
1111	1	a	for free you can't really go wrong....I joined, created my character. went in...tanked some team and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them over and over with their decked out upgraded gear with my fresh off the bat noobie rifle.....i killed some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ named rhianna. it felt great...driving around mugging pedestrians, running people over and jacking cars...it's got all your basic gta needs.. enjoying people's masturbational conversation  in the social district while trying to edit my character has also thus far been a privilege in terms of losing faith in my ability to not want to find people in their homes and murder them in the most sadistic way possible....i'm talking peeling off toenails and frying the skin underneath with a blowtorch level of sadistic.
1113	1	a	In this review I will go over the basic gameplay and explain the Pro and Cons to this game. For a shorter review scroll to the bottom and read the summery.  APB is a MMO third person shooter based on the idea of Cops vs Criminals. Players queue for matches in district servers to do mini pvp matches against each other which take place in various parts of the map. There are 2 'PVE' maps and 2'PVP maps currently. The two PVE maps are the Finacial and Waterfront, each hold their own factions alliances in the district. Players either pledge to a specific contact to level up their standing with them or just play at random leveling up whoever is available.   Both Criminals and Enforcers (Cops) get their own specific gameplay that they can do while in the game. Criminals can operate burgleries by ramming into stores and storage units to steal the items inside,or robbing civilians on the street, then fence the items at their closest contact. Once the items are turned in the criminals are then required to go to the 'Money Launder' to collect the cash. Enforcers can participate in this as well, it is called 'Wittness Mode'. While a Enforcer is driving about he can patrol for Criminals commiting crimes and when he finds them he presses the Wittness Key, default Alt, and him and the criminal are now put into a mission where the Enforcer needs to get the evidence to the lock up while the Criminal needs to get it to the fence. This is a very unique system that is very entertaining and always present in the game. Enforcers also get a unique gameplay choice which is Less Than Lethal weapons. LTL weapons are the games way of making it more interesting and putting a twist on the game. When using LTL weapons, the Enforcer stuns the enemy and then arrests the Criminal. Criminals are able to free their team mates from handcuffs but only if they can make it there in time. The advantage to LTL is it makes the spawn timer longer, with the disadvantage that the LTL have a shorter range and require time to arrest Criminals putting the Enforcer in danger of enemy fire.  Being that the game is a third person shooter, the game is less about skill and more about placement. Covering corners and knowing the range of your weapons as well as how they fire can give you a large advantage over players who are simply pointing and shooting. The starting rifle both Crims and Enforcers start with is incredibly good, both in accuracy and power but it must be fired with control burst instead of full auto otherwise it loses it's strengths. That being said the game is incredibly unfriendly to new players, it has such a large learning curve that it causes most people to give up and stop playing. Because of that the playerbase is reletively smaller and all the players tend to merge into the 'Silver' districts which can cause unfair match making. New players should be recomended to play on the 'Bronze' servers until they learn the ropes better and are ready for the big servers.  One of the biggest gripes about the game is the cash shop, yes the cash shop sells weapons. Before you drop the game though you should know the weapons in the cash shop have very little difference compared to the 'free' weapons. Most CS weapons are infact reskins of the free ones, with the exception of the few that are special/unique weapons. One of the most powerful weapons in the game is also one of the first ones you unlock for free. Most of what comes out of the cash shop is cosmetic items that are for cars and clothes.  So now that we went over the basics and you have a little bit of an understanding of what you are getting into, lets get into the good things about this game. Number one of all time is, the customization. Free players are limited on how much customization they can do in the game, but even then I've seen amazing things come from free people. You can style everything from the clothes you wear to the logos on them, from the tattoos on your body to how fat you want to be. Customize your car, it's color, the model, the decals, the lisence plate, body kits, even interior design on some of them. Your weapons can be modifide depending if you unlocked guns with open mod slots. Do you like your gun shooting faster, more accurate, longer range, better zoom, better hipfire, bigger magazine, or maybe you like to carry more ammo. You can use mods to change that. Even with your car too, Nitro, Steel plating, mobile spawn, mobile ammo supply, or even have a brick that can be used when you jump out of your car to launch it at enemy players. Players can add mods to their character as well to carry ammo, be able to survive hits from vehicles, reduce fall damage, or even ride ontop of cars without falling off. The game has endless combinations and possiblities that you can take advantage of and have fun with.  The conclusion, if you can get around the very steep learning curve, get over the cash shop selling weapons and just have fun with the game, you will enjoy it. This game is one of the few games where customization is literally at your command. Dress as a business man, or run around half naked, it's your choice. Alter your weapons to your play style and make your dream car, it's all in your hands. The game is definately worth a try for people who like shooters, but remember that the game can put you in unfair match making at times. This is because of the size of the playerbase, the more people play the better match making gets. Those of you who just read the bottom and are thinking of trying the game, I suggest you give the whole review a once over to understand what I'm talking about completely and half some understanding of what you are going to be doing ingame.
1115	1	a	Love the customization of the game
1117	1	a	â€œAll Points Bulletin is a social experiment that makes money by breeding a race of people who will try anything to get what they want. It's like a new isotope of sociopath.â€
1119	1	a	Oh APB....better known as ALWAYS PLAYERS BlTCHING.  Tutorial: Covers almost nothing besides basic movment. Grahpics: For a game released in 2010, it looks decent, however it is very poorly optimized and basic system requirements will net you about 5 fps. Gameplay: Honestly? It at times can be great, and other times it makes you rage so hard your skin turns green. Between the hackers (which some people will refuse exsist in this game) the tryhards, and the game just downright screwing you over, you will get mad at this game. Playerbase: Filled with trolls and children.  This game is basiclly a GTA MMO. And being F2P they have done a great job keeping it from being P2W. Now on the downside, there are hackers like any other game. Only problem is, those are the same hackers who have played for YEARS. The next issue is the massive egos players have and the complete cesspool community. Played EVE? Imagine that and multiply it by 100. Yeap, that bad. If you can get passed the ignorant children and the known hackers, this game is hands down the best game I have played. I have around 4500 hours, don't let steam fool you. It wasn't always on steam. It's worth a download.   APB features much more than just mission based PvP. You can deisgn your own clothing, cars, symbols, music, themes, etc. They also offer fightclubs which is a fast way to get in the action if you only have a small ammount of time to play such a game.   Be warned however, the cash shop is VERY over priced. So much over priced a single gun runs you about the price of a new video game. Do not buy anything unless it goes on sale, which happens fairly often.
1121	1	a	Note: This game is NOT pay to win, people with no time and skill spent into this game are full of ****. So put that aside â™¥  List of goods and bads of this game below  Good: -Good quality team fights -Great customisation (Clothes, themes, vechicles, graffiti sprays) -Open world fights (Can literally flank from anywhere) -Weapons paid for ingame cash(Weeks time for a weapons for ingame cash) -Easy market system -Preferred maps (There is 2 type maps, one focuses on close range and one on long)  Bad: -Engine promises for years (Graphic update that never happend) -Toxic players -Couple of glitches (Car glitches into map) -Bad optimisation (Game is not very well optimised and will freeze every couple of minutes)   These are my opinions from playing 1256 hours  Hope to see the game get fixed up and play more with a future engine update.
1123	1	a	This game good but there so maney cheaters that destroy the fun of the game !!!!
1125	1	a	Fun game at times. Friendly community. Bad thing about this game is smurfing and its pretty much P2W. Doesnt help new players too much Alternative to GTA
1127	1	a	Not Bad
1129	1	a	Rage PB anyone?
1131	1	a	A lot of fun awaits you in APB if you have a team of friends to play it with. Customization options are incredible. Nothing feels better than putting a naughty tattoo on your body and shock the serious players with it. On the other hand, it is pay2win, stereotypic and matchmaking is sometimes unfair. But I appreciate that anybody can try it for free. 7,5/10  What's there to hate about this review?? :D I wonder.. Tell me in the comment section in stead of monkey clicking the thumb down. I want to know, because I want to improve.
1133	1	a	I think this game is good time stealer but p2w i would recommend this game :)
1135	1	a	It's ok
1137	1	a	Sure APB Reloaded has it's up's &amp; down's but personly I recomend this 3rd person shooter for anyone who like's PVP game's. You might feel like you suck but after you play it for a few hour's you will get used to it so before you give up, give it a try and see what you think.
1139	1	a	The game is absolutely incredible. I've read a lot of negative reviews, but I believe most of them aren't justified. People call the game 'unfair' to new players. But seriously, the game is no different than any MMORPG out there, you can't start a character on level 1 and expect to kill level 100 players. The difference is a lot smaller though, I've made 17 kills in a mission versus top-level opponents as soon as I started playing the game, with only starter weapons. Other complains are that it's 'pay to win', which is also untrue. Basically premium only helps you speed up the process and get money faster to buy weapons, also unlocks more customization options. However the premium doesn't even affect the gameplay, it's mostly like an EXP boost which are being sold in most MMO's. Other complains are that the game is dying. Actually the community is slowly starting to grow back. It gained 16% more players just this month, so the game isn't really dying at all. Some districts are so crowded that it gets even annoying. Another complain is that the community sucks and people are teamkilling eachother. Basically it's no different than CS:GO. When you kill more than 5 teammates you get kicked from the game, so I don't see a problem here.  The only thing that I agree with the negative reviews are that the game lags. A lot. I cover up the recommended requirements all the way, yet the game still lags on low graphic time to time. I still don't know what's the problem, but even with lag I can't help it, but enjoy the game. It's just awesome. Tons of customizations, tons of fun, cars, weapons .. everything. I hope the devs do something about the lag issue, then I will count it as the best f2p game ever.
1141	1	a	Had the best moments with my friends. Rage moments , Funny moments , i recommend this game because is just awesome. But the community is not so good. Have fun with it !
1143	1	a	Really fun for a free game.
1145	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APBâ€™s new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010â€™s deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results. The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first gameâ€™s devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one. Reloadedâ€™s missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars. Most of APBâ€™s problems remain in Reloaded. It even inherited a few new ones, as it is currently seeded with cheaters. The original game was arguably killed too soon, so the switch to free-to-play means interested parties should at least take a weekend city break back to San Paro. But this is no revitalisation â€“ APB Reloaded is rehash, replication, and repetition.
1147	1	a	she wants the D.
1149	1	a	If you tired of GTA 4 PoliceMod Here You Are . You choose to leave a life of crime or protect the dumbass city , its fun but matchmaking sucks . When your lvl 1 you go against a lvl 30 or something its so stupid , but fun . I realy wish there was a 50\50 button so I could recommend it so I give this a 50\50 , 5\10 4\8 2\4 1\2 ALLTHE HALVES
1151	1	a	APB Reloaded is an awesome game that gives you the chance to play GTA free :D
1153	1	a	Could be so much more. I still play it anyway.
1155	1	a	Fun game to play lone wolf or with a few friends. Long wolf you'll be play with others regardless. With friends communications will help you a lot, which is a given. Unlimited ways to customise your character, clothes, cars, symbols and themes. 9/10 imo
1157	1	a	3000 hours spent over 2 years, 2 characters max rank and many reroll attempts. I won't bother you with my terrible English so let's do it pros and cons:  Pros (because there are pros... honestly) + atmospheric (urban settings even though it does feel like an old game). + Fast-paced - what I like and hate the most about this game (I'll explain you why). + Best customization system of all time. Believe me! I've spent hundred of hours in the editor. + Absolutly NOT P2W  Cons (ok! I'll go easy on G1): - Infested with cheaters. - Nothing interesting after 1K hours. - Boring clan system. - Toxic (adult yet immature) community. - Unbalanced weapons (Ntec, low yields, NHVR you name it!) But hey! Part-of-the-game excuse! Remember? - Poor customer support - my tip: don't buy anything or no less than 50â‚¬ to Gamersfirst. If you get scammed, banned for no reason there's a high chance that the GM who is in charge of the customer support (not even kidding) will kindly ask you to p*** off. - Poor community management: 1 GM for 4 servers (2000 players) ... why not? And don't tell me there's more than one, I wouldn't believe you.   Now pro&amp;con: +New engine's coming soon (Announced back in 2013), Overkill servers on Obeya - No developement in the meantime: APB has been released then shut down then bought then realesed again etc etc. Since 2011 there has been nothing we could consider like game developement. New guns and reskins aren't relevant, we want new cars, new game mechanics, weapon balance, realistic gameplay (shooting and car physics) and no NHVR jumpshooters Yoloyield spammers please!  That's it folks! If I should recommend it? Yes but make sure you have at least a good friend to play with you ... and something else to help keep calm.
1159	1	a	11/10 would play but wouldn't cuz edgy to hate it all.
1161	1	a	love the customization in this game, its great
1163	1	a	The embodiment of the phrase 'Pay to Win' whomever has mommy's credit card wins the misson hands down. The missons are exactly the same idea everytime, break into this , kill that, find this etc.   With all its flaws its still good for about an hour of fun before you get frustrated or realize that its truly not worth your time.  4/10
1165	1	a	it says it requires very little but my pc has better then that and still has pretty bad frames but in gernerality It is very adicting and fun
1167	1	a	This game is so bad!
1169	1	a	I don't know why, but i really recommend this game. Good soundtrack, pretty nice graphics, cool gameplay. Just play it! No matter if these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that pay by 'Microtransactions' are rekting ya. Just have fun! &lt;3
1171	1	a	For a free to play game this is fantastic, while i have some complaints overall its really good, much potential
1173	1	a	Combat is kinda wonky, but the rest of the game is good.
1175	1	a	For no reason 
1177	1	a	Its probably the best game i've ever played , but mainteance of the G1 is a serious issue and ruins it for everyone  However game is still playable and has about 1000-1500 players daily on Citadel (EU server)  I vote yes for game and no for G1
1179	1	a	Great and fun Open World game
1181	1	a	APB has tons of ways to customize and you can choose between being an enforcer or a criminal.
1183	1	a	An Awesome Game!! XD This game is just like GTA 5 basically, but just less features thats all. No lag in all servers that i have played. Really fun game when u play with friends
1185	1	a	this game is pay 2 win if you want to level up only with G1 Credits  i dont say we have pepole that dont buy G1 Credits and they succses in this game but mostly you need to buy G1 Credits because the weapons there is OP = over power..  so have fun and dont spent a lot of money :D  
1187	1	a	Note: Don't spend money on this game. Don't interact with the community. Don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off the devs or the GMs. Just... Dont.  How to enjoy APB: 1) Make your character look awesome 2) Find some friends 3) Start using call outs and stuff so you are working together as a team 4) Play for fun do not play to win 5) Ignore the trolls  Follow these and you will love this game. Some of the best character customization in any game ever and it's open world take on mission based PvP is fun and makes the game feel different every time you play!
1189	1	a	its fun if you pay like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of money! 
1191	1	a	Cheeky Scrub m8.
1193	1	a	IMMA SLIME
1195	1	a	I know I put recommended, but it's only really because the game is free. It is extremely pay to play/win, but there is decent gear you can get for free. I did on the whole enjoy my time playing, but when the enemies had OP â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was EXTREMELY annoying. If you dont mind it taking quite a while to get good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and/or spending a few bucks, its great, otherwise, play a different game.
1197	1	a	Haven't played too much on this account but this game might not be the best anymore, but it is like a Cops'N'Robbers take on Saints Row, and both are loved by many and in conclusion, the game now isn't bad, still a little fun hourwaster. Kinda reminds me of CrimeCraft before they took it and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed it up with GangWars. Not a bad game. If you want a GTA-ish game, try it out!
1199	1	a	The best game ever :*
1201	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this games good
1203	1	a	One of the best games ever.
1205	1	a	There is better ways to hurt yourself than playing this game.
1207	1	a	1.Install 2.Make account 3.Start playing 4.Choose to be a cop 5.Get killed by a P2P criminal 6.Uninstall  10/10 Would arrest again
1209	1	a	In order to be really good, you need to spend lots of money
1211	1	a	Pros+++ +Character creation. +Customization. clothes,vechile,songs,etc. +Decent graphics. +Vehicles. +Lot of challenge. (Its not enough u know how to aim, u cant just run centre of street!) +Can find kind player too, true nerds, u can even buy zelda songs!  Cons--- -Matchmaking!! (U have to join bronze district if u silver or lower threat!) -Toxic/cheating community like most of competive games. -Devs dont to right thinks to improve game. -Some of guns are bit p2w. -Sometimes game lag when it get ddosed. -Car spawnz are op! -Fog of war. -No headshots. -Mission reward low without premium.  Still better game than cs go.
1213	1	a	Must playe de apebe
1215	1	a	Great Game, Great Graphics.
1217	1	a	its looks like GTA online free to play style
1219	1	a	Steve is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1221	1	a	Okay, I like this game so I'm gonna list the pros and cons:  Pros. Good graphics Smooth car handling Easy to start You can be in groups  Cons. Servers shut down frequently BlingLords with over 9000 rank try to blow/gun you down any chance they get (these people can only do this if they're in a different faction) A tiny bit confusing
1223	1	a	10/10 game never gets boring i recomend u guys play it
1225	1	a	So Cool Game But You Know Cheaters ...  Cheaters Everywhere
1227	1	a	Here are my thoughts about this game. With the the new engine update coming out the game will now have things open to it that it did not before, with a better engine not only means better graphics but the potentital to expand into something new and refreshing.  The game is good and it's been good to me for a sold 2-3 years now, now I've had my fair share of breaks, trust me. However, there is no other game that can compete with this in terms of customization. That is the sole reason I come back to this game everytime. The customization is so in depth that it makes MMORPG's with their super detailed character creation look like child's play. (Opinion)   Yes there are flaws in the games mechanics that could use some work, but if you look past that and focus on the game itself, it's a great game with lots of potential to grow yet.
1229	1	a	this game is awesome! you can be cops or crims you can get money from missons and buy cars and clothes and guns! and you can do missons with friends and buy thing for your car and get a name and edit your people!

1241	1	a	Love this game very much! No words can explain &lt;3
1243	1	a	 I'm playing APB for years now, since the Open Beta. Don't be confused by my steam profile, I've played APB with the G1 client before, that's why Steam doesn't show my full amount of played hours.
1245	1	a	best gta clone ever.

1253	1	a	Been playing this game for over 2 years. Yes like every game this game has flaws, and YES we complain about it everyday, but its sooooo addicting that it makes us come back the next day. It has both action and social features, the game has one of the best desigining features in the history of games, i would prefer it if ur a artist too and I would really recommend this game for open world game players, plus its really close to GTA multiplayer... Better actually :)
1255	1	a	puts a fun creative spin on cops and robbers with the adition of guns,cars and hole lot of customization toping it of with the fact  its massmultiplayer and free roam U CAN BE CRIMANLES AND KILL TINGS CAUSE U KNOW THATS WHAT CRIMS DO
1257	1	a	Pretty fun even though you have to deal with alot of lag sometimes. but it's free and fun to play in the creation screens for everything from tattoos to your cars and character
1259	1	a	Bought the retail version after a few hours of playtime, REALLY enjoy it, there's no PVE no stupid grinding, just pure GTA style action with some MMO elements, what's not to like ? :D
1261	1	a	Awesome game!!! reminds GTA and it's online
1263	1	a	Great way to past time really with friends this denf a squad game. c;
1265	1	a	1/10 Would not load again.
1267	1	a	I don't know why, but i really recommend this game. Good soundtrack, pretty nice graphics, cool gameplay. Just play it! No matter if these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that pay by 'Microtransactions' are rekting ya. Just have fun! &lt;3
1269	1	a	Ignoring the fact the game is Pay 2 Win, there are you occasional hackers, gold in silver servers, and all that jazz, this is prehaps one of the best games I have ever played. I remember staying up till 5 in the morning playing, either pwning with the starter which is secretly op, or getting rekted by bought guns which should really be nerfed. You should try it out and see if you can put up with the unfair disadvantages I once had to put up with.
1271	1	a	Great customization, be who you wanna be. Great running gun battles, drive bys.. Like GTA but more freedom and custom cars.
1273	1	a	it's ok
1275	1	a	Awsome game with many unique class sets and an AMAZING collection of clothes,vehicles etc.!!!!!!Game isnt easy but after a bit youll get a hang of it but never give up if you die or lose your valuables.HAVE FUN PLAYING APB Reloaded! -smackr757
1277	1	a	This game is as addicting as it is fun! whether you are a cop or a criminal you will never get bored. There are tons of weapons, vehicles, clothing options, and modifications! you can even create your own designs and make clothing or vehicles with it!!!! GET THIS GAME 10/10
1279	1	a	Its sow funny whit frends
1281	1	a	Was good for me, but they have to fix the people you get matched against... I don't like getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1283	1	a	i rate this game john cena out of 10. this game is like bilcosby its cute for one night and then next thing you know you get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and loose all the money you own and your viginity
1285	1	a	Very well done for a free to play game. Great for GTA fans wanting multiplayer
1287	1	a	This Is An Amazing Game!!! Play It!
1289	1	a	Really fun for a free game.
1291	1	a	My first impression of APB Reloaded is possitive. I think, when playing together with friends, it will give you a nice co-op experience where tactical team-work can be a vital advantage.  Though personally, I find it not so straight forward on how everything works. Like choosing different weapons, how the missions and objectives work, etc. But it gets clearer ones playing I suppose.
1293	1	a	gta multiplayer for people who like to be confused and die too much but it is free
1295	1	a	This game is terrible.
1297	1	a	best game u will ever play
1299	1	a	she wants the D.
1301	1	a	Fun but its kinda laggy and unpolished otherwise FUN
1303	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APBâ€™s new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010â€™s deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results. The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first gameâ€™s devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one. Reloadedâ€™s missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars. Most of APBâ€™s problems remain in Reloaded. It even inherited a few new ones, as it is currently seeded with cheaters. The original game was arguably killed too soon, so the switch to free-to-play means interested parties should at least take a weekend city break back to San Paro. But this is no revitalisation â€“ APB Reloaded is rehash, replication, and repetition.
1305	1	a	Large skill gap, a bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ players, but so worth it once you're used to it.
1307	1	a	good and fun game enjoy playing it
1309	1	a	If you tired of GTA 4 PoliceMod Here You Are . You choose to leave a life of crime or protect the dumbass city , its fun but matchmaking sucks . When your lvl 1 you go against a lvl 30 or something its so stupid , but fun . I realy wish there was a 50\50 button so I could recommend it so I give this a 50\50 , 5\10 4\8 2\4 1\2 ALLTHE HALVES
1311	1	a	.
1313	1	a	Better than GTA!!!
1315	1	a	If you want a free GTA Online then this is as close as you're gonna get! It is a really fun game and you may aswell try it because it is free! 9/10
1317	1	a	It's like GTA but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's the poor man's GTA.
1319	1	a	It's like a GTA, but online.Visual very realistic and you can make tatooes,change cars and sounds.
1321	1	a	This game is sooo like gta 5 and the graphics are good and theres all different guns 2 choose :) 
1323	1	a	...!
1325	1	a	From the first 10 minutes of playing, I knew I'd love this game
1327	1	a	Many lag, much anger, so mystery, wow!
1329	1	a	 First of all, I would like to say I have not spent any real money on this game. I haven't bought any DLC or In-Game Purchases.   Me and my friends really enjoy this game. We love doing missions together, and having to take down enemies. We definatley reccomend it, you don't have to pay to have fun.  Here are some reasons to try out the game -    3 Huge Maps   Ride in teamate's cars   Heaps of Character Customization   Vehicle Upgrades   Realistic Models   Crews - Paint your emblem on your car/clothes   Loads of Weapons   Fast pace shooter action   Dozens of cars to unlock and buy   Shooting out of car windows   You can smash into stores and rob them   Emotes   Good Sound FX   Play your own music in cars   You can be police and arrest people   Good amount of national servers   Alot of co-op missions against other teams   You can sometimes play missions by yourslef with no enemies   You don't need a beast computer to run it  
1331	1	a	This is my most played game, it is outstanding for a free to play game. With the size and variety of the virtual the city of San Paro, there is little repetition. It is the free GTA.
1333	1	a	Wow its Gta iv :P

1337	1	a	Nice TPS, still needs some fix but it is nice to play on free time.
1339	1	a	If you tired of GTA 4 PoliceMod Here You Are . You choose to leave a life of crime or protect the dumbass city , its fun but matchmaking sucks . When your lvl 1 you go against a lvl 30 or something its so stupid , but fun . I realy wish there was a 50\50 button so I could recommend it so I give this a 50\50 , 5\10 4\8 2\4 1\2 ALLTHE HALVES
1341	1	a	best game u will ever play
1343	1	a	Game is good if you like a tongue in your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1345	1	a	well i haven't play this game before but i watched it on youtube and go type the channel who make the apb reloaded video is rapid99apb police chase on youtube type it there and you can like talk to people make friends shoot enemies and all that kind of stuff you can drive all the day's work of san paro and you can shoot criminials i must have said it already but oh well thats the support i need bye
1347	1	a	puts a fun creative spin on cops and robbers with the adition of guns,cars and hole lot of customization toping it of with the fact  its massmultiplayer and free roam U CAN BE CRIMANLES AND KILL TINGS CAUSE U KNOW THATS WHAT CRIMS DO
1349	1	a	Good game but u need to be smart to play
1351	1	a	...!
1353	1	a	I recomend this Game because it is just an amazing graphical game with lots of missions and many more things it's like GTA 5 but no flying or boating so it's like a free gta you might as well get it because it is a free game that plays amazingly. The driving controlls are w,a,s,d, but you can make do with them and change the settings if you want so I rate the game. 9.5/10 for being free and this good you should get it and play it and be happy.
1355	1	a	Take it from someone that has way more hours on this game then steam shows (as i played before the Steam release) This is a great game, yes it has its flaws and its dev team can be very untrustworthy for what they say. But all in all this game is awesome. The biggest cry you will see out there is 'P2W' and 'Hackers'. This game is far from P2W, one of the most powerful weapons in the game is the Starter gun known as the STAR-556 with its big brother the N-Tec, both f2p weapons that can beat ANY gun at ANY range with the proper amount of skill. In fact around 90% of the games Premium Weapons are Re-skinned versions of the f2p varient with a different look and sound (N-Tec=CR-5[AK-&gt;M16]) granted there are a few weapons that are unique in the premium (ARMAS) store but they are far from P2W, requireing a situational or unique playstle to use/master, the problem comes down to price with permanant premium guns costing $20-$60 each. The next cry comes from hackusations. Where as i found hackers are really far and few in between depending on your server (EU servers and Asian Servers have time and time again proven to have more hackers 10 fold) and when you do encounter a hacker they can be outplayed just like any other player. Wallhacks wont help you here, aimbots only aim they dont account for recoil or dispersion.  This game is great even at its current state, where most of its negitive reviews come from F2P warriors that cant even afford a summer sale game or a runescape membership and people that just cant cope with its learning curve (which is very steep). But once you learn the game and are able to stick with it, you will LOVE it. with endless customization and tons of laughs to be had ive found myself playing this game over Triple A games.  Give it a shot and dont give up too soon.  10/10 would spank walletless 12 year olds again.
1357	1	a	mmm thats preety good 
1359	1	a	lol cool game but storyless
1361	1	a	I've yet to spend a single cent of real monney in this game but I still have fun.
1363	1	a	nice pay to win games . fix the lag please
1365	1	a	Gonna love how all the idiots say this is P2W. It is HARD to understand that the paid weapons are just RESKINS of the normal weapons? It even says so in their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing description and on the wiki. Everyone just comes and reviews after 20hrs not getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about this game. Funny.  This game is GOOD. It is fun, and brings tons of activites you can do solo or with friends. In terms of PvP, you need strong nerves to play it. If you get slightly frustrated by stupidities outside this game, you will not enjoy APB.   Thanks for downvoting my review, but after hitting that thumb down button go check the wiki for the so-called 'paid-weapons' you are so much crying about.
1367	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played in my life
1369	1	a	it's cool game and i like it because it's many things to do
1371	1	a	idk for but i like gta5 is better my opinon i will say yes its a good game and i like both gta 5 and apb there good games.
1373	1	a	Its probably the best game i've ever played , but mainteance of the G1 is a serious issue and ruins it for everyone  However game is still playable and has about 1000-1500 players daily on Citadel (EU server)  I vote yes for game and no for G1
1375	1	a	fun recomend good graphics card though
1377	1	a	This is one of the best f2p games out there, you should give this a try
1379	1	a	best played with friends :D
1381	1	a	I was minding my own business walking across the street. I looked both ways before doing so. As I was half way through crossing the street I was struck and killed by a cop. I mean sure I killed 10 people but I didn't deserve to be killed.
1383	1	a	I really, really want to love APB (All Points Bulletin): Reloaded more than I do. Yes, the original APB was riddled with enough cracks and flaws to take it from diamond-in-the-rough to half-eaten-Ring-Pop-that's-shaped-like-a-diamond, but some of its more ambitious ideas were very nearly brilliant. And hey, Reloaded â€“ for the most part â€“ smartly tweaks APB's little problems while leaving its cops-and-robbers core undisturbed. On paper, it sounds like every wannabe grand automobile thief's dream come true. So then, what exactly went wrong?   Above: If only he'd just worn his safety belt  The short answer: A lot of things. First, though, it's essential to point out what went right, because â€“ without a doubt â€“ APB: Reloaded is a more enjoyable experience than its short-lived predecessor. APB's DNA â€“ once a criss-crossing-crashing amalgam of MMO persistence and barely functional riffs on GTA's best ideas â€“ has been straightened into a much finer point. Weapons now do more damage, resulting in faster, more satisfying firefights. Cars, meanwhile, actually possess unique driving models. In other words, no more sports cars that drive like minivans. There's also a teensy bit of weapon-usage-based stat progression to give you something to do beyond amassing a gun collection that'd make even John Woo's bullet-loving doves flee in terror. And then there's a real-money-based in-game store that... well, more on that in a bit.  In a lot of ways, APB fights desperately to be the antidote to modern MMO drudgery â€“ sometimes to a fault. Beyond rudimentary side objectives (things like raiding stores if you're a criminal or returning stolen cars for enforcers), the game is essentially PVE-free. Missions auto-plop you into a group of fellow ne'er-do-wells (or loose cannon cops who don't play by the rules) and assign you objectives â€“ for instance, investigate a vehicle or commit some nice, wholesome arson. The twist, however, is that your enemies aren't trash mob NPCs - they're flesh-and-blood members of the opposing faction. So missions unfold more like objective-based shooter matches, but in a completely open, vehicle-packed urban playground. When APBR works, it really, really works. There's nothing quite like racing neck-and-neck against a sports car full of gangbangers â€“ guns-a-blazing the whole time â€“ toward an objective, crashing and twisting through the air like you've been punted by Godzilla, and then emerging from the wreckage into a hail of gunfire and, er, regular fire. Other MMOs, meanwhile, ask you to collect 20 boar gizzards because, f*** you, don't question it, chore peasant. Better still, similar chaos unfolds all around you, thanks to other groups on similar â€“ though separate â€“ missions. Bullets fly. Cars careen through the streets. Magic happens.   Before long, though, you can't help but see behind the curtain of explosions and car shrapnel, because that's pretty much all there is to it. Mission types are incredibly limited, generally breaking down into â€œfind and deliver a thing,â€ â€œstop the other team from finding and delivering a thing,â€ and â€œhold a point for a really long time.â€ New self-contained â€œFight Clubâ€ districts attempt to spice up the rather vanilla proceedings with large-scale team deathmatch and king of the hill battles, but the two currently available maps lend themselves more to haphazard lone wolfery and camping than interesting team tactics.   APBR's city, meanwhile, is utterly lacking in the loving attention to detail of, say, a GTA or the zany outlandishness of a Saints Row. It's just a sprawling sea of gray spotted with shamefully tiny islands of intrigue. So, by and large, APBR devolves into a very simple shooter with very simple modes in a very simple environment. On top of that, the story's basically non-existent. Occasionally, your contracted mission-givers will send you emails, but there's no sense of escalation or progression. It's just an unending tug-of-war between cops and robbers that never actually goes anywhere â€“ a dynamic justifiable only if APBR is secretly set in Purgatory. That general lack of personality becomes all the more disappointing when you start really digging into APBR's absurdly robust character customization suite. Once you've filled out your wardrobe and unlocked a few decal templates, anything's possible. So, of course, we created something that could best be described as the unholy offspring of Batman Beyond and the mopiest, most blue-haired JRPG character you can imagine. At one point, we actually encountered an incredibly authentic Harley Quinn â€“ jester cap and all â€“ and it was love at first sight. Then she shot us in the face. Long story short, APBR's players supply nearly all of its personality. And while that's an interesting idea on paper, it fails to thaw a frozen, unchanging world whose bag of tricks is about as deep as a drought-devoured puddle.   But what about all that free-to-play razzle-dazzle that APB savior GamersFirst can't stop clamoring about? Business models, after all, can make or break MMOs. And while APBR's â€œArmas Marketplaceâ€ certainly isn't broken, there are some very worrisome cracks in its armor. For one, the game constantly pestered us about biting a $10 bullet and signing up for a month of Premium access, and it's not hard to see why. Among other things, our piggy bank's valiant sacrifice more than doubled our end-of-mission cash rewards, hugely boosted our faction gains with mission givers, reduced cooldowns, and gave us a 20% discount on all marketplace items. Basically, Premium's the way APBR was meant to be played. Free, by comparison, feels downright sluggish. Then there's the extremely sticky issue of buyable weaponry. Armaments that cost you an arm and a leg aren't necessarily better or worse than those earned by the sweat of your tattooed brow; they're merely different variations on similar ideas. So, ultimately, a kitted out character and someone who upped their arsenal the old fashioned way will be on a roughly even playing field after many hours of play. However, we were able to roll a completely fresh character and immediately buy a fully modded gun that many experienced players swore by. Suddenly, getting matched against fellow low rank players didn't seem so fair. APBR's early goings, then, can be a figurative trial by fire and bees. Because the fire wasn't bad enough.   APBR is a game that suffers from a serious identity crisis. It tries to be both an emergent, skill-based shooter and a full-blown free-to-play MMO, but only succeeds at falling into the abyssal middle ground between the two. Thanks to a number of tiny tweaks and larger additions, Reloaded is definitely a step up from the practically DOA APB that crashed and burned a couple years ago, but the two are still incredibly similar. Fundamental mission structure and variety flaws, unfortunately, stuck around for the ride, and its (improved) simplistic shooting and driving aren't enough to right those wrongs.   It's honestly heartbreaking, because many of the game's ideas teeter on the cusp of being revolutionary. As is, however, All Points Bulletin: Reloaded fires far too many blanks. Free is a tough price to turn down, but the city of San Paro is â€“ at best â€“ a vacation spot. We simply can't recommend an extended stay.
1385	1	a	Its quite interesting i must say!
1387	1	a	[8/10] Nice action shootem up online game
1389	1	a	This is a great game if you can with stand the trashy community. Overall, there's quite a bit of things that need fixing, and are currently in the process of being fixed.   It has countless amounts of replay-ability and can easily be considered one of the most addicting games i've played.   Customizability is great, however they continue to offer a premium service (Which is kinda needed.)   The market place system makes it seem as though the game is pay to win, but overall it's not. You need to put a lot of time into this game to have an enjoyable experience. And by enjoyable i do not mean crashing cars into other cars until they explode.  If i were to give this game a rating out of ten, at least an 8/10.  It's worth the try and if you can't seem to get into it, well, find something else thats up your alley.
1391	1	a	Really enjoyed my time with this game. It was a ton of fun to play with buddies. However, it is greatly hindered by its F2P model, which closely resembles a pay to win format. The hackers obviously do not help either...  Give it a try nonetheless. The hacking has probably been fixed by now. Probably...
1393	1	a	Just a good game ;)
1395	1	a	Yeah, That's A Rich Gang Game
1397	1	a	Good game. Fun. May be innapropriate for younger players ;)
1399	1	a	this game is pay 2 win if you want to level up only with G1 Credits  i dont say we have pepole that dont buy G1 Credits and they succses in this game but mostly you need to buy G1 Credits because the weapons there is OP = over power..  so have fun and dont spent a lot of money :D  
1401	1	a	it says it requires very little but my pc has better then that and still has pretty bad frames but in gernerality It is very adicting and fun
1403	1	a	Better than GTA!!!
1405	1	a	If you want a free GTA Online then this is as close as you're gonna get! It is a really fun game and you may aswell try it because it is free! 9/10
1407	1	a	I started it up and tried to play it. Then I spilt coffee on my keyboard and it became unplayable. 2/29%
1409	1	a	APB: Reloaded used to be really pay-to-win, but somehow they fixed it. You can customize your car, clothes and character. Vehicles and weapons have mods to them. Its a subscription kind of deal, you hire guns with in game money for 14 days. The guns with mods on them already aren't that expansive. It is expansive though to customize your own package.  You can short cut the system by buying the guns/vehicles with mods with actual money. Buying premium will double the exp and in game money you get.  Overall friendly community. You can easily play without friends with the auto group system. Full servers, more criminals then enforcers though. I recommend choosing the enforcer.
1411	1	a	its sick
1413	1	a	cool game ;)
1415	1	a	Welcome to the world of bumpercar, exploding vehicles, fashion shows, missions and random weirdness. Place yourself in a law-destroyed town as a police or criminal, witness or steal, arrest or escape. It's a jolly mayhem that is, ofcourse filled with smurfs so be careful. weapons are all time-limited so when purchasing remember to commit. cars are forever though. You can make personal tattoos, personal graffitti, personal car decorations and thus this game can consume your spare time to the fullest. much fun, do try it.
1417	1	a	UPDATED REVIEW AGAIN: Once Again
1419	1	a	Good concepts, bad executed  GG   10/10  no playorino too shiterino
1421	1	a	ITS SO COOL and realistic and its FUN so DOWNLOAD IT AND PLAY !!!
1423	1	a	Not a bad game
1425	1	a	community sucks lol, not worse than LoL [League Of Legends]
1427	1	a	Its sow funny whit frends
1429	1	a	Was good for me, but they have to fix the people you get matched against... I don't like getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1431	1	a	i rate this game john cena out of 10. this game is like bilcosby its cute for one night and then next thing you know you get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and loose all the money you own and your viginity
1433	1	a	if you dont have the money for gta than git this it is so goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
1435	1	a	#GTA online #pay-to-win #just4nasaPCs
1437	1	a	it doesnt start ? i had the same problem , so what could i do ? i went online and dowloaded it from gmaerfirst online its run a little lagy at time thats cuase my computers shityy and my bro plays t aswell. custimisation is AMAZING i spent 5 hours on this and a long long long LONG time playing having fun , issions, and money , obioslly it cost a little bit for good things but i havent spent â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and im still enjoying it .
1439	1	a	+  Open world sandbox (Medium areas); Drivable vehicles; Custom clothes and cars Various weapons to use;   -  Poor optimization; A few modes to play, it feels repetitive. (Youget bored quickly.); The world doesn't feel alive, the people are souless; Only 2 main maps to play and 1 to custumize your character.  Score: 6/10.
1441	1	a	Made a Rainbow Dash themed cruiser and character, won match, made guy go on a 10 minute rant in server chat about mlp  would â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off edgy people again 10/10
1443	1	a	After 10+ hours of Internet disconnecting, I got it. Bad graphics card. 10/10 hours.
1445	1	a	no one cares just play the game.
1447	1	a	Whats to say about this game. Be ready to die alot. I mean ALOT. you get destroyed by people who buy guns on a free to play game who can kill yopu incredibly fast. But the customization and driving are amazing. You can customize everything, and it feels amazing to have your own logo on clothes and your car. Gunfights require alot of skill, so if you arent that good at video games, be ready yet again to die. But the parkour is so good, you can jump along rooftops, but you cant climb up buildings as in Assassins Creed. Map design is kinda bad, two maps with very bland environments, needs another map. And you need to grind and farm XP forever to get the clothes you want, and it takes forever unless youre premium. Good thing there are plenty of codes for free premium lasting from one day to maybe five days.
1449	1	a	A british person told me to get this game. I deleted it shortly and cut off all communication with the british person and his associates.
1451	1	a	Very good game. Really fun in groups and just do missions or mess around just ram raiding shops or causing complete mayhem on the streets of San Paro. Shame thing is there is a free to play type account, and a premium, which is better than free to play cos there are more features. But other than that, really good game, well, a good free game at least, worth the m....erm, i mean, free-ness?
1453	1	a	Good game - Best customization ive seen on any game, can be really good way to pass time and be quite a fun game, other times it can be extremely annoying or laggy as hell. It's very hard for new players to start this game as it is very pay to win, but if you can deal with it, it is an enjoyable game
1455	1	a	It's funny how Gamerslast spelled their name wrong
1457	1	a	I really liked this game, there is some problems with hackers but it looks like they get banned often. Combat is a little off balance but overall this is a great game.
1459	1	a	I know I put recommended, but it's only really because the game is free. It is extremely pay to play/win, but there is decent gear you can get for free. I did on the whole enjoy my time playing, but when the enemies had OP â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was EXTREMELY annoying. If you dont mind it taking quite a while to get good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and/or spending a few bucks, its great, otherwise, play a different game.
1461	1	a	Ok dispite of the reviews i went ahead and dowloaded this game.... It is soooo much fun probally increibly boring without freinds i always played with freinds and it was so much fun the car meachnics are great the cutomisation is great the gunplay is great the missons are ok not bad but ok and it runs pretty smooth considering i only have a gt 630 graphics card an i6 prosesser and 4 gigs of ram :D
1463	1	a	better than most mmo's that i have played
1465	1	a	The game is fun and has many hours of gameplay. Interesting and detailed customisation. However can have moments with bad match making.
1467	1	a	Great Game, only problem is You play againist Silvers &amp;&amp; Gold's when your Bronze Rank &gt;_&lt;   Pretty Stupid Match making i could say.
1469	1	a	Welcome to The Right side of life.
1471	1	a	A nice third person shooter that pits two factions against eachother in mission-based PVP. One of GamersFirst's finest in my opinion. You can gain standing through completing missions for contacts and climbing up in the ranks. Earn guns, clothing, cars, and more as you increase your standing and move up in the city of San Paro. There are three districts, the Financial district, the Waterfront distrect, and the Social district. The Financial and Waterfront district are the two main districts that use the PVP system. The Social district is where people go to sell items on the in game marketplace, pimp out their character, or just hang out. Overall I think APB Reloaded is a great game and I recommend it to all.
1473	1	a	Great game but only when u have Better graphics card..
1475	1	a	It ril ged 
1477	1	a	i really like this game
1479	1	a	Cheeky Scrub m8.
1481	1	a	Go ahead and play this game.  You will soon find out why players that only spend 40 hours on the game like it and why the players that have logged over 800 hours hate it.      Note: This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome; It has so much potential- It just has the world's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest Dev's I have ever seen.
1483	1	a	'I Would Recommend it To People That Love Cops And Robbers.' 
1485	1	a	So far, still extremely fun as hell. A lot of ways you can show off your creativity, and even though the missions are repeative, if you have a good team they can prove to be a bunch of fun.  10/10
1487	1	a	Verry good game :)!!!! I recommend it too you !!!
1489	1	a	Awesome Free Oper World Game!
1491	1	a	Honestly I didn't like this game at all, I don't know if I just joined a bad server or something, but it was just a major pain in the rear.  -I lagged constantly even with good internet and 30 or less ping -There were a lot of players that either spent money or farmed a lot that had MUCH better weapons than noobs making it unfair when they went and saught after the new guy while he/she is learning how to play. Out of the 100 minutes I spent on the game, I spent 60% of the time dead... -The graphics were not very good (mind you I played about a year or two ago... I do not know how much this game has changed since then...)  Other than that, the community seemed nice at the time, I just didn't find it fun.  6/10 I will recommend it, but probably wont play it again since it annoyed me so much XD.
1493	1	a	Awesome to play with friends.
1495	1	a	This Game Just Like Gta 5 And Saint Row Put Together. Its A Awsome Game I Love This Game. If U Can Buy Houses And Stay In Them This Game Will Be the best out of all them. But U Can Do Soo Much In This Game And It Free
1497	1	a	It's an ok game but it's free. Startup takes forever but besides that it's a good game.
1499	1	a	I love this game! It is very addictive, all the customization you could want. The match making is the only thing that I dont always like about this game.
1501	1	a	Ok heres the thing i'ts sort of like those games or toys thats a less a good version of something good. Sort off like a off brand, if you can't purchase Gta or Sleepingdogs or any open world games than play it. That's why its free I can't say its bad beacuse its free and it really doesnt matter. I like this game but its far off from anything close to a open world crime game. So heres what I rate it a 4/10 depends on which player you are. I would still just get it if you wan to have a little taste of a Open World Game.
1503	1	a	Not exactly Grand Theft Auto, but if it was, I wouldn't need to play to find out where it goes. The freedom to roam the streets as either Criminal or Enforcer is enticing, like playing Cops and Robbers except I actually get to riddle them full of holes.  Criminals can keep busy doing all kinds of things, breaking into store fronts and stealing merchandise, mugging people on the street, stealing vehicles and turning them into chop shops for a finders fee, making that money.   Enforcers on the other hand kind of get the short end of the stick. With few opportunities to make money outside of missions, progression obtaining better gear is a good bit longer, but without Enforcers, Criminals would have no one to fight. I think that Enforcers could use a bit more of a pick-me-up.  Guns. Honestly, outside of vehicular manslaughter, this is your only kill option, and frankly, I get bored with just guns. I would love to sneak up behind those Crims and put a blade between their ribs. So many opportunities would have been mine if there were a melee option.  Third person point of view kind of hurts the excitement a little bit, it's difficult to really pinpoint the reason behind it but I always feel a good bit more control in first person perspective.  Driving is a challenge, but I actually like it that way, learning all of the nuances to different vehicles, knowing when to start turning, take your foot off the gas, and put it back on to make that absurd u-turn, all the while laughing because everyone else is smacking into the walls, trying to catch up. Learning curves are sick...  Movement and running are okay, no real complaints, but interacting with the world? Doors, ladders, fences etc. is very primitive. You can Only climb from the bottom of the ladder to the top or vice versa, instead of being able to sit on the ladder from the perfect vantage point and open fire, or waiting for the perfect moment to climb that last rung. The only barriers you can climb over are predesignated chainlink and wooden fences so entries and escapes can only get so creative. Doors, you can only kick, you can't open slowly and maintain anonimity. The worst thing about it all I think, is that your name is brightly displayed over your character, even if only a hair on the top of your head is visible. No sneaking up in this game.  Story? There's supposed to be one, but personally I think it along with the missions and gameplay lack any real depth and character growth. It's basically glorified Team Deathmatch.  Temporary guns. To get anything permanent, takes tons of grinding. I'm not even going to get into this.  Customization? I think that Second Life could have done a lot better if they followed this games rules on customization, giving you basic shapes to work into your own design. This allows for great degrees of creativity, matched with a lack of graphic-produced lag, making for a comparitively fluid, yet personal experience. Just be sure to go into the customization with patience and a solid plan, and it'll come out great.  Pros  Customization Driving challenge Freedom to roam  Cons  Primitive movement Glowing names No melee Lack of depth   I think I'll keep playing on and off because it is a fun game, but I am actively looking for a replacement on my list, so let me call this a tentative recommendation.
1505	1	a	Fun game once you understand how the high ranks play, although you might bump into one or two hackers.
1507	1	a	I play this game to drive around in a car and listen to my music. Which I can not do in the real world.
1509	1	a	I've played this game more than 200h and its still fun. =DD
1511	1	a	If you're not Trucking, you're doing it wrong. If you don't know what Trucking is, you haven't even played the game.
1513	1	a	I like it.....its a more mission revolved GTA. And it's free... thumbs up!
1515	1	a	This is what GTA 5 would be if it were always online and even more violent as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
1517	1	a	a lot of bad reviews just get it i had an amazingly fun time just bring some friends ;)
1519	1	a	APB: Reloaded is a game that combines 3rd person over-the-shoulder shooting within a sprawling MMO world that is always changing. After a rough start with RTW (being a retail game with monthly subscription) it was closed and sooner or later picked up by K2 Networks. Formerly known as GamersFirst; K2 Networks set out to turn APB into the 'Free2Play' game it is today, complete with a Cash Shop *ridiculous prices.* Overall a decent game. The customization will keep you busy for hours. The balancing could use a little work and the server is straight up horrible at times. 'Hackusations' are common in every other match. Although actual hackers play, it's not as common as the game-chat would have you believe. Some people will tell you it's pay2win. I disagree. Get a friend, and use a mic! APB:R gets repetitive from the few game modes they give you (just in a different location). Defend this. Attack that. Shoot this. Repeat. I'd recommend this game to a group of friends looking to spend time on a fast paced game and don't mind getting their a** beat from balancing issues.
1521	1	a	..
1523	1	a	learn any language (english not included) for free
1525	1	a	Great way to past time really with friends this denf a squad game. c;
1527	1	a	Haven't played too much on this account but this game might not be the best anymore, but it is like a Cops'N'Robbers take on Saints Row, and both are loved by many and in conclusion, the game now isn't bad, still a little fun hourwaster. Kinda reminds me of CrimeCraft before they took it and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed it up with GangWars. Not a bad game. If you want a GTA-ish game, try it out!
1529	1	a	Best 3rd person shooter out there , and it's free! 
1531	1	a	Good game is good. Good game is free. You have no reason to not download it.
1533	1	a	PAY2WIN BUT IT FUN
1535	1	a	The game is nice, but in total ITS A PIECE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1537	1	a	in general this game is loads of fun, i love all the originality this games has from the customization to the the arsinal of guns you can use. the only complaint i have is the server lag, wich at times can be unplayable.
1539	1	a	Epic Multiplayer fun for the low price of zero.
1541	1	a	This Game is Awesome. The Unlimited Customization of Character And Cars makes it total worth a try. You create your own Identity or you copy an existing humanoid character from anywhere. Such as Ronald McDonald as an Example. I total Recommend this game if you like GTA and FPS Games
1543	1	a	So, If you like getting frustrated or yelling at your computer who did nothing to you..this is ya game, dawg  There's a love-hate relationship with this game so if you..y'know what, I'm going to go get some taco bell. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this.
1545	1	a	It is very fun, and Free to Play!
1547	1	a	one of the best games i have played  
1549	1	a	Great game with a lot of potential. Great customisation of your character, cars, clothing etc. There are some hackers on the game but it is pretty rare. The game is very addicting and once you get into the game it is pretty hard to quit. There are only 2 maps and you pretty much do the same missions which can get a bit boring but pretty fun. The ARMAS marketplace is constantly releasing new micro transactions or in game items which is maybe good on the one hand but also pretty bad in the other. Although the main thing is APB's player base which is pretty low and maybe even considered as dying off. All in all i think the game is great with a lot of ptential although has some major cons.
1551	1	a	This game is amazing, 10/10
1553	1	a	This game is interesting...could do some more work on it though.The servers are really laggy.But hopefully it will get better.Keep up the good work.:)
1555	1	a	I liked that the game can be played with friends on a private surver, one thing i disliked is the fact that youre character can become gasy and food that says redusces gassiness dose not.
1557	1	a	best multiplayer game I'v ever played. I recommaned It to all who love action filled multiplayer games:)
1559	1	a	this is a fun game you go around and shoot ppl stell cars play as a cop or a crook XD its pirtty fun sorda reminds me of gta :D hope some of u guys get it glhf :D
1561	1	a	i like the game its awesome
1563	1	a	got killed by a hacker       9/11 - would die again
1565	1	a	Fantastic Game. If you like the Saint's Row Serioes, you will absolutely FALL IN LOVE with this game.
1567	1	a	So after 10 Hours of creating my character, I join a district. After that, I saw that I needed to press K, so I did, and the objectice was close to me, (well thats fantastic) so I grab a car, drive to it and see 3 players in a car shooting directly at me, I tried to dodge, but their car squished me to a wall. I then died. Best game ever. 10/10. Brings a tear to my eye.
1569	1	a	Great and fun Open World game
1571	1	a	APB has tons of ways to customize and you can choose between being an enforcer or a criminal.
1573	1	a	It's like a GTA, but online.Visual very realistic and you can make tatooes,change cars and sounds.
1575	1	a	This game is sooo like gta 5 and the graphics are good and theres all different guns 2 choose :) 
1577	1	a	There is better ways to hurt yourself than playing this game.
1579	1	a	one hell of a amazing game! it it a bit comfusing at the start but it will get easyer  they should have a ranking system so you cant get in as a noob and meeting a pro that has played over a year    9/10
1581	1	a	One of those games I download every year or so, play for 5 minutes, then delete again. I love it.
1583	1	a	10/10 my friend begged me to get it again.
1585	1	a	Pros+++ +Character creation. +Customization. clothes,vechile,songs,etc. +Decent graphics. +Vehicles. +Lot of challenge. (Its not enough u know how to aim, u cant just run centre of street!) +Can find kind player too, true nerds, u can even buy zelda songs!  Cons--- -Matchmaking!! (U have to join bronze district if u silver or lower threat!) -Toxic/cheating community like most of competive games. -Devs dont to right thinks to improve game. -Some of guns are bit p2w. -Sometimes game lag when it get ddosed. -Car spawnz are op! -Fog of war. -No headshots. -Mission reward low without premium.  Still better game than cs go.
1587	1	a	fun big learning curve
1589	1	a	Fun, free to play, Cops and robbers! Monthly challenges and good atmosphere.
1591	1	a	I adore the game! Yes it has its bugs and still will be developing throughout time, but its fairly fun for the free game it is. The character customizing and designing ideas is fabulous and the ideas of doing tasks for each boss is very interesting. I give this game 4 out of 5 Bazookas!
1593	1	a	Ok dispite of the reviews i went ahead and dowloaded this game.... It is soooo much fun probally increibly boring without freinds i always played with freinds and it was so much fun the car meachnics are great the cutomisation is great the gunplay is great the missons are ok not bad but ok and it runs pretty smooth considering i only have a gt 630 graphics card an i6 prosesser and 4 gigs of ram :D
1595	1	a	1/10 Would not load again.
1597	1	a	Awesome game if u expect cheaters/hackers !!!
1599	1	a	Definately has a GTA feel to it, but with insane customization, while it is fun to play free, I would 100% reccomend buying premium, however, G1, the company that owns the game, is completly money hungry as well as a tad â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as far as sever connection goes, but even with this, it is still a game that is very addictive, and very fun!
1601	1	a	10/10 game exept for the cheaters and the lag spikes ;D
1603	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 10/10
1605	1	a	Fun when not having to deal with server/lag issues
1607	1	a	PvP + Action + Open World + Advanture + Nudity = OH YAHH  i Really Recommend This Game   P.S: Store system really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i mean  WTF Virtual Paid Weapons And Cloths  This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t  any way i recommend this game
1609	1	a	Countless hours of entertainment, very good game, and it's free... what more is there to ask?
1611	1	a	very good game!! but almost full of hackers :)
1613	1	a	Free, Online, Cops and Robbers, Whats Not to Love? Just get it You'll Understand
1615	1	a	Amazing game of pvp where friends and family will love to play!
1617	1	a	criminals are how you normally play the game enforcers are grade a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing scum they wait like cadavering(?) annoying pests and wait for you to get up a high amount of loot from farming the npcs by mugging them or doing ram raids then they waltz in like the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s they are, wait for the computer to give them a mission to stop you and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing shoot you in the face and steal all your hard work and money in about 5 seconds flat. 0/10 hate this game
1619	1	a	There is better ways to hurt yourself than playing this game.
1621	1	a	DUCK THE POLICE (Ja DUCK the police deal with it)
1623	1	a	Asian Player Models &amp; Pay To Win Everywhere.
1625	1	a	Okay, I like this game so I'm gonna list the pros and cons:  Pros. Good graphics Smooth car handling Easy to start You can be in groups  Cons. Servers shut down frequently BlingLords with over 9000 rank try to blow/gun you down any chance they get (these people can only do this if they're in a different faction) A tiny bit confusing
1627	1	a	I took out 3 snipers using bricks 11/10   (Also IF you see a reveiw saying this game is P2W its really not if u have the skill u can deystroy ANY weapon u find in the Armas Market i would say this game is more like P2C=Pay to Convience which bascially means ur able to get bttr modded weapons quicker BUT i will say there WAS one p2w gun that they NERFED which was the Vas r2 Troublemaker which so OP that it could out gun a sniper at long ranges Sometimes)
1629	1	a	This is my favorite game ! But you can add some new events like races clan battles or something like this!
1631	1	a	I loved uninstalling this!
1633	1	a	I made a boobie girl character and my friend was very excited. Better times, better times.
1635	1	a	Imagine if you put aids and terminal cancer together, then made it a game this is what would come out of it.   Welcome to AidsPointsBulletin one of the worst managed free to play games you've ever seen. Bundled with the worst anti cheat anyone has ever seen in their life and players with brains as equally as smart as dead sperm cells.

1643	1	a	Imagine if you put aids and terminal cancer together, then made it a game this is what would come out of it.   Welcome to AidsPointsBulletin one of the worst managed free to play games you've ever seen. Bundled with the worst anti cheat anyone has ever seen in their life and players with brains as equally as smart as dead sperm cells.

1647	1	a	i like 2 kill things and steal things it allows me to act like a criminal from the relative safety of my home 10/10 game would recommend
1649	1	a	Has its querks, but worth playing, even just on and off.

1653	1	a	its ok. if you start new now its really hard to git gud
1655	1	a	If you want a game that gives you a raging hardon all the time no matter what, get this game. I should probably get this checked out by my doctor..
1657	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME ON THE PLANET. WHEN I'M NOT SURE MY 'F' KEY IS WORKING I ALWAYS LOAD UP MY FAVORITE TESTING PLATFORM, APB. WHEN LIFE IS GREAT AND I NEED TO BE BROUGHT DOWN A BIT I ENJOY A GAME FULL OF PAY TO WIN, EXPLOITING, AND BUILT-IN ANTI FUN MECHANICS THAT MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE THROWING YOUR MOUSE OUT THE WINDOW BY THE END OF THE NIGHT.  10/10.
1659	1	a	hell yea best game ever
1661	1	a	Anyone else remember the time when you could put images on certain billboards? Yeah, Hentai, HENTAI EVERYWHERE!
1663	1	a	Best 3rd person shooter out there , and it's free! 
1665	1	a	f2p gta online. solid gameplay and fun gamestyle
1667	1	a	Really fun to play with friends and just fool around or get serious and have a few games here and there. Been a long player and re-discovered this jewel on Steam a while back. Too bad that the servers have gone to ****, framerate problems and the skillcap to play is just too high for new gamers to get into. Every person is a pro or either a hacker, no new players to be found. If you're ready for a hard ride and have some friends who are into shooters then go on and play this.
1669	1	a	I like the game, but not sure about the anti-cheat system.
1671	1	a	Love this game!!! Its sooo cool! BEST GAME EVER! YOU SHALL PLAY IT!!!!!!
1673	1	a	this is a great game and i been playing it for 2+ years, still don't get bored of it!!! 
1675	1	a	This game is real example of hard work, this game has perfect engine and MMO world so I must say that this game is really good, gameplay is awesome, driving is less hard but don't matter. Anyway, this game is #1 from MMO games with 3rd Person View, no more words. AWESOME GAME! :)
1677	1	a	the best gamr ever 
1679	1	a	Ok, this is my first review, but I will try my best.   APB:Reloaded. I dare think that, after several hundreds of gameplay, i still enjoy this game. It has some good and some bad sides, like any other game. First of all, it has a HUGE customization capacity: you can customize nearly everything of your character and car. Unfortunately, its matchmaking system is the biggest flaw. I am a gold threat player, and I am forced to play in Silver threat districts, for the gold ones are almost empty. Some p2w weapons surely exist, but they can be defeated with teamplay (it is a must: a good team is the most important thing) or with some excellent f2p weapons, like Colby PMG. So, if you can find a good team you enjoy playing with, this is one of the best f2p games I enjoyed so far. Anyway you should have a badass computer, and a relly good connection: expect lag if not. A whole lot of it.  Be ready for sad moments, but also for a lot of fun if you want to play apb. I hope my grammar was correct. Now the servers should be back online, so see you in the game!
1681	1	a	The game gave me bluescreens all the time, it is a pay to win game mostly (cars and weps). Except this its good
1683	1	a	it is awesome have hade a lot of fun in the past and now time kill cops
1685	1	a	THE BEST AROUUUNNNDDD (:
1687	1	a	cooool game Action
1689	1	a	LOVE IT 
1691	1	a	Great game, so much fun fighting it out against the enforcers as a criminal. The customization in this game is amazing!
1693	1	a	 TL:DR  Good game, community bandwagon raging about random stuff that doesn't exist as big as they make it sound   So there are a lot of people screaming 'Over powered gunz' and stuff like that, it's really kinda absurd. I played this game F2P for about a year before I bought Premium and I really haven't noticed a difference other than an XP boost and a few customization increases here and there, which I don't use because art to me may as well be a trashcan.  -Yes you can buy guns, are they more powerful? By default, yes. But they have massive draw backs and are really a case by case basis, and F2P guns that you can get can be modified to be more powerful than a paid gun.   -Is the community toxic? Yeah, kinda...A lot. You find a few snowflakes here and there who are nice.  -Population has been really good recently I personally haven't noticed a difference and I'm primarily on HAN, I still see people complaining but I'm willing to blame that on people jumping on the band wagon.  -Hackers? Not really..I've seen a total of 2, in about 3 years of playing, (Yes my hours are low, I played on and off for those years and originally started off with the standard APB launcher, instead of through Steam). Yes I understand they exist, but people say it's covered in hackers which I disagree with.  -Matchmaking. One thing I hear a lot is 'Match making iz broke'...It's really not, the game finds you a match based on the most suitable players, I'd rather get my â™¥â™¥â™¥ kicked by some R255 then waiting 50 minutes for a match, and more often than not being paired against a R255 I can still hold my own meaning I'm getting paired with people of a similar skill level to me. Personally, I've rarely noticed the match making have any issues.  (I remember it used to have major issues, but they did fix that sometime this year, I think it was)  Overall this game is fun, it's well made, bugs are minimal and are patched quite quickly, I personally really enjoy what this game has to offer, I haven't been able to find a game similar to it and really enjoy it due to that.  Yes the Engine update is like..3 years late now? But really, I'd enjoy the engine update, but the game works fine so I see no issue.  There's so many things you can do within combat alone, depending on what enviroment your in and what weapon you're using as well as what faction. For example.  I play Enforcer, commonly less than lethal, now instead of killing people it tazes them, no it's not instant and it's a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ to do but it's fine, and once tazed you may arrest the criminal, keeping them in respawn for longer. Most commonly people will go Lethal, that's your shooty bullets that kill you, yes they hurt, and weapons in that category ranges from sniper rifles to machine guns to shotguns, the diversity of weapons is great.  Then there's the massive customization options, regarding vehicles &amp; players, even death music if you're that type of person, which I won't get to into because I'm a trash designer.  Finally your clans, you can get just your friendly clans or 'pro' clans, mostly always have some form of a symbol on them and roll around in force, which makes the game a lot easier for the people in clans as you aren't getting paired with randoms, and let's face it...Randoms aren't really people you wanna be with.  This game's 'Flaws' that the community rages about are blown out of the water, most players are just bad and blame it on hacks, or 'bugs' like most games.  I just edited this for the Steam badge Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
1695	1	a	Overall its a pretty epic and unique Pvp open world game. Dont listen to all people that try to make it look bad just because they dont know how to be good at the game.  Its not pay2win! U can beat armas weapons very good with non cash weapons. The best weapons like Ntec, PMG, OCA and HVR are all FREE FOR IN GAME MONEY at contacts.  It just takes much time to learn the game (map knowledge, tactics, weapon control and more).   And its also NOT full of cheaters. Of course there are cheaters but its not even half that worse like in many other f2p games. This Game uses Fairfight Anti Cheat. Fairfight monitores how someone is playing (Check  FFBANS.ORG  to see most banned players from APB).  The customization possibilities of APB are just unique. U can almost make every design you want on your cars and clothing :) (Thats why it needs this high amount of RAM) Well about performance its not very optimized because its a old unreal engine version very heavy modified.  Engine upgrade for PC should come after they released the Ps4 version on which they currently working on. But it can run well at 40-60fps when u own a good 4 core Cpu, 8 GB of Ram (its waaay more CPU and RAM intense than GPU intense) and a Gpu with 1 - 1,5Gb of Vram. Of course it depends on your Graphic settings. You can make more detailed graphics Settings with Advanced APB Launcher (search APB forums to find the download for it)..   So give it a try and start learning and u will see its just great.
1697	1	a	Ignore all the people that say bad devs, it's a half truth. It has devs, and some updates, but it has very FEW devs. They are in Dev hell, play and support, its in a hole.   Play atleast, make friends, they will keep you playing. You don't have to spend money, atleast give them numbers so they can get support another way. This game can easily become number one.
1699	1	a	good game but i suggest you get a group of friends before you play since you get trolls alot that will kill you for no reason but other than that it is a good game has good gameplay
1701	1	a	Its a fun game to play with your friends or just solo.  But if you wanna get good...  be ready to get your mom's credit card.  
1703	1	a	I personally think this was one of the best games ever put onto the market. Yes there was major glitches, cheating problems, and bugged missions in the end but it was still an amazing game. The game kind of put you into the life of a person, being criminal or enforcer, that you got to control and live out their life. The customization was almost perfect, there were glitches in editors, glitches in applying decals, etc, but nothing that couldn't have been fixed with a few new patches. I think the reason why people did not really get into this game is the fact they didn't play with regular groups of people whilst talking to them in TeamSpeak or Ventrillo. To me when I played this with my group of friends it just felt like we were a real gang of criminals, it was just an amazing feeling and you could really get close to the people you were playing with and it almost felt as if you were really with them. I just think this game had MASSIVE potential and if it had the right funding it could have been probably one of the biggest games in history. People like Savino, JusticeMortice, and other hackers just ruined the community. Nobody liked them and they just acted like total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bags and ruined the game with their aimbots. I think if the game had more time to fix all the bugs and fix their anti cheat system it could have been the most amazing game. I mean even as it was I would play around 5 hours a day at least. Thats a lot for a person like me, before this game id maybe play a game once a week for about an hour? I think even with repetitive missions this was one of the most entertaining games ever. I truly will miss this game, and I am sad to never have seen it grow into the game it could have been with some more time and funding. It makes me sad to see this one go. Also all the people who based their review off the first week of gameplay, they fixed pretty much everything with the driving that nobody liked, and just everything that was wrong in the beginning with GAMEPLAY was fixed. Not weapons and that stuff but everything else was fixed and running perfect. Especially the drifting in cars, most amazing drifting I have ever seen in a game. R.I.P APB
1705	1	a	I recommend you look for the top Recommendation notes for this game, Personaly I think this game is awesome!
1707	1	a	Very fun game but needs some improvment
1709	1	a	Poor mans GTA with twice the cancer. Devs don't care and community is very poor. This however, has kept me entertained for quite a while. So it may work for you. Just don't sink any money into this, its not worth it.
1711	1	a	APB Reloaded is a open world cops and robbers set gameplay. Im going to go through pros and cons of th game Pros- Very fun gameplay  PvP is great Missions are very enjoyable with friends Noob friendly UI  Cons- Very much pay to win Scrubbies everywhere with $100 guns spraying you down   Be sure to join bronze and silver ques or you will get destroyed!!!  I would reccomend but be prepared to spend $20-$50 on guns, clothes etc...
1713	1	a	As many people have already said, the game is pretty much P2W, but ignoring that fact the game is great. The characters and vehicles are more customisable than a Subway sandwich, and if you grab 2 or 3 friends the game is infinitely better and more fun. Granted, some people may have trouble running the game for issues that they blame on the game, and hell the issues might actually be because of the game, but if you can run the game smoothly, you have some friends to play with, and you encounter few P2Ws then the game will be great. Sometimes you have to ignore the cons and focus on how awesome the pros are to properly enjoy a game.
1715	1	a	Very Nice
1717	1	a	literally full of kids that cant afford csgo so they play this garbage
1719	1	a	I have never spent a dime on this game and had an amazing time. I haven't played it via steam, but I love all the 2k+ hr guys saying it is not good. It is kind of like a simple version of GTA with awesome customization and PvP. Even just driving around the city is fun. Don't spend any money if you don't like it, you don't have to in order to play.
1721	1	a	Am i the only one whos running APB fine? all these bad reviews and im not even crashing or getting exploded or Geting Aids or cancer, Its a Good game as long as u dont â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game files XD
1723	1	a	Great..
1725	1	a	everybody is so butthurt becuse ftp has p2w but ofcourse they have it stupid if you make a free game and make so it doesnt have eny way to pay real money in it then wtf like you made aa game for millions and millions of dollars and then have no way to get payed for it you woudnt earn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for the game you spend millions of money making so next time you find a ftp game dont be so butthurt about pay to win
1727	1	a	Pros :   - Its Free!  - Character Customization is pretty good.  - Decent fighting  Cons :  - Its Pay2Win but anybody with common sense will do 'Fine'  - A little buggy.  - The driving Mechanics is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible.  - Kind of un-optimized.  Well that about sums it up about this game its pretty decent and its not what i expected. 7.5/10
1729	1	a	The game is pretty fun to play with your friends but boring to play alone. It doesn't matter if your F2P or P2P you still have chance and the game is pretty balanced. Overall a very great game.
1731	1	a	It's a fun game, kind of like GTA, but not as sexual or 'rude'.  It could be fixed abit more, like things need to be more balanced (guns mostly), but over all earns a 4.5/5 stars by me.
1733	1	a	how do i say this, its like a hybrid of marijuana and cancer, it can spread to people, its cancerous, its addicting and it makes you wanna killyourself
1735	1	a	Review Date: 31.03.2016 My pc specs.  Screen: BenQ 27' 3D LED XL2720Z (1920x1080, 144Hz, 1ms, 12m:1, VGA/DVI/2xHDMI/DP) AMD FX (tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor (8 CPUs), -4.0GHz NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 (4gb Memory) 24576MB Memory  MINI REVIEW â€“ APB Reloaded  The Good â˜ºTons of character/weapon/car/clothes/midi customising/modding â˜ºVery fast group system, just to push K â˜ºeasy to unlock weapons, just pledge to one dealer and you on to it.. â˜ºthe stuff you unlock ingame like weapons/cars/mods aint to expensive so you can buy and try them out for a period of time, and you learn Skills with weapons after using then wich also leads to unlock of newer weapons. â˜ºIt have a nice tutorial pushing you through most of what the game has to offer :) â˜ºoffers ton of fun with friends, once you get the hang of the guns and dont get insane â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by ppl saying 'hack this and hack that'  The Bad â˜¹It can have a stuttering lag now and then, its like the game runs smooth just in missions or pvp that one time lag can lead to a quick death, but its not to often visible thank god. â˜¹You can pay for elite weapons with alot of nice mods installed on them for real cash, same goes for cool cars, way better than f2p part if you aint using alot ALOT of time to unlock everything. â˜¹A pvp grindfest and it can get old fast if you aint loving that :), cause the main mission is often attack or defend typish..  â˜¹No first person view for sniper mode, hehe not bad just really want to se that in the game. â˜¹Very expensive shop, and it can get alittle confusing how to manouver as a new player!  Worth Noting The game itself is easy to master and to understand, you will be put straight into a brutal battle, either you decide to rob shops as a criminal or mission with other players ;).  May-Aug 2015 Roadmap (they are somewhat alittle after on some parts still): â€¢Completion of all EU District Server Upgrades (NOW LIVE!) â€¢Joker Mystery Box 17: Urban Legends (NOW LIVE!) â€¢EU PC Server Merge â€¢US PC Server Merge â€¢Espacio Season Pass â€¢Refer-A-Friend â€¢CRISP: Community Moderation System â€¢New Matchmaking Release â€¢PC Engine Upgrade Release â€¢PS4 Launch and Xbox One Launch   The Verdict: This game has alot to offer for both f2p players and the VIP cash boys, if you look for a casual/semi active  game this might just be it, that said you are loving the GTA style gameplay.. Chat can somewhat be alittle harse with players mostly crying/â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing over hackers etc. im sure there are some out there i have not seen any yet!  this game has improved alot since the old 2011 APB, but sadly if your looking for alot of changes they have not given any difference game missions just 2 pvp modes mostly..   I have had alot of fun playing it with friends, and it pushes my heartrate up when trying to reach checkpoint after checkpoint.  'I really recommend players to try it out, i know there will be alot maybe against me giving it a THUMBS UP'  (i am sorry if there are some spelling mistakes  Cheers Mspaint out
1737	1	a	Entered the game bought g1c got the euryale  banned 11/10 whould defentily buy again
1739	1	a	game isnt p2w (almost all of the guns that cost $$ are reskins of guns you can get in game for free) and the ones that arent reskins are trash excluding a couple, and if you arent a complete idiot you can easily get by with the starter gun or just use in game money to rent guns which are all pretty much good  other than that having 'premium' only offers more customization and easier progression in the game (it is a shooter rpg not a tps) and the progression doesnt even get you anything useful except modifications and vehicles which you can just buy from other users using in game money anyway  in my experience hackers exist but it isnt a prevalent issue kinda like cheaters in csgo its not terribly common but it definetely exists except you see less crying in csgo, which is a game you actually paid money for so Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯  game isnt 100% amazing though, the company is pretty slow with content releases beyond new weapons, the matchmaking could use an overhaul and community can be toxic af  overall the game is nowhere near as bad as most people think it is i would reccommend giving it a try but hey you know this is just coming from someone with ~4 years of playing on and off so the reviews where dumbasses have a couple hours played and only cry about p2w or hacking are probably more valuable tbh  also my steam hours for apb arent accurate since i played a lot off steam
1741	1	a	got ip banned ayyeeee
1743	1	a	This game is not pay to win, people who suck at the game say those type of things. Also if you're even remotely good, be prepared to be hackusated. People just cant handle an â™¥â™¥â™¥ kicking. I love the game. 10/10
1745	1	a	I spent an entire summer building a character and leveling him; all while enjoying myself and not spending any money, only to find that I have a lifetime/non negotiable ban on my account. So as a sane person I decided my time with APB was done. Fun game, except for that.
1747	1	a	Lol I never actually played this
1749	1	a	 TL:DR  Good game, community bandwagon raging about random stuff that doesn't exist as big as they make it sound   So there are a lot of people screaming 'Over powered gunz' and stuff like that, it's really kinda absurd.

1755	1	a	it is very fun.
1757	1	a	Best third person game
1759	1	a	very nice game 
1761	1	a	APB:Relaoded is kinda full of bugs and flaws, but its highly addictive and tons of fun. Its one of the best games i've ever played and one of the worst at the same time. I totally recommend it for everyone who like 3rd person shooters, since its for free and u cant do anything wrong on something thats for free ;)
1763	1	a	Take a dive into the deep unknown of the criminal domain. Choose the good side or the bad side in a epic game of cops and robbers. Will you dive into the Criminal World where you rob stores and hold up people for everything they got. Or will you choose the good side of the law as a cop where you drive around in your car and shoot people for no reason. The choice is yours in this adventurous game of the year.  10/10 - BrandonMoore.TV
1765	1	a	I hate this game.
1767	1	a	It's quite the spectacle.
1769	1	a	Don't Know What To Write . Just Give It A Like
1771	1	a	Second Life/GTA hybrid that allows you to be a cop too. Pay 2 be pretty not pay to win. EVERYTHING available in real money market is achievable in game, exception being aesthetic items (e.g. gun skins, clothing items, etc).  11/10 will fap moar  p.s. Waifus... waifus errywhere....
1773	1	a	this game is best game for me :D that's fun when people say you hacker when your not.Most thing that i love it is that it is free game i didnt pay for any thing and im gold. i think u have to fight for your level like be bronz and gold and silver and ... that's bets game :D APB RELOADED (when i was a kid)  Well know APB reloaded is a boring game for those who play it 1000/... houre, but it is still a good game,and i love to spend my time on it(a bit)
1775	1	a	6/10, This Game Is Easy To Pick Up And Play. But to have some Luck, you need to Devote.  So many of you may already know of this game like me, But this games i gave a 6/10 because the gameplay, the customisation, all of that. Strip it away for a second and see how the game is built. ARMAS - Providing Players with the option to buff their Chars/Accounts with weapons and cars. PREMIUM - Allows Players to futher their customisation and earn more money from missions. Those two are the biggies that get me down. Because i love the customisation that those 2 allow me to expand in and yes i do get that they need money somehow but whenever i log on i think about Patches. A patch where we can trade JT or $ For G1C (GamerfirstCredits.) So overall i have a fun time in the game and it's exactly why I've got almost 150 hours into the game.  If Yu Wanna Play with Me I Will Either Be on Enforcer - OfficerBanshee Criminal - Quanzy Don't ask me where I got my names from. LONG STORY _________________  Mr. Retro Signing Off - I Reccomend this if you are willing to put hours upon end into this game ;)
1777	1	a	Really cool game, a lot of customization! While it's pay to win, you can dominate every player, just depends on how good you are in the game! And really, It's free. You have nothing to lose! :)
1779	1	a	pretty good game enjoy playing.
1781	1	a	Pay2Win in a nutshell. The game has a magnificant concept but it has been executed terribly. You can't stand up against people who have paid for the game in both customization and actual PvP. However, the games funny physics and hilarious outfits, it surely does bring a few laughs, especially when you group up with a pair of buddies. It's an incredibly fun game aslong as you have a fair game, and if you don't mind paying for a game to have fun, this is recommended - Aslong as you got a good enough computer to handle it!
1783	1	a	After playing this game I strongly recommend you to play this game and not read any of the non recommended games. To me personal this game is like every other game hard at first but you get the hang of it and it becomes fun! Whats a game without challenge!! Besides, it's free whats their to lose? I strongly recommend this game to anyone! A fun GTA 5 like Game with a good servers that are almost all the time full with 100 people!
1785	1	a	This game is very hard to eat and play at the same time! Be warned.
1787	1	a	RIKKAYBOBBAY APPROVES... I WANNA GO FAST AND GARBAGE BOMB YOU WITH MEATBALLTONY
1789	1	a	The game has been getting better and I love the way everything is designed within the game. It feels great to play and the strongest weapons are free to play, dont let anyone tell you otherwise.
1791	1	a	I do enjoy this game. Many people comment upon the fact that the game was spoiled. I agree with this statement to an extent. For the first couple of week playing the game, It's extremely fun, But after a while it become repetitive and boring, but this is after a long time.   Pay To Win:  This game as covered in pay to win items, but this is understandable since it is a f2p game. Anything that you can buy with money, you can earn legit through hard work in-game. So its just really booster packs. The only exceptions to this is apparel and vehicles. Some of the best weapons in the game you can simply buy on the in-game marketplace with in-game money.   Team Balancing:  Team balancing is horrendous. I have had experiences of being on a team with bronze threats (2nd lowest threat level, I'm a silver), And been against a team of gold threats. The reason this occurs is due to the fact that the punishment for gold threats playing on a silver threat server is next to nothing. This is an easy way for gold threats to play, because they are against silvers and bronzes. And they are not getting punished for doing so. Due to this, The gold threat servers are gathering dust.   Enforcers VS Criminal:    Enforcers have a MASSIVE advantage over Criminals, E.G.:   Having the ability to arrest us, and then kill us (because the penalty for doing so is next to non-existent)   Having all of the apb veterans on their side, This is a massive issue.    Repetitive:  Apb has got repetitive, I mean like.. Stressfully repetitive. Players are forced to grind for weeks, playing every single day of the week to be able to catch up to the opposite teams. They are forced to do the same thing over and over and over again. This is one of the main reasons I don't really play this game anymore.    Conclusion:  In conclusion, despite what I have said, I would recommend this game to a very specific audience. That audience would be:   Willing to spend quite allot of money on a game.   Willing to grind for weeks on end   Willing to do the same thing over and over again   Willing to enjoy something like this   Willing to put up with the unfair team balancing   -TheKillerToaster
1793	1	a	I am making this city safe from Crime!   By shooting people with assault rifles &amp; shotguns running over civilians and standing in a circle.  I'M MAKING A DIFFRENCE
1795	1	a	Good game, wouldn't call it awesome though, if you like shooting the crap out of people, but it's pretty laggy/â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1797	1	a	- Had a lvl94 Enforcer account - Some criminal shouted 'PRESS K FOR PREMIUM' - I Press k, - Got a team of bronze while im gold and against me team of Ursus, Sitting duck and Raptor + Bloodymary, - Was 1v1'ing against someone with sitting duck and got jump shotted, - Teammates was spraying all around the map with ntecs hoping to hit and kill someone - Respawned in a car like nothinghappend, - I get out of the car and suddenly I get run over by the new IO GROWL, - Ragequitted and went to my other maxout account.  10/10 Would get ran over again.

1801	1	a	One of the best games EVER played, it's like BF Hardline, World of Warcraft, GTA V, Watch Dogs and Sleeping Dogs ALL together I'd definitely recommend it. Best thing is, no matter how good you are xD even girls can kick ya a$$ out there.
1803	1	a	Love the ple the APB!

1809	1	a	awesome game i came back to it after i started to hate it for community 2 years ago. its good to be back on the streets of san paro wastin everybody :D i recommend this game for everyone who is looking for an amazing free multiplayer experience! on a note for all gpu maxers do not use vsync and framerate smoothing together or you will have heavy mouse and keyboard input lag!
1811	1	a	The best part of this game is the button that allows you to uninstall it :D
1813	1	a	Game is different seems almost to pay to win and most the community is toxic
1815	1	a	F*ckin' nice game!
1817	1	a	  It's really the little things that ruin this game, it's so good but so bad. Every time I play this game I can't help but think that maybe, just maybe g1 and reloaded would care enough to make this game what it was supposed to be. I recommend this game to anyone who loves customization. The gameplay is nice too and the community is split between real nice people and the ones who are salty as hell. In the end, just give it a try it's free after all. ^u^
1819	1	a	Truely addictive shooter, loads of fun and great customization ^_^
1821	1	a	this is amazing game any one need to play
1823	1	a	The game is great! i love it. The only things i think it needs are  -first person mode -melee weapons (knife, bat etc) -a selectable option that makes you pay %200 more money to buy a weapon permanetly instead of for 10 days -mission select and mission vote (to vote for wich mission you want) -more damage on headshots (I REALLY REALLY WANT THIS PLEASE ADD) -when you get to natoriety 4, enforcers (any enforcer) can kill you -more opertunities to get weapons permanetly without using G1C (level rewards, mission rewards etc)
1825	1	a	I love this game but it's pay to win. I understand that the creators have to get an income sometime, but they could atleast in the future make it pay to play instead of pay to win or do a give away for the holaday's and give everyone who does some challanges a gun or a car kit or something like that.
1827	1	a	The highs are really high, the lows are really frequent.  Though not as much lately!  I've been playing APB on and off since RTW beta and it honestly does just keep getting tighter and better all the time. I can't for the life of me persuade anyone to return to give it another chance, though.  The customisation options alone mark this out as something special, but managing to have a roughly working game where 100 players can drive around in their custom vehicles in their custom outfits playing their customised theme tunes having non-instanced PvP missions against each other on a huge map is even more of an achievement.  It's not GTA and it doesn't have fancy euphoria physics or anything, but when it's good none of that matters.
1829	1	a	Even if it's not the action that keeps you playing, just messing around in the social district and designing logos, tattoos and whatnot can be reason enough to dl this title. LOVE IT
1831	1	a	Free 2 Plays are the great.
1833	1	a	This is the WORST game I have ever played. Every single problem you could have with a game, this right here caters to it. It has 20 minuite loading screens, more micro transactions than any game I have EVER seen, and lags to all hell. But it is some of the most amusing 15 minuites you will ever have with friends.
1835	1	a	Fun game but too much hackers &gt;.&gt;
1837	1	a	Love this game, Just starting the game up, with the very broken launcher, to get in a server full of hackers/cheaters it not the best thing to come into when you have spend like half hour fixing the launcher :s
1839	1	a	Realy good gameplay mechanics, lots of fun with friends, and what i love the most, is the consumazations you can do there, its one of the best ive seen so far, so much to do and so much to make, lets say your imagination is your creation. you can make your own style, design your car, and even design your own music and alot more stuff to do. But if you want the full experience you need to pay for it, so you are kinda limited to what you can make, thats the only bad thing i can say about it, but the free version is alot of fun to, if you like Gta types of games, multiplayer competetive and co-op , i realy recommend this ;)
1841	1	a	        YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Bro Team Pill: APB&nbsp;
1843	1	a	It's ok I guess.
1845	1	a	Fun,Buitefuk Graphics and awesome gameplay but pretty reapitve So i dont suggest this so much, but it is A fun game :D --------TRY IT OUT-------- problems : Are u lagging much like me like 25 - 18 fps then u should make the graphics really ugly Sorry D:
1847	1	a	Even though this game is Pay-To-Win which i don't normally play, it's the only Pay-To-Win game i enjoy  Pro's  - You can customize pretty much everything - Graphics are nice - Loads of things to do like missions/pvp/social/chill   Con's  - PvP Feels Unbalanced - Pay-To-Win - Toxic Players join your missions.  Overall Rating: 8.5/10
1849	1	a	Love this game, Just starting the game up, with the very broken launcher, to get in a server full of hackers/cheaters it not the best thing to come into when you have spend like half hour fixing the launcher :s
1851	1	a	APB, Played it for so much that I have have been so attached to it. I recomend it for anyone who likes GTA Type games
1853	1	a	I've never played this game
1855	1	a	This game is like Yoyaz's house.Dark and full of wierd smells.
1857	1	a	Its like Saints row, but free
1859	1	a	best shooter game ever good quality and great graphics i really recommend getting this game
1861	1	a	Definitely a game with a lot of potential.. Although their servers are a bit dusty, it doesn't mean that the game isn't worth trying out. You can spent a lot of hours just trying to customize your character, running around like a cop or a criminal. If it's possible, try to get some of your friends to play it with you. I wouldn't say that you need to play with friends, but games are always funnier when you can play them with your friends! (:
1863	1	a	  plz fix game freezing ;-;
1865	1	a	It's like eating â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and drinking diarrhea at the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time. Basically it's just bad
1867	1	a	GTA Online, basically.  Get this game. Mostly due to the fact that it's free to play, but also because its a solid game. It has a lot in common with the extremely popular GTA franchise, with its massive open-world, car stealing, citizen killing and varied weapon selection, but it obviously lacks a coherent story, since it's mostly a Massively Multiplayer Online game, so if you're looking for story, don't try this game. If you're looking for quick fun, action packed gameplay, try it out.   The customization is INSANE in this, you'll probably spend a few hours just to create your character. And the customization doesnt stop here: weapons, clothing (you can customize the clothings, not just what your character is weraing, meaning you can not only change colors but apply designs, logos, emblems, etc on them) and the many vehicles are 100% customizable (and usually upgradable aswell)  Thanks to its random missions and its nice PVP mode, the replayability is extremely high in this game. Just jump in and play.  Graphics 10/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Replayability 14/15 Gameplay 12/15  Overall - 9/10
1869	1	a	Great game and its a little pay to win but once you level up a bit and understand the gunplay the pay to win aspect of the game is gone and the amount of custimization is out of this world insane. I love the game and could not recomend it more.
1871	1	a	Its like Saints row, but free
1873	1	a	^_^
1875	1	a	i really like this game but the controles are wierd and the the graphics has false advertise
1877	1	a	Only after 800 hours of this game do i truly know the nature of this game, the grind is real however p2w is existant and a bitter community drag down the overall experience. There is a faulty match making system which can pit 1000 hour veterans towards new recuits starting the game. Nudity and overall sexuality is overwhelmingy evident throughout the game, Social District being a prime example. Despite the games countless downfalls such as consistent lag spikes, the game reaches a level of customization that is not matched by other games. The total verdict of this game is 10/10 would recommend Fak you give me money.
1879	1	a	Amazing game, Love it cant stop playing it. It is a lot better if you have a freind/freinds with you. Though still an amazing game I play as cop most (not alot of cop players) but not alot of things to do sadly  
1881	1	a	If you want a good free game, this game is for you!!!
1883	1	a	Like it to death
1885	1	a	I havent played this on steam but i did on the original website and i â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ loved it you can get gangs have fun arrest people if you play this you will get good memories of this game
1887	1	a	APB reload is a fun open world cop vs robbers game and yeah there is a few bugs here and there but over all a greatgame and yes you need a somwhat good computer to run but its woth it so go have fun
1889	1	a	i recommend this game. its like a free gta..
1891	1	a	Gta is better :P (ofc)
1893	1	a	A Fun remake of GTA For the PC For Free â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥IT!!
1895	1	a	Community is Terrible. Gameplay servers use dial up. 0/10
1897	1	a	If you want a good free game, this game is for you!!!
1899	1	a	Fun game. Free to play but Buy to win.
1901	1	a	Love this game, Just starting the game up, with the very broken launcher, to get in a server full of hackers/cheaters it not the best thing to come into when you have spend like half hour fixing the launcher :s
1903	1	a	after 28h of playing i can recomend the game to everyone.It may not have the best physics o graphics but i dont know bout the others buti found the community very good.You can pretty much ask anywhere for help and when you first log into the game you'll be welcome from everyone and the tutorial is very effective too.The game concept is good the side missions are fun the optimization might not be perfect but it is good enough for low-end machines.Customization is amazingly awesome.To sum up this game is a gta v but free and with worse graphics and physics
1905	1	a	This game is like Yoyaz's house.Dark and full of wierd smells.
1907	1	a	My face hurts because the Bullymong hit it. Wait that's the other bad game! Chuckle Chuckle Chuckie Finster! 1/65
1909	1	a	This is an amazing game i love it a lot far too long did i spend enjoying the caombat. Besides the occasional sniper that can 2 shot or 1 shot you most guns are balanced. sadly a lot of the guns are pay to win but im saying you still cant outplay them or beat them
1911	1	a	Best free-to-play there is ATM
1913	1	a	this game. it is great with some minor flaws the biggest flaw being that it is very brutal on new players if you havent played 100-200 hours do not expect to be any good what so ever. other than that the game is great runs well on a mid price pc, and has fair fight active most of the time. if you get this game just give it time keep playing and chat with people the community is quite nice and they do not mind helping people out! overall if you like a good shooter that is similar to GTA then try it out its wurff! :) 
1915	1	a	APB is a game that has a big learning curve because it doesn't tell you what you are supposed to be doing at any given point. That said it is a game that I keep coming back to because I enjoy the movement and shooting mechanics, as well as the open world and seamless missions, and driving cars. This is not GTA: There are not a million cars. This game is about teamwork, shooting, running and parkour. It got these elements down, moreso than GTA. I think you can play this game without paying and have fun, however there are SOME advantages to buying equipment, I guess it's mostly aesthetic.  I wish other games would pull off what this game has done well, but they haven't yet. The movement, and physics are pretty good, much better than GTA5 garbage combat mechanics. Customization is unmatched ANYWHERE.  I love this game in spite of it's flaws. And I want a CAP40 sooooo bad!!
1917	1	a	Action packed and thrilling! This game will keep you on your toes.
1919	1	a	analogous to a drug
1921	1	a	Fun game, although all servers are ghost towns. Nobody plays the game anymore which is sad.
1923	1	a	Well seeing as how this game's complicated to a fault, ONLY has an awkward 'over the shoulder' camera view that I can't stand, the freeroam is day or night always full of spawn campers &amp; high level cops who either kill you or bust you every 5 secs... (WHY? because the X-box 360 won't map to the stick for stuff like turn left or right in driving mode in your car, amoung other control mapping issues on foot ect. it's not even entirely clear about if the zones [beside the social 1 where nobody shoots you &amp; you can edit your char ect.] are or are not PVP on all the time, who wants to die 10,000 times while struggling to grind a brand new char in areasd full of level capped toons with an inferiority complex... crimecraft was more fun then this @ lower levels. do_Ob
1925	1	a	hOW DO I GET IT TO START?!?!?
1927	1	a	        YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Bro Team Pill: APB&nbsp;
1929	1	a	THIS GAME IS MY LIFE :c
1931	1	a	I recommend playing it but I cant get it to load.
1933	1	a	Fun A lot of drama though.
1935	1	a	THIS GAME IS MY LIFE :c
1937	1	a	my playtime consists entirely of updating
1939	1	a	i recommend this game. its like a free gta..
1941	1	a	Great game with some awesome Customizing, only thing i hate about this game is that the weapons you buy are only 7 Days, unless you buy 'em with real money. 
1943	1	a	After 9 months without my pc, when I finally got my pc back I started with this game and I realized it that I still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing love this game!!!! I have faith in you G1 please keep the game alive somehow :D
1945	1	a	Recommended, ONLY if you got good to Great Internet speed and Good to Great amount of RAM.
1947	1	a	i love this game too bad my laptop is too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and cant play it smoothly 7/10
1949	1	a	It's like eating â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and drinking diarrhea at the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time. Basically it's just bad
1951	1	a	The game is quite good if you have someone to play it with the vehicles are fun to drive gameplay is alright and the customization is awesome
1953	1	a	GTA Online, basically.  Get this game. Mostly due to the fact that it's free to play, but also because its a solid game.

1955	1	a	Best Garbage truck simulator out there
1957	1	a	Take me down, to the San Paro city, where the noobz are green and teh hacks are pretty.
1959	1	a	I would recommend this game because it is not Pay2Win. This game actually requires very much skills and knowledge ;) When you have played like 40 hours you should know enought to be good at this game. The ingame community is suprisingly funny but sometimes rude. It is my favorite game because I never laughed my â™¥â™¥â™¥ off that much with my friends ;) 
1961	1	a	Really fun game Could improve the fps drops and stuttering 
1963	1	a	TLDR: There's only one or two real 'issues' with this game, and other than that it's pretty fun.  Before you play, just know that you will think this is GTA, you will pretend it's GTA, and once you actually get through about 20 levels worth of missions, you will realize how mistaken you were.  All points Bulletin: Reloaded (though I've never heard of the first APB unless my serial killer of an uncle is involved, shout out to you greg!) Is an 'action' shooter, semi RPG, MMO, racing, blah blah. It has little bits of everything except sci fi in it unless you consider the main item mall area where the weirdest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s I've ever seen in my life casually parade themselves through the courtyard in a display of... just... I've never such creativity in a clothing editor since the sims 3, But anywho.  The game isn't bad, the community is decent though it'd literally kill them to add in a real 'Guild' system instead of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ attempt of a gang or police possie they've tried to immulate. But I digress! Here's the main gyst of the game for you all who are bothering to read past the terrible jokes.  The game takes place in New York, scratch that, Los Angeles, it could also be Chicago. So the game takes place in [insert crime filled city with people who give no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s here] where you, either a startup policeman, or a just beginning gangster are fighting for the city. The game is not a sandbox like I was hoping, I was expecting to get my first gun, walk outside, and immediately be blown to swiss cheese by anybody from any side, fortunately they have a smart side of the system that takes out SOME of the fun, but not all of it.   You pick your side, you get your first mission and off you go to learn the ropes. Of course being the upstanding citizen I am, I had to pick being a gangster am I right? Because 'If the police won't clean up the streets, we will!' and all that jazz. After the tutorial missons finish you have a small wad of cash, and the game throws you to the wolves after that allowing you as a gangster to either steal and sell cars, rob jewelry or electronics stores by ramming your car into the window conveniently, or by doing missions. Or you can be a cop and pray that you're in the vicinity of someone breaking the law, obviously you can see the perks of each side. That is a joke, there's only one side you should be playing at this point, and it involves the scantilly clad punk asses of the gangster side, why else would you be playing the game if there's no 'breasts' in them (thank you Steam for free speech and blocking out words for female chest pieces)  As you continue through the game you buy new weapons as your loadout for missions. Here's where the cross rival faction actually has some sort of real role in the game now. While on a mission, if it lasts longer than 1-2 minutes and you're struggling to pass a certain point, cops can be sent to terminate you on your mission. No no, not permanently, however the game's been out so long and missions repeat so often that you'll either be paired against A. A player who has no idea he's even after you. B. A player who obviously doesn't care and is just waiting for someone else to break the law to steal stolen money (just play a criminal you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.) or C. A cop who has done nothing but bust people since day 1, knows every glitched spot to stop you from being able to complete you mission at all, and is able to 720 no scope you with a rocket from 300m out with a flick of his wrist, all while stroking his... ego. You get the gyst.   Like any other game, this game involves some sort of skill with shooters, or you just have to get that handy rapid fire shotgun and some body armor and not give any further â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s in the game. It's simple though, criminals get money, cops get money somewhat, both side saves up for better weapons and cars and armor until they can 720 no scope with rockets all day and not care.   In the end, the game has maybe a 6/10, I've like a lot of hours into this game but most of it was spent customizing my gangs clothing.  All in all, the character editor is 10/10, absolutely gorgeous, nothing bad to say about that, even at lowest detail. The mechanics for the game such as DRIVING I'll give it a 4/dipstick because whoever though it was a good idea to have your driving controls on the serverside instead of the clientside needs to be beaten with 2 bricks, 1 that is perfect in every way labelled 'Serverside' and one that's got some rough edges named 'Clientside'. Just uncontrollably flail the Servisde brick around his face for a bit until it eventually makes contact, and for Clientside, just give him a good whack as soon as he reads the name. Maybe he'll think twice about pressing W to go forward and waiting a full second before controls decide they'd like to move the car.  Cars still look sexy though. 6/10, would drive car like a snake again for some laughs and stop and stare at female avatars that make even straight women drool.
1965	1	a	THIS GAME IS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CANCER CONNECTING TO SERVER AND NEVER WORKS AFTER I SPENT 7500 HOURS ON IT AND PAID ALL MY SHEKELS AND IT'S NOT EVEN GIVING ME LOVE BACK.  but damn this game got cool backpacks.
1967	1	a	okay, so, i dont have many hours but i will say this, it is a hit or miss game with the public so here is a list of pros and cons as of 2/23/2016 pros: the community is alot better now that bans have been handed down over waves and such, the graphics are great for a free to play and game play is simple to learn but hard to master considerably less hackers, still out there, but i see at least five banned every day by this new system 'fair fight' awsome custom jobs and such, and amazing artwork in and out of game, and awsome player made clothing and charectars to boot, (yes, even enforcers love the way some crims stylise  now that the pros are over, he are some cons  1. hackers, still, not as much, but still there 2. PAY TO WIN, gamers first prides themselves on allowing people to have a amazing fun time, even when your loosing, but 'why is this a con?' i hear you ask? because gamers first, like any other company, like jagex and blizzard, loooooooooooooooooooooooooove money, gamers first is just a bit more open about it, they cater to the rich with awsome cars and weapons, that to have them permantly, you have to pay around 20-30$ usd to buy, and in this game, they almost force you to buy them with irl cash, which brings me onto number 3. 3. expiring weapons, after 7-10 days, your weapon you bought from your contacts is unusable, no reason why, just it, if you ever wanna have a good perm gun, your gonna need to fork over some cash. 4. community moderation, No, i dont mean 'oh admin where are you, this guy is hacking' moderation, i mean fourm moderation, gamers first doesnt really have that great of a customer service really, just a few copy and pasted anwsers most of the time, but hell, most game comapny's do this,  so, in the end, my rating would be. 7/10
1969	1	a	I Recommend this game to others because it is a fun faction game where you get to have more freedom to how you customize your cars and character than you do in GTA, and as in the name of the game, All Points Bulletin, ranking is eveything and allows you to unlock new cars, clothes, emotes, and weapons.

1973	1	a	apb is not pay2win, you are just bad
1975	1	a	I can only recommend this game for the patient, creative, and those who like oddities. APB, despite it being considered a knock off many crime based sandbox games, is unlike anything I've ever encountered previously. That doesn't mean however, is it by any means a diamond in a rough. More like the rough in a diamond. Lemme explain.  First of all, G1 is total garbage. They're only goal to milk this game as long as they can before it's lifeforce runs dry. And that's fine I suppose, people gotta make a living somehow. However, this leads to hackers running loose and the only updates coming out for it are all cosmetic items. This game seriously needs a new publisher.  That being said, those players who remain and tough it out through the steaming piles of crap are rewarded with some of the most detailed character customization I've ever seen, fun and rewarding combat, and a great community. I swear, the generally friendly and helpful community is what keeps this game alive. Everyone I've met thus far has been funny, appreciative, and forgiving to new players. Everyone who lacked patience basically quit, so now is the time to join. If you can tolerate G1's garbage. 7/10 for community alone.
1977	1	a	THIS GAME IS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CANCER CONNECTING TO SERVER AND NEVER WORKS AFTER I SPENT 7500 HOURS ON IT AND PAID ALL MY SHEKELS AND IT'S NOT EVEN GIVING ME LOVE BACK.  but damn this game got cool backpacks.
1979	1	a	I Seriously Don't Understand Why People Hate This Game. I See This Game Is Really Good! I Spent So Much Hours On This Game Its So Much Entertainment. I Highly Recommend Downloading It. But There Is Only One Problem. its The Hackers [Speed Hackers,Wall Hackers,Cracked Visa Hackers] - For People Who Hate This Game Cause Most Of The Permanent Weapons Costs Some Cash. Gotta Deal With Life Bros. - -Recommendations Add A Swear Censoring System - At The End All I Wanna Say Is No Offense To Anybody Who Doesn't Like The Game And Have A Nice Day! 
1981	1	a	  Nice game
1983	1	a	if u play this game you have a fat forhead
1985	1	a	this game sucks more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ than a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ muscle  https://youtu.be/N6XKxTUU1O0?t=639

The End
1989	1	a	Can point a rocket launcher at my feet, shoot it, not die, and kill the idiot charging me from around the corner  It's an okay game  Lemon/6.2
1991	1	a	Yes, i still love this game... even tough i am bored of it, for a few reasons, well first i'm really tired of the same aspect of the game beign, just getting called to a mission and do the objective, and or shoot enf/crims it's fun for a few hours, but noticing that im not the only one noticing that this game get really repatitive, and has pay2win weapons and other such of quipment, other then that, unlocking things is cool, but i wish i could unlock some of the lastest things, and all the new things like clothing items, and much more.... I my self, and are one of the most people that play this game, morally for the cuztomization purpose. Pretty FUN game, if you are new, also can be funner, if you accually play with a friend.
1993	1	a	i played this on and off till 2010. many ppl are getting frustrated so i try to make this quick for completly new players.   is it p2w?  only if you compare 1on1 situations. but it is NOT in a mixed team. that said, the game is frustrating at first and has a steep learing curve, you will start enjoying it after 150h or so. befor that, its a pain. i still play this with the starter weapon, because its the most versatile gun with a random team of people.  the game is heavily build around range, so your gun is only effective in certain scenarios. sub-machine guns/shotguns for close encounters, assault rifles for mid-range, snipers for longrange and machine guns against hard targets (cars). there are alot of niche roles but don't bother with them at first.  your starting weapon is a  mid-range  assault rifle (STAR 556). the gun is basically good in most situations but won't exceed in any. if you keep that in mind and don't let the enemy lure you into situations where your weapon is inferior (basically situations where you try to kill a sniper at high range or outperform a shotgun in close quarter), the odds are mostly even and only movement and skill will decide the outcome.  thats about it. 2 veteran players can easly outmaneuver and destroy a whole group of players with payed weapons with just positioning and granate throwing skills... sure there are alot of veteran players out there with payed guns and a ton of hours gameplay which are deadly in most encounters but it's not the payed guns, its mainly good gameplay.  the game is also very 'ragey' and full of trolls. don't know about the hackers too... also since g1 took this game over i think the server-performance is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, type '/fps' ingame to see your performance, if your fps spike to often in battle, just don't play it. you will lose because of bad latency and its frustrating.  overall i can recommend it, its free, great tactical gameplay. its mostly skill based with a very harsh learning curve.
1995	1	a	This game might not be perfect, and it might be plagued with issues such as optimization, server performance, hack prevention, terrible matchmaking system (one that relies on a faulty threat level system), and more...  But, it's a game that is unlike any other, and one that has a lot of potential. The customization offered in APB: Reloaded is unrivaled: allowing you to customize your clothing, appearence, car, music, and graffiti as much as you want (within defined symbol limits; premium members [A 10$ish fee] get more layers to use).  I've played this since before it was APB:R. It's been about three long years (or, technically, like two years and like three months). It remains to be seen if APB:R will last. Management has not been kind to the game in the last two years, despite their attempts. The newest management claims to be more dedicated to fixing the game... that remains to be seen. There's a lot that needs to be done.  But if this game does get its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together (and I really, really hope it does), it could easily become popular again.   It's just got a long way to go.    Still: Give it a shot. At the very least for the customization. The game will seem bad from the get-go (the learning curve is steep and the community is awful), but try to stick around.
1997	1	a	Take me down, to the San Paro city, where the noobz are green and teh hacks are pretty.
1999	1	a	Awesome game but if they could make the requirstemt little lower for lower pc or laptops.
2001	1	a	This game is unique and insane! So goooooooood!  Pay to win? More or less, this game is free, but this is more about skills than money, all reviews talking about 'p2w' is from crying babies.  I spent a lot of money in this game already, I have good weapons, good stuffs but a player without cash but knows how to play, can beat anyone easy.
2003	1	a	Its ok
2005	1	a	Great Free To Play! All I Gotta Say Cause Nothing Wrong With It, Runs Smooth and Plays Smooth, And Reminds Me Of GTA BUT! FREE! Who Can Go Wrong With It?
2007	1	a	IT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SUCKS I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING HATE IT ITS SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING LAGGY AND THERE ARE SO MANY HACKERS AND THEY JUST KEEP KILLING ME EVERYTIME I WALK OUT OF A SAFEHOUSE
2009	1	a	dont know but when i download it, it says its done but ALWAYS stops installing at 5-20 seconds left
2011	1	a	it sucks
2013	1	a	this is a good game 
2015	1	a	i have played this game like for a 1000 hours and still loving this game so i invite you to play it...
2017	1	a	This game is incredibly frustrating. But play it, because at the same time, It's one of the best F2P Shooters I've found.
2019	1	a	this is in a way a online grand theft game... but i like it more you get to drive cars/kill people steal and other fun â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. in a way its pay to win but you can win with out ingame â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ :P
2021	1	a	Awesome Game!!!!! It's Reall Fun To Be A Criminal Too In The Game :D
2023	1	a	Good: It's a good game with a big map. You can play with you freinds and spend a holy day of you life on this game!  Could be better: I think the should remove Auto-ready.  Stars: 4,5 out of 5   :D good game   Signed DanishAllstarsGaming 
2025	1	a	This game is cool guys
2027	1	a	A truly unique gaming experience, almost endless character and gear customization, fast-paced FPS action, and the timelessness of cops vs robbers.
2029	1	a	Lots of fun!!!
2031	1	a	+ Fun game. - Idiotic community. - Pay 2 Win. 
2033	1	a	Practically GTA Online without the GTA
2035	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Please I'M FABULOUS
2037	1	a	Love this game!
2039	1	a	Fun to play with friends
2041	1	a	Jumped off a building and went through the ground and got banned for 'Exploiting'. 9000/9001
2043	1	a	Great F2P
2045	1	a	Its a awesome game :D I recomande it and you should play it bicause i have a cool name ;)
2047	1	a	Please make this for mac!!
2049	1	a	All Point Bulletins...  When this game came out and the servers opened, the game itself was annoying beyond limit : only two servers that were overpopulated almost all the time, letting you discover the joy of something called 'Lag' in 2010, but also an awful stability regarding which system you were running. If you had Windows XP SP3, everything was -relatively- fine ; if you had Windows Vista... well, you were already â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed.  One year later, the game becomes Free-To-Play and is even available on Steam in some so-called 'Reloaded' version. After sixteen attempts at keeping the damn software running for more than ten minutes, I gave up : it still full of random memory troubles, especially if you run it with Windows Seven, two Nvidia Quadro 4000, a processor Intel i7 Extreme Edition and 10Gb of Crucial Ballistix RAM.  Like if it wasn't already bad, the game requires PunkBuster, the worst counter bot ever created on Earth. Moreover, the customisation part is ridiculously limited.
2051	1	a	Only good part is importing music  I played for like 5 hours and 2 hours in im bored to tears so i just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed around ramming cars then i decided to blocked the garage and spam porn music 10/10 IGN 
2053	1	a	really good game but you need really good wifi to make it work top noch id give the game 97-100
2055	1	a	I thought the graphics were going to be better, Kind of a dissapoint ment. 9/10 would bone again
2057	1	a	its fun to play and its good but there is hackers.
2059	1	a	it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2061	1	a	Buggy as hell but an amazing game
2063	1	a	Great game overall, excellent graphics and animations. The customization alone has no equal in the MMO gaming world as far as I'm aware. Combine that with a broad selection of weapons, upgrades, skills and other features and you got yourself a top notch game. Its even free to play, what more could you ask for? Well for one its pay to win and if you're not paying they're constantly showing you how much you're missing out on for not giving them money. Do or don't its up to you as it doesn't really add much to the game.  TL;DR  Pros -Good Graphics -Good Character design -Good combat -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good everything   Cons -They really really want your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money -Like really want it -Want it so bad that the guy who gave them 20 dollars has a gun that kills you in two shots bad -like srs   If you can get past that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ then the game is really fun, overall I recommend it.
2065	1	a	its nice.. I'd recommend people to try it considering its free also.
2067	1	a	Great game would recoment to anybody wanting action
2069	1	a	The game was fun and addicting for a bit. Games were pretty competitive except matchmaking wasn't too fair.
2071	1	a	this game is sooooo fun
2073	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2075	1	a	I do this stuff in real life on the norm. Word to yo motha
2077	1	a	My only advice to the people who wants to play this game is dont play it alone because when you are alone its really boring and lots of trolls will destroy your game experience.
2079	1	a	The lag on this game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke, it actually just makes you angry when you play because the server is so crap it can't handle the game itself. you get good days and bad but really, Don't drop a single cent into this game as I made the mistake of doing, you'll get owned by aimbotters who don't care if they get banned because they just create new free accounts and start all over again. I just played a game now after some time and wow, the lag made me want to throw my laptop into a wall.
2081	1	a	Brick killed a guy.  10/10
2083	1	a	Love it so fun but aim is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2085	1	a	Not bad, Needs to Update the Graphics settings.
2087	1	a	Great multiplayer shooter with ok ghraphics so you wont need a great computer to play. Though it is a VERY VERY glitchy game evreytime i hijack a car then go out to shoot the person they dissapear and not only that when i go to hijack a car then i see a better one i stop person dissapeared again! PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME. Would higly recomend  4.3/5
2089	1	a	geat game almost flawless reminds me of grand theft auto
2091	1	a	Haven't even been able to start the garbo thing without screen flickering or facebook adverts. 11/10 best game ever once it's uninstalled.
2093	1	a	10/10 I don't even know what I'm doing
2095	1	a	If you feel like playing GTA but you don't have enough to buy the game, this game is a good substitute for it. APB is awesome. You can design your character like a badass muddapucker. You can get awesome guns and cars. You can race, play missions with your friends and kill pedestrian like a boss. The game is hard in the beginning because of some A-hole in the game who has better guns and cars than you. But don't be discourage, you'll get there. Trade items with your friends like an awesome car. Everyone should play this game, it's awesome.
2097	1	a	Pretty fun game to pass the time with, but need to play with friends, not a solo game :D
2099	1	a	Best point and click adventure game ever 10/10
2101	1	a	Eh. It's ok I guess.
2103	1	a	APB is a very fun to play game, you don't need to pay for anything to have loads of fun. Some features of the game include Cops and Robbers, Ram Raiding (by far the best), and freeroam. There is DLC to buy but i don't use it mainly because i don't want to buy it. This is my opinion of the game, and i hope you like it. Enjoy those RamRaids!!!
2105	1	a	You all have got to try out this game if you haven't yet. It is Awesome!
2107	1	a	I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to feel like they should be winning but still be losing anyway.
2109	1	a	
2111	1	a	This game is awesome there is alot of things to do more than gta
2113	1	a	Very fun
2115	1	a	Nice game! if you like to edit your own character, This game is for you
2117	1	a	It is so so.
2119	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with APB Reloaded. The pros are that it's a ton of fun to play. The cons are that it's really hard to get the hang of, and it's very buggy and crashy. Your screen loading times are also going to suck. But if you can get past all that, it's not bad for a Free To Play online GTA.
2121	1	a	Very nice Graphic and background i like game but need uptade case add ant weapon to sell steam Market
2123	1	a	:) 
2125	1	a	really great game try it out
2127	1	a	APB has to be of the biggest love-hate relationship games I have ever played.   First of all I can say after all the time I've played, this game is not meant for the hardcore gamers because rage will be induced within 35 seconds of starting a mission. The guns are overall balanced (to a point) but almost everytime a new reskin of a gun comes out it is exremely overpowering. The community is...... rough around the edges but mostly fun to play with and against. Customization in the game is fun aswell if you have a creative side. A lot of people can say it's bad and horrible but from my eyes it is still a fun game if you don't take it too serious. Just have fun and don't let the trollish players try to act better than you.   
2129	1	a	A free gta basically
2131	1	a	this game sux. Go play tf2
2133	1	a	I love this game but i wish it wasnt so hard on my pc 
2135	1	a	Have Fun Killing and stealing on game 'I recommend This Game.'
2137	1	a	This game could have been amazing, its got all the elements. Only problem is there weren't any significant updates after the game changed companies. It has it's share of problems such as cheaters, slight buy to win edge, lots of ram needed to play. However for its price (free) its an excellent game to kill time and the gameplay itself is great, best online 3rd person shooter ever. Also so much customization, cars, characters, clothes, music. Maybe one day a worthy company will pick this one up and improve upon the concept. Until then I'll kill enforcers. Over and over.
2139	1	a	This game is cool guys
2141	1	a	A truly unique gaming experience, almost endless character and gear customization, fast-paced FPS action, and the timelessness of cops vs robbers.
2143	1	a	Lots of fun!!!
2145	1	a	Realy good game to spend your time and money on.   Pay2Win..
2147	1	a	Good game, terrible company. By the time you read this the servers will prolly be dead.
2149	1	a	dis a good â™¥â™¥â™¥ game add me  gold threat jericho crim - SociallyUnstable - r217 enf - n0fl0ck - r70~ something
2151	1	a	Like smashing your friends van to steal a boombox? GET ABP RELOADED! Like getting your van stolen by your friend? GET ABP RELOADED! Wanna die? Commit suicide, or GET ABP RELOADED! Like copyrighted cars? GET ABP RELOADED!    Best game ever 666/10
2153	1	a	BLUF: Kinda like GTA, if you like that you might like APB, and this is free!  Dislikes: Controls (Having a hard time using a controller, and some keybinds weren't working) Repetition (Every game has it, but it tends to feel quite the same after a day or so) No others at this time, sorry to disappoint!  Likes: Customization (You can customize your character, car and weapons. Many different looks!) Server Ranks (You get ranked based off your ability to play, but it's a little broke as you can drop rank easy) Free to Play (The F2P model isn't bad, and the premium value is worth it for an avid player)
2155	1	a	Nice game... 
2157	1	a	This game is Heaven for all PvP'ers and MMO players
2159	1	a	yes get this ish.....if your low-res likeing dumbass...this game really sucks
2161	1	a	Ive been with this game before it came out on steam and when i first came out the amount of progress that have got into this game is amazing im still playing this game and i wont stop playing until all servers are shutdown or n new stuff comes out but yes i recommend this game  Pros and cons Cons: The game is really hard to play and you need to have Voce communication Its recommend for this game and that you also need to put time into this game when you start out You will die alot but over time you will become good at this game  Pros: The Customizeing in this game is out standing you can go into so much detail into this game its unbeliveable also with the graphics are old but they still look good the Car driving is also amazing ome cars are really hard to controll but you can get used to it easyliy You can play with Freinds also You will be able to roam any where in the world and you will be able to join in events to earn quick and fun rewards after completeing the event   Now theres a couple of bugs with in this game like sometimes seeing green background or the audio is Cracking up or you will see the servers are down but theres 30 people in the server the server is still up you can still join just saying   I HOPE THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL HAVE FUN PLAYING :)
2163	1	a	Now, I bought this game back in 2009. Yes, bought. $50, spent another $10 for 30 days of action district time. I had managed to obtain 6 months worth of action district time by selling Portal themed vehicles in the marketplace for subscription currency (it wasn't illegal, they had actually made a system for it). When this game was revived by GamersFirst, all of us who bought this game retail only got our original characters back as compensation. But... all of our character stats had been wiped. Why am I telling you this? So you'll be surprised to say that, despite being screwed over, this game is still addictive and fun enough to still jump back in and play from square one. Its an exceptionally fun game if you play with a good group of friends or a clan and use voice communication as well. Tactical team gameplay is a must for this game. If you have a coordinated team of players who use excellent gameplay tactics, you will hardly ever lose. A recommended download.
2165	1	a	this is a good game becuase it has a uninstall botton
2167	1	a	Amazing game with great development. Only issues are many hackers and a very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mathcmaking setup 
2169	1	a	could not make an accout 11/12
2171	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2173	1	a	I think they should implement motorcycles.  - God Bless
2175	1	a	Okey heres the deal, this game is a hackers sandbox....with potential. All the old players understand that this game is good, it can be played for free even if its not ideal, and the customisation is what realy sets this game apart, but them hackers tho  Honestly when this game has cleared that problem up then this game will be great again, for any old player has played those matches without hacks were genuine skill were what counted and enjoyed them
2177	1	a	I played this when it was in beta even though my in game hours don't show it. I can recomend this game to others.  Pros: Easy reward system for quests. Easy to fallow Quest system. Cars with atributes that are resonable( maybe not some will come with a big price tag on them), and some what customize-able. Striat forword Totrails when offered. Unlock ranks for some guns/ cars.  Cons: Like any other game that is free there is a paiying side, is the paying side rewarded more, yes and loads I haven't played in a while and can't tell but, some times on either(cops or criminals) side there would be an extremly high level high ranking player sitting on the edge of town with a sniper shooting into spawn, halours events fallowed. Car controls last I played were jarring and unstable unsre if it was becuase of type of car. (Yes that matters alot in ths game).  I cann not say much about the rest of the fetures of the game becasue I acullty haven't exploered all that much. I may change my review later for a better desription and general knowladge.
2179	1	a	This game can get you raged as all hell, and yet once your hooked you'll keep coming back..  If you find the good side of the community, make a few friends, and get built up a little bit you'll love it.
2181	1	a	The biggest most funnest online open world multiplayer out there!
2183	1	a	It`s a good game when you play ,why,it`s very simple i know it lag a little bit but , it gives you personage customesation it`s multyplayer , have good graphics good bullet effect ... etc and i like it
2185	1	a	the game itself is great and one request from this low-spec and low internet data budget person  -please make server on singapore or filipine or indonesia , so i (or even we) can play with small and more stable ping and make the game fun to all  even though that is the only trouble i have on this game , i still recommend this game to you guys   
2187	1	a	Tons of fun, once you get past the learning curve and actually understand the game its awesome. Recommended to play with friends.
2189	1	a	Great game 100000000000000/10 /spoiler  
2191	1	a	Its pretty much a free version of GTA V if your too poor to afford GTA V  My first day.. Walk out of the Station...see three pimped out Super cars drag racing down the street...one hits a car, flips over, and exploads... Me: I think I'm gona like this game!  Second Day... Walk out of the Station...See a pimped out van driving down the streets with 2 guys hanging out the sides unloading their weapons into whoever is chaseing them...Whos chasing them? two pimped out Super cars with sirens blaring...one hit a car, flips over and explodes... Me: Yep...I'm definitly gona like this game...
2193	1	a	it's a game that exists, isn't that good enough?                                    really you'd only play this for the customization, but that's besides the point
2195	1	a	Amazingly Addicting! A bit repetative though.
2197	1	a	Pretty good game idk why u guys are so mean like yea it crashes it makes you play more, i dont feel like it makes me play forever im not so good at designs but i like it!!! 9/10
2199	1	a	Grab ur friends and play as criminals or enforcers.
2201	1	a	Note: I actually have around 40 hours into this game, I'm not a huge noob.  This is not your normal MMO, it plays like a triple A crime game. The game takes place in a crime torn city called San Paro. The crime has gotten so bad that the mayor is giving out conceal and carry permits and letting vigilantes take justice into their own hands. So, that's where your character comes in. You start and pick a gender and customize your character. The customization options are nearly endless, and you can alter nearly every fine detail of your character. You pick to be either an Enforcer, which are the vigilantes, or a Criminal, which is pretty self explanatory. There are two main 'districts' where you can complete missions for crime bosses or respected vigilantes to increase your standing with them. These are big open worlds where you can do anything you want, whether that's doing missions, racing around, jumping your car off things, shooting stuff, well, you know, it's like GTA Online with MMO elements, which makes for an exciting game. The cars have nice variation to them, trucks have more power and less speed, cars are fairly fast and pretty weak, and then there are sport cars which are very fast and pretty weak, unless you equip them with extra armor. This game has many complaints about being pay to win, but I don't find it that way at all. I haven't put a penny in it, and feels pretty fair and balanced to me. The guns have some good variation to them too, which fit basically all playstyles. The mssions are team based, and are mainly the bad guys doing bad stuff, and the good guys getting sent out to stop them. It can actually be pretty fun though. The criminals can aslo commit crimes to make money, and Enforcers can catch criminals to make some extra cash. The community is ok, except for your occasional truck griefers, which you'll find out what they are most likely in your game time. So now, let's break it down.  Pros: Great Graphics Fun gameplay Good Variation Wide range of vehicles Nearly everything is customizable It's free You can do basically anything you want  Cons: Occasional lag Community can suck at times Textures don't always load in instantly Can feel repetitive if you're grinding to level up  I rate this game a 9/10
2203	1	a	The game just stoped working for some reason .. Something about an error but ive done the updates and everthing?....But other than that its a good game 
2205	1	a	this game is bay 2 win fun 
2207	1	a	is good i met 2pac he wasnt very nice tho
2209	1	a	Pretty fun game to pass the time with, but need to play with friends, not a solo game :D
2211	1	a	Best point and click adventure game ever 10/10
2213	1	a	Eh. It's ok I guess.
2215	1	a	Long download time.
2217	1	a	APB is a very fun to play game, you don't need to pay for anything to have loads of fun. Some features of the game include Cops and Robbers, Ram Raiding (by far the best), and freeroam. There is DLC to buy but i don't use it mainly because i don't want to buy it. This is my opinion of the game, and i hope you like it. Enjoy those RamRaids!!!
2219	1	a	very good....to a point....but the good is way more then the bad
2221	1	a	Hackers, Aimbots, Scum of the earth...  That's the APB you know and love. No matter how many times this game kicks you when you're down, you'll always come crawling back!
2223	1	a	Server is kinda shaky here and there but overall its a good game! *Important get a INTEL processor to run this game stresses a lot  on Processing power. Edit: 11/4/15 : Server performance is great getting 1ms latency.
2225	1	a	one of the greates GTA online out There
2227	1	a	This game is amazing. I made an african american character and put chicken legs and racial slurs all over my car. Great game overall.
2229	1	a	It kills you from the inside
2231	1	a	The launcher crashes before it even begins. 9/11 Would relaunch again.
2233	1	a	This game makes me think a bit of an online GTA, but in it's own way. Things like chasing the bad guys or rob stores gives the game a fun twist.  It has been a while since I played the game, but I really had a problem with the game performance (even with a decent gaming setup). I hope this got fixed in the last year.
2235	1	a	Like GTA, customizing,Cars,ETC this Game is for you It's like GTA But better Get this game it's free!
2237	1	a	im in love. 20/10 would run over, mug, murder innocent civilians again!
2239	1	a	I love this game, It's addicting and fun, and I met alot of awesome people because of it.
2241	1	a	  The game is a lot of fun. Yes the objectives are pretty much repeatable, but every time you play the same objective its different expirience, because of the people you play with and against are different. The only thing i hate about this game is the loading time, but it still worth waiting.
2243	1	a	Can't even register an account.   Best uninstaller simulator, 11/10 Would uninstall again!
2245	1	a	hours of fun customizing cars and outfits aswell as lots of fun killing and driving through the streets running over pedrestrians
2247	1	a	Fantastic. It is basically GTA online but not GTA? Then get this!
2249	1	a	If you don't mind grinding and playing against P2W â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ It's gud game
2251	1	a	Feels Good, Uninstalling. P2W
2253	1	a	Best game you could play.
2255	1	a	I didn't play much of it, it's okay I guess
2257	1	a	I made nazi uniforms for myself and friends, I then discoverd nazi iconography is now banned in the game. My friends and I pondered why this was so while standing on top of a burned-out car seeing who could shoot civilians at the greatest distance with the stock handgun.  I then saw a poster depicting one of the 'My Little Ponies' getting sodomized by a man, which is apparently ok to show in-game.  
2259	1	a	i need an understanding of this game.. i just dont get it , but its addicting ,i have fun and frustraion while playing it for hours at a time..
2261	1	a	this is intsalled but i have yet to play it...
2263	1	a	This game is not for filthy casuals. It needs a good amont of time to 'git rly gud' at it.
2265	1	a	10/10 would burn wallet again.
2267	1	a	After 1 flip car blown up 10/10 would flip it again
2269	1	a	I definatly 100% recommend this game as its a fun free roam car and shooter game. It's soo good ive scored over 500HRS on it!
2271	1	a	I think its a little bit like arma 3 altis life... Just my thaughts of the game...
2273	1	a	Yes its a great game. If u dont have enought $ for gta 5 get this. Nt the same game that much but very similar!
2275	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2277	1	a	This is ta best game ever ! i love him &lt;3
2279	1	a	I think that APB Reloaded is a good game and i think you should get it and make an account.
2281	1	a	If you're looking for fun, I guess this is a good substitute.
2283	1	a	Good If You Can Run It Sad That I cant my CPU is to low thats all it is why i cant run it
2285	1	a	Absolute awful excuse for a game. Huge disadvantage set against beginners as max rank players are still able to play against them. AI is simply dreadful and driving any car is a monumental task. 0/10 would deffo not play again
2287	1	a	Nice game, but the game would be more nice if you could throw grenades while in car. 9/10.
2289	1	a	Extremely underrated game!  Pros: Extreme customisation system Gameplay simmilar to that of Grand Theft Auto V Good enough graphics  Cons: MICROTRANSACTIONS.
2291	1	a	You can become a gang member in this game.
2293	1	a	I Love the game becuse it is like cops and robs 
2295	1	a	10/10 would reload again.
2297	1	a	It has something the recent Saints Row have, but infact this game is alot better.   Gets out car, car goes kamikaze and kills me, would kamikaze again. 10/10
2299	1	a	Great game
2301	1	a	Good: It's a good game with a big map. You can play with you freinds and spend a holy day of you life on this game!  Could be better: I think the should remove Auto-ready.  Stars: 4,5 out of 5   :D good game   Signed DanishAllstarsGaming 
2303	1	a	selling rare pepes please hit up my profile
2305	1	a	Downloaded game, entered the city, got into a mission, I rekt a guy, guy accused me of hacker.   10/10 would Rekt him again.
2307	1	a	Do you want aids? How about cancer? If so, download this game IMMEDIATELY! Kids will hackusate you all day, and will rage at you for doing something you are supposed to! This game has all in all made me love every gaming community so much more, just because the community in APB sucks so much! Thanks, APB!
2309	1	a	Great game.
2311	1	a	P2W Buy lmg from there store to win
2313	1	a	This game is cool =) I spend 400e for G1C and destroyed 4 keyboards =)
2315	1	a	This game is so awesome in so many ways that I can't even describe, the customization system (amazing), graphics (pretty good) everything is good in this game but I would like the game to be patched because it still has some bugs so I really hope you get that fixed.
2317	1	a	The best shooter there is as long as there no hackers in the game your playing.
2319	1	a	Now before you write this off as a fanboy review, hear me out. Don't listen to the negitive reviews, this game is a ton of fun.   It plays a lot like GTA Online but in a free to play format. That sounds like a nightmare, i know, but it really isn't. It's kind of grindy, but that is to expect from a F2P game. Don't expect to have to play 100+ hours for a single item.  There is an endless amount of character and vehicle customization, this is half the fun for me. A really interesting thing they did with vehicles is how the radio works. You can import your songs and play them through the car, like the 'personal' radio channel in GTA. But wait, it gets better. Everyone in and around the vehicle can hear what you are playing, so the farther away the car is the less you can hear it. AND if you have the doors open(ie. when you are parked), the music is clear, and when the doors are closed, it's muffled. That's a very small thing to mention, but i like the attention to detail for this kind of stuff. I play this game myself and have made a few friends through this game, and it's a lot more fun if you have a friend to play with. Now, one of my favorite parts is that the chat is uncensored. It's hilarious.  Now for the bad:   The devs are almost non-existant. They're there, but updates are few and far between.  Hackers. They pretty much drove the game into the ground. The amount of people that play is low compared to any other similar game. FairFight keeps getting better, so there are a lot less hackers than there used to be.  And lastly, the textures and models are a little dated, gameplay could use some refining, and there are only 2 main maps. That being said, you are playing in a giant city so i can't complain wbout having more than one map.  If you can get past that, it's a really fun game to play, plus it's free, so it's definitely worth trying.  All 'n all, I would definitely reccomend this game.
2321	1	a	240 hours and I finally got past the loading screen!
2323	1	a	played it on my old pc and i'll play it again!
2325	1	a	It's sad how pathetic this game is.
2327	1	a	Best Online Game Ever. If you like GTA series, then you would like this game too.
2329	1	a	Absolute awful excuse for a game. Huge disadvantage set against beginners as max rank players are still able to play against them. AI is simply dreadful and driving any car is a monumental task. 0/10 would deffo not play again
2331	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me in the â™¥â™¥â™¥
2333	1	a	Hands down, my favorite MMO. Tons of action, great customization abilities, awesome gameplay. And yes, it may be rampant with hackers, but it's still tons of fun to play
2335	1	a	It's sad how pathetic this game is.
2337	1	a	A new gen GTA....well guys give it a shot!
2339	1	a	best game to play,iam addicted
2341	1	a	The best game ever made! huge customazation and alot of fun playing with other noobs :D TRY IT OUT!
2343	1	a	Recommended for Free2Play and casual play.   After pushing myself to try this game out for a couple of hours it just didn't have what it took to pull me in and keep me entertained. This style of MMO can be fun but it is very obvious that APB Reloaded is a 'take and hold' type of game with a p2w factor included.   I do appreciate a game of this quality to be free2play however and the devs did a nice job in the creation of something better than a quest to collect and bring back flowers. The quests are easier to understand after a bit of time invested but very obvious that development could be better in terms of questing.  If you are looking for a way to kill time by the same objective over and over in a GTA-limited style, then this game is for you and there is no problem with that. In my opinion, it just doesn't have that hook I look for in games.  
2345	1	a	kive the game 
2347	1	a	Its a game
2349	1	a	Was great and gives you Tourette syndrome for the time being but after a while it gets old but it's your call I'm done with it I think...
2351	1	a	i have not played it yet so ummm yupp i cant start the gaME ITL ODAS 5868586758U67586758675876857685675867568576857685768576875867586758768567576857685678576857685685768576576857685768849069548547847T346R3478768574687547676767676455453634756868994990Y6905887 SECONDS 
2353	1	a	Love it so fun but aim is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2355	1	a	This game is great playing with friends and other people, but is very boring when it comes to single player standards.  8/10.
2357	1	a	This game is not that bad. i do like it but they got some big time bugs!
2359	1	a	APB was a bad game to me at first, but then i started to play more hoping it would get better. And It did, the game (in my opinion) is not P2W i have bought single gun, and do better then most of the people i play against. So in overal, the game is really fun, besides the fact that missions are repetitive. The graphics are pretty nice, and really fun if you play with friends Via Skype. So download the game and message me if you want to play together :)
2361	1	a	vewry fun game a litlle laggy but its free 2 pay so i cant complain but overall very fun
2363	1	a	preety cool game 
2365	1	a	This game is incredibly frustrating. But play it, because at the same time, It's one of the best F2P Shooters I've found.
2367	1	a	Great multiplayer shooter with ok ghraphics so you wont need a great computer to play. Though it is a VERY VERY glitchy game evreytime i hijack a car then go out to shoot the person they dissapear and not only that when i go to hijack a car then i see a better one i stop person dissapeared again! PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME. Would higly recomend  4.3/5
2369	1	a	CANT WAIT TO PLAY OMGGGGGGGG
2371	1	a	its a game....
2373	1	a	im on both yes and no to this game.the bad thing is u need to use real cash to buy special equipment and the server lobby aint that good but still this is a good game
2375	1	a	this game siad that i cant play becuse d3dx9_43.dll
2377	1	a	Killed by half naked womens  its ok 9/10
2379	1	a	The game is pretty addictive by itself, once you get used to the intermittent lag that once in a while makes you rage. But it isn't game breaking as some other people in the reviews portray it to be. Its a fun, highly customizable game that is receiving an engine upgrade and console port somewhere in 2015. Buying stuff for real money off their marketplace is HIGHLY optional and I've never found the need for the guns, which by far are just better looking and sounding reskins of the existing in-game guns. There are also a significant number of community-wide contests held by Reloaded Productions giving away small items that almost convince you to go back every time. There are always OMFG moments though, as sometimes you could be facing highly co-ordinated teams that everyone accuses of hacking and are really not but you learn to roll with it. I have additional 1200 hours on this game besides the Steam count and have completed the progression thrice with different characters. The GMs have, in the past, promised a lot of things to be given a long time ago (read: a year). They have not delivered yet. This includes more content that isn't just a simple reskin, an engine upgrade and a new anti-hacking system. The last was implemented in Q4 2014. Simply put, this game can be very enjoyable and very annoying as well. As a new player in this game, it works to your advantage if you haven't played MMOs before allowing you to keep the tolerence to learn the game instead of rage quitting. You will die a lot and you will be abused a little by other players, but if you learn, you'll love this game...
2381	1	a	One of the best games ever!. I keep coming back to this game, it's so much fun!
2383	1	a	Pros 1. Love the Customization even for a Free Account (9.9/10) = Not cause I'm free (There is a Limit (3), The Video is showing you a Premium Account(50)), but cause I thought clothing was more modular (And trust it is already pretty modular, reminds me of NFS Carbon and the Customization is so good it can be a game on its own)    Example of What I thought Clothing Customization would be = Shirt: Collars/Cuff Type, Collar/Sleeve Length and Collar Form; a Deep V-Neck with Fur Collar, Tight Long Sleeves (Upto Wrist) and Puffy Rounded Fur Cuffs --vs-- Tight Open Turtleneck (Under the Jaw) with Button/Latch Collar (Similar to Motorcycle Bike Rider Jacket) and Sleeveless/Shoulder Length with Ripped Cuff (Similar to Ryu from Street Fighter) (For Cuff Types Google 302444931199841460 ) = Shoe's Length, sole or toe/heel type: High Feel Sneakers vs Clown Boots (Kingdom Hearts), Spiked Toes/heel vs Open Toes/heel (Naruto) = Gloves Length (Half of Palm, Wrist, Elbow, Shoulder), Finger/Knuckless (Which Finger(s)), Palm/Back hand less (Size, Shape), Wrist/Finger Trim/Cuff (Ribbed, Zipped, etc) = Holding style as well (There isn't Dual), but Shoot the weapon the way you want     2. Love the Controls as I use keyboard (8/10, but need some buttons to overlap specific controls like Turning the Camera On Foot, but not while Driving)  3. Love the GTA Feel (9/10, Commandeer or Hijack Vehicles, but sadly only 2 weapons are allow to be equipped at once and there isn't dual Wielding)  Cons 3. The thing I like the least is the Tutorial (5/10) as I will not gain money and there are no NPCs. I'm stuck trying to find the Evidence Vault -some places are hard to find- need indication of which door is usable and step by step of where to go ( Highlight the Area/Path or Place it somewhere easy to access)  4. Jumping and Climbing is in, but its predetermined (So those walls you can almost make it over, you can't), and there are so many doors to go through
2385	1	a	GTA/ Saints Row type of game. Animations should be a bit more stable, but good for i free game!
2387	1	a	This game is REALLY fun. The multiplayer is AMAZING and if you like Grand Theft Auto you'll like APB Reloaded.
2389	1	a	IVE HAD MORE FUN PETTING MY GOAT THAN PLAYING THIS GAME
2391	1	a	This game is great fun when you are just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing with people. The actual core gameplay is abysmal.  My advice is try it for yourself, make a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ looking character, and go ram people in their little ricer cars. Endless fun.
2393	1	a	The game is good yet bad at the same time. When I played it, many months ago, I enjoyed it to an extreme but there were far too many hackers, much less so with the incorporation of Fairfight.. It was a highly P2W game, and still is, but the benefits for paying can easily be countered by guns that you do not have to buy. I used a gun that I got with in-game currency and slaughtered many people that played with weapons they bought using real money. So, the pay to win aspect can be countered by those who do not buy weapons making it still, somewhat fair.  I would love to continue playing the game but I can't. The reason for this is because the company has 3 rank servers set up; bronze, silver and gold. Each of these servers are based on your skill. If you are amazing, you are thrown in the gold server which has very very few people in it, almost none, making it impossible to play. I am a gold, based on my skill, but I can't play because nobody is in the gold server. The only way you can get into the other servers is by dying a lot or joining a silver-ranked friend. I don't have any friends on that game who still play so how can I join them and how can I die if there is nobody in the gold server to play with?  All in all, I like the game but it would not be worth paying for. I recommend that anyone reading this review would try the game, as it is free, but don't put any money down on it. Many people don't recommend the game but people still play it. Check the game out for yourself before judging.
2395	1	a	It has something the recent Saints Row have, but infact this game is alot better.   Gets out car, car goes kamikaze and kills me, would kamikaze again. 10/10
2397	1	a	great game and best game for driving, talking to friends, and making chaos
2399	1	a	Good game, Good gamplay, I think this game shouldnt be free i should be 19.99
2401	1	a	great game but has its down sides like hackers an being called a hacker XD i dont know the 1st thing into hacking but on the plus side of things its free basicly like gta online but it was out before gta online altho there are gold menbers that kick â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but its a good game
2403	1	a	This game is like GTA but with endless custumization i dont recommend getting it on steam because people say its broken on steam it is fairly easy to get it on the web. i do still recocemmend trying the steam APB, mostly because the download from the browser is full of hackers
2405	1	a	Nice game! if you like to edit your own character, This game is for you
2407	1	a	It is so so.
2409	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with APB Reloaded. The pros are that it's a ton of fun to play. The cons are that it's really hard to get the hang of, and it's very buggy and crashy. Your screen loading times are also going to suck. But if you can get past all that, it's not bad for a Free To Play online GTA.
2411	1	a	Very fun
2413	1	a	Nice game! if you like to edit your own character, This game is for you
2415	1	a	It is so so.
2417	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with APB Reloaded. The pros are that it's a ton of fun to play. The cons are that it's really hard to get the hang of, and it's very buggy and crashy. Your screen loading times are also going to suck. But if you can get past all that, it's not bad for a Free To Play online GTA.
2419	1	a	didnt even get it and im execited XD
2421	1	a	Purgatory Simulator 10/10  Will still wait for engine update.    In all seriousness, I love this game, and I have put an absurd amount of money and over five hundred hours into APB:R. Hands down, one of the more unique games on the market, with plenty of oppertunites to make your character truly your own with the customization, etc...  However, I have come to find that I cannot enjoy playing a game with horrendous FPS dips and overall lag issues. As much as I have honed my skill and mastered my weapons in the middle of an intense firefight when the frame rate drops to four or less per second, that can take all the fun out of a game. I want this game to have balance between player and free from those who abuse or manipulate the game, making it drab for everyone. Lately when I log on I cannot play for very long before the urge to quit sets in.   If you can handle unpredictable frame rates and crippling latency issues, then I would definately recommend.
2423	1	a	this game is bay 2 win fun 
2425	1	a	If you dont like the game because of hackers, become a hacker.
2427	1	a	A really good game with lots of customisation options, really fun to play with friends, it gets patched alot and the devs fix alot of bugs. The only 'big' problem of this game is the server lag that can sometimes annoy you and make you rage quit, but all in all its a really fun game :)
2429	1	a	could not make an accout 11/12
2431	1	a	AWESOME JUST LIKE GTA
2433	1	a	IT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SUCKS I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING HATE IT ITS SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING LAGGY AND THERE ARE SO MANY HACKERS AND THEY JUST KEEP KILLING ME EVERYTIME I WALK OUT OF A SAFEHOUSE
2435	1	a	This game is awesome and the customization is awesome but prices in armas is real expensive its like 50 euro for 1 car and its super laggy you gut to have a real buff computer and awesome internet connection to handle this game without lags. i recomend this game if you are planing to play much because when you are beginner you dont get really much of the game and you will only met pros in misssions. 9/10
2437	1	a	I highly suggest not playing this game,unless you can get by all of the bull it has to screw with your comp you may have a fun time playing it,otherwise prepare for a trudge through some serious trouble
2439	1	a	lots of fun
2441	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
2443	1	a	I rate it 12/10, why you wonder?  Man, that feeling when you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ grind money for a car and you see one troll that wants to enter in it and he can't, I was very satisfied, until a freaking R250 cop comes and 1v5 us like we were some training dolls.   I repeat 12/10   Best story ever. I loved this game until I played it. :D
2445	1	a	I like the game its mostly like GTA so i think you sould get it.
2447	1	a	i want to play but i dont know how to fix Not RESPONDING
2449	1	a	you drive cars and shoot gun
2451	1	a	I do recommend this game, but under certain conditions.   For starters, you can not play this if you take gaming seriously. There is no matchmaking in this game at all. They claim that matchmaking is done by your ranking in the game, however their ranking system is complete and total crap. I made a new character earlier, to test this. With my BRAND NEW character, I did ONE mission. On this mission, I got one kill, and died around 7 times. (Behold, pay to win aspects, will detail later). After the mission was over, I was rocketed from bronze one, to silver 3. I skipped ALL the bronze ranks because of ONE kill.   Now maybe, you'd think, they would at least make the game fair to free players. Not everyone has money they can spend, right? How about, instead, they market their microtransactions to give you game breaking advantages that allow you to dominate every player who doesnt have them. If you get matched up against a pay-to-win player, as a free player, you can reserve your cemetary plot now, because you wont stand a chance.   'But Akalron, they have to make money right?' Yes, of course a company needs a way of generating revenue, but ruining a free players experience is not a proper way to do that. I have played FTP games where the company did just fine by selling cosmetics, not advantages. APB COULD have easily done this, but they took a less retroactive approach to it. Granted they probably generate more revenue this way because of all the players who desire a win that bad.  Heres my favorite part however. I can deal with the pay-to-win, I can deal with the bad matchmaking, but what I can't begin to fathom is their lack of optimization. This game has been out for years, and yet it still runs like its in pre-alpha development. Textures load slower than a snail, the game constantly freezes up (usually in the middle of driving or a fire-fight. Hope you didnt want to avoid hitting a wall or dying.) The loading times are atrocious. The only thing slower than how slow the textures load is how long the game takes to actually open.   My computer is no potato, I have no problems running any of the other 150+ games I have, but when this game sits there loading the district select screen for over 5 minutes? What on earth is this? Are they so focused on adding more over-powered guns for their revenue that they dont care about optimizing performance? Or are they just banking on computer hardware advancing faster than their games requirements?   I do have some positive things to say about the game however.   I have a blast playing this game. It is fun after it finally loads. Its a fantastic blend of GTA and Saints Row. It has a lot of (unlockable) customization, but also takes its gameplay moderately seriously. If you go in expecting to have fun, not expecting to win, you will enjoy yourself.   I recommend playing with friends, because if you do decide to do missions, being able to communicate will assist in winning even against pay-to-win players.  Steal a van, hop in with all your friends, vibe out to the ingame radio and gun down pedestrians like a boss. Enjoy yourself.  And for you developers who may or may not read this review: For the love of god, please fix your game, its too much fun to watch it slowly die off. I've worked for a game with a similar market strategy, and lets just say, they didnt do well. Take that as you will.
2453	1	a	asome 
2455	1	a	Drove around in a cement mixer and blew stuff up 10/10
2457	1	a	its pretty great, if just to mess around with the charecter custemization lol.
2459	1	a	Amazing alternative to gta. Awesome customization down to every single detail. 8/10 Sorry but no. So unbalanced, so glitchy. The most fun you'll have is screwing around the map killing innocent people, and trying to shoot through everybody's bullet proof glass. 3/10 Has good potential
2461	1	a	10/10 from me just wish the licence plate was a bit more readable :) All in all great game you should get.
2463	1	a	I played this during alpha when it was broken as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, would play again, maybe.
2465	1	a	LOVE this game played it for a while but i stopped i think you should make it less pay to win :D.
2467	1	a	Is a free game where.. well its basicly cops and robbers around a huge city. You can even free roam, steal cars,buy cars to customize from vendors and you can buy guns and more!really i give this game a 8/10 becuase of 1 second delay when driving.
2469	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2471	1	a	I think they should implement motorcycles.  - God Bless
2473	1	a	Okey heres the deal, this game is a hackers sandbox....with potential. All the old players understand that this game is good, it can be played for free even if its not ideal, and the customisation is what realy sets this game apart, but them hackers tho  Honestly when this game has cleared that problem up then this game will be great again, for any old player has played those matches without hacks were genuine skill were what counted and enjoyed them
2475	1	a	I played this when it was in beta even though my in game hours don't show it. I can recomend this game to others.  Pros: Easy reward system for quests. Easy to fallow Quest system. Cars with atributes that are resonable( maybe not some will come with a big price tag on them), and some what customize-able. Striat forword Totrails when offered. Unlock ranks for some guns/ cars.  Cons: Like any other game that is free there is a paiying side, is the paying side rewarded more, yes and loads I haven't played in a while and can't tell but, some times on either(cops or criminals) side there would be an extremly high level high ranking player sitting on the edge of town with a sniper shooting into spawn, halours events fallowed. Car controls last I played were jarring and unstable unsre if it was becuase of type of car. (Yes that matters alot in ths game).  I cann not say much about the rest of the fetures of the game becasue I acullty haven't exploered all that much. I may change my review later for a better desription and general knowladge.
2477	1	a	This game can get you raged as all hell, and yet once your hooked you'll keep coming back..  If you find the good side of the community, make a few friends, and get built up a little bit you'll love it.
2479	1	a	The biggest most funnest online open world multiplayer out there!
2481	1	a	It`s a good game when you play ,why,it`s very simple i know it lag a little bit but , it gives you personage customesation it`s multyplayer , have good graphics good bullet effect ... etc and i like it
2483	1	a	the game itself is great and one request from this low-spec and low internet data budget person  -please make server on singapore or filipine or indonesia , so i (or even we) can play with small and more stable ping and make the game fun to all  even though that is the only trouble i have on this game , i still recommend this game to you guys   
2485	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2487	1	a	I think they should implement motorcycles.  - God Bless

2493	1	a	It gives you a true feeling of what it is like to be a cop or criminal
2495	1	a	Amazing game.Amazing replay value.Amazing customization and really strategic game. It's amazing that it rewards players for working in team instead of forcing them to go on their own.
2497	1	a	I am Danold Rump and I want you guys to not vote for my Step-brother, thank you. 
2499	1	a	I live under the bridge after this game.... 10/10 would fall for that cash shop again.
2501	1	a	it's fun try itr out
2503	1	a	I personally like being able to customize everything in the game the way that i want, plus i really feel like i am the criminal trying to get away with crimes, and watching out for the cops so they don't catch us
2505	1	a	Its ok
2507	1	a	APB Reloaded Is A Game Full Of Violence And Crime. Which Means Good, It's Like Playing Grand Theft Auto 5 But More Violence And The Guns Are Really Cool. You Can Edit Cars And Costumize Your Character..... I Give This Game A Thumbs Up! After Playing It, It's Really Good, A Lot Of Users Killing Each Others. Enforces Vs. Criminals. Two Standards! The Standard Of Crime And The Standard Of Justice.  I Really, Really Like This Game! I Recommend This Game For You Guys, So Many Guns And ACTION!
2509	1	a	best game to play,iam addicted
2511	1	a	good a bit buggy but worth the while 9/10
2513	1	a	i dont even know how to start up the game LOL!
2515	1	a	this is one awesome game
2517	1	a	Its APB enough said
2519	1	a	Love this game to death. If you're a fan of GTA.. GET THIS! &lt;3
2521	1	a	This is a sandbox game close to GTA. Lots of this to do. Like kill a randomer. rob a car. Jump of a building. An endless variety of things to do. So click that install button. It might take a while to load but its worth it. And for those peeps who love making characters you can make a character. Choose from criminal and enforcer. Get better weapons and clothes and Rule your World!!!!!!
2523	1	a	Genuine fun. It's like GTA for poor people with crappy graphics cards.
2525	1	a	What can I say... IT'S â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AWESOME!
2527	1	a	I will recommend to all my friends
2529	1	a	A new gen GTA....well guys give it a shot!
2531	1	a	Great game I played it for 8h and bought vip its so fun and good def recomend
2533	1	a	its very fun game 
2535	1	a	I like APB:R because you could make your character as cute as possible or make it look ugly but anyway its a cops vs crims and APB:R have the best advanced customizing for characters but the only thing i dont like about it because their always have to be someone complaining or calling out hackers and stuff like that.    APB:R is a cool game for steam :D
2537	1	a	Pretty good game idk why u guys are so mean like yea it crashes it makes you play more, i dont feel like it makes me play forever im not so good at designs but i like it!!! 9/10
2539	1	a	mugged tons of people, had $5000 worth of stuff, started driving to money laundry, mission started, got shot in the face, lost all my cash  10/10 would get shot n the face again
2541	1	a	
2543	1	a	The lag on this game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke, it actually just makes you angry when you play because the server is so crap it can't handle the game itself. you get good days and bad but really, Don't drop a single cent into this game as I made the mistake of doing, you'll get owned by aimbotters who don't care if they get banned because they just create new free accounts and start all over again. I just played a game now after some time and wow, the lag made me want to throw my laptop into a wall.
2545	1	a	this game is cool
2547	1	a	As long as you play criminal, the game is fun.  If you play cop, the game is a constant grind because it is so incredibly hard to make money.
2549	1	a	gud game, the money is a pain in teh â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ doe, freakin â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es stealin from my car/van :C
2551	1	a	good a bit buggy but worth the while 9/10
2553	1	a	Very fun game but my only problem is all the micro transactions and lack of players on some servers.
2555	1	a	Fun game totally recomend for RPG players !
2557	1	a	Even tho on steam it says i have a little over 100 hours, i have around 700 hours total downloaded through GamersFirst. I love this game for its uniqueness but it isnt for everyone. If you enjoy getting matched with opponents that are either way better than you or way worse than you then you will like it. I recommend it because its worth a try and its free to play so why not? Just give it a chance!
2559	1	a	Meh it's fun for awhile
2561	1	a	11/69
2563	1	a	1. Steal a car 2. Crash the car into a shop window. 3. Rob the store and load the car. 4. Deliver stolen goods to black market dealer. 5. Repeat process.
2565	1	a	Very fun game, loads of customization towards your character, cars, guns, and gear. Its open-world and the civilian physics is hilarous. Sometimes I play just to hit people as a criminal. For a F2P, its very good.
2567	1	a	very, very, very rage inducing. Hackers and lots of them.....Pay 2 Win.....
2569	1	a	This game is fun instead of getting GTA 5 just get this game and buy a membership this game is way better than GTA 5 this actually is optimized for PC and they care about there players!
2571	1	a	i have been playing this with my friend and its actually not bad its basically a free version of GTA online or saints row with more customisation although this game relies on in game purchases you can still have fun i rate 8/10
2573	1	a	is good i met 2pac he wasnt very nice tho
2575	1	a	Its not such a bad game but if you feel like getting paired up with the highest ranks of them all Then play this
2577	1	a	Play an hour then uninstalled, month later installs again 6/10
2579	1	a	Can't even register an account.   Best uninstaller simulator, 11/10 Would uninstall again!
2581	1	a	Its pretty much a free version of GTA V if your too poor to afford GTA V  My first day.. Walk out of the Station...see three pimped out Super cars drag racing down the street...one hits a car, flips over, and exploads... Me: I think I'm gona like this game!  Second Day... Walk out of the Station...See a pimped out van driving down the streets with 2 guys hanging out the sides unloading their weapons into whoever is chaseing them...Whos chasing them? two pimped out Super cars with sirens blaring...one hit a car, flips over and explodes... Me: Yep...I'm definitly gona like this game...
2583	1	a	One time I played this game and got an errection that lasted more than 4 hours.
2585	1	a	I havent played this game but they lett me write a review for it.
2587	1	a	This is an awesome MMO Sandbox game. But the open world could have been better and the vehicle handling is just awfull. There are a lot of glitches that needs to be fixed. The graphics are good. As its free to play i recommend it.
2589	1	a	I have been playing this game for a very long time now. It is fast paced, open world and really fun. The character customization is amazing, and makes the game so much more fun. I play on both teams, enforcer and criminal. They both got their pro's and con's but they both have their own playstyle to it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes openworld RPG kind of games.
2591	1	a	Tons of fun, once you get past the learning curve and actually understand the game its awesome. Recommended to play with friends.
2593	1	a	hours of fun customizing cars and outfits aswell as lots of fun killing and driving through the streets running over pedrestrians
2595	1	a	10/10
2597	1	a	basically the free version of gta 5 and sort of gta 4 with no campaign mode and only multiplayer. The fact that it's free is amazing!, and you get the choice to be a police or a bad guy, unlike gta Overall. I really liked this game and the fact that its free is baws, so i rate it 9.5/10
2599	1	a	hi can you fix the APB reloaded it go all the way to the video and thin is go black
2601	1	a	You'll regret spending money in this game. A little, too much money.
2603	1	a	I have been playing this game for a very long time now. It is fast paced, open world and really fun. The character customization is amazing, and makes the game so much more fun. I play on both teams, enforcer and criminal. They both got their pro's and con's but they both have their own playstyle to it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes openworld RPG kind of games.
2605	1	a	I saw the reviews, I've played the game for quite a while now, And yes, I am still a silver, But the community isn't that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest thing that I saw was someone typing 'OMG NOOBS' in the chat once when we lost, but that's it..  Also, yes, the game IS P2W, but I didn't pay a single penny and I'm doing just as fine and enjoying the game.   This game is definitely a fun game, And you can enjoy playing this easily, even if it is P2W.   -The almighty Paban.
2607	1	a	APB A mix of GTA and saints row now the question is this game good  Good thing  -Customization is good  -weapons and upgrades are ballanced -classic cop vs robbers thing  -decent characters npc -grapichs are simple and good  Bad thing -you ony keep your new weapon for 7 days -The 'fair' fight system -new players -p2p to get better weapons or upgrade if you wanna rank up -minor bugs  overall 7/10 decent game to play give you the creative freedom to customize your character,car,logo and etc its very hard if your new to the system its a clone of gta and saints row which is fair the creator should really put there best effeorts in this game  BUT NO ONE CARES SO WHY ARE YOU READING THIS?!?!?!  idk thanks for reading and good luck playing p.s 80% of everyone that plays a character custonization is most likely female
2609	1	a	its aight
2611	1	a	I like this game. This game is for that people who haven't got money, because this is a f2p GTA, but this is a pay to WIN game. You can't buy premium (p2p) for pernament and without premium this game is bad for example: you can't customize your car and your charachter only 1 or 2 decals etc.
2613	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this gay game it would not let me play i could not chose a world
2615	1	a	I bet Its a good game just my computer cant handle it
2617	1	a	it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'in amazing
2619	1	a	Fun game and its even better playing with your clan mates and friends. The graphics arent bad but the game is not very well optimized. There are still a few hackers but FairFight does a good job at banning them. Overall great game!
2621	1	a	choo choo
2623	1	a	i enjoyed it very much but it does kind of fall under the p2w category sadly but over all it was pretty good
2625	1	a	This Game Is Awesome
2627	1	a	good game , endless fun with friends and customization is awesome
2629	1	a	This is a sandbox game close to GTA. Lots of this to do. Like kill a randomer. rob a car. Jump of a building. An endless variety of things to do. So click that install button. It might take a while to load but its worth it. And for those peeps who love making characters you can make a character. Choose from criminal and enforcer. Get better weapons and clothes and Rule your World!!!!!!
2631	1	a	This game is like GTA but a little bit friendlier
2633	1	a	Yes. but be prepared for certain pay to win aspects if the game, overall though great game
2635	1	a	I do reccomend it. It is a great, fun, amazing game with nice graphics and smooth gameplay. But most importantly... It's free!
2637	1	a	It is nice perfec i giwe it 10 of 10 rating
2639	1	a	Good game when you spend a little money on. :) Worth the wait of downloading
2641	1	a	lemme get this out first: THIS IS A FREE TO PLAY!!! The community is 50-50 (good-sucks) and many people are pay-to-win. But if you put enough effort, you'll find yourself fragging enemies in no time.
2643	1	a	One time I played this game and got an errection that lasted more than 4 hours.
2645	1	a	hours of fun customizing cars and outfits aswell as lots of fun killing and driving through the streets running over pedrestrians
2647	1	a	It was alright when I played, I don't know if it's been updated to be actually worth the time/money. But overall, I have to recommend to at least try it.
2649	1	a	Really nice graphics :)
2651	1	a	I started playing the game openmindedly and well yeah, Id highly recomend this game! Its alot of fun! Bit confusing at times and some aspects aren't the best but overall is a great game to play!
2653	1	a	THAT GAME IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T!!!
2655	1	a	Okay I only have a few hours on this game BUT I can honstely say for being 'FREE' it's not to bad. There is a P2W (Pay to Win for those who don't know) feel to it but not a lot of P2Wer's in the game the real problem are the hackers and oh so fearful 2 mp/h cars (You will die if struck by a car going 2 mph). AGAIN! It's free and not to bad of a game you will get mad here and there but that's life! Also so many hackers and A1 does nothing about them -_-
2657	1	a	this game is good, i made a character named LegolasTheGreat and put custom made swastikas and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on his shirt, so far ppl have been telling me that im reported and i should kill myself cuz im a nazi monster. im not getting banned long time, tho. so if u wanna burst some bubbles and make some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ butthurt - this game is for you, cuz u can design the ultimate nazi gear.
2659	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing love it  
2661	1	a	mostly anyone who plays it is a hacker but it is still cool
2663	1	a	Really cool!
2665	1	a	Im Very Sad I Need A New Computer To Run This Game :( Vista Failed Me Today It Says 'Your Video Card Does Not Meet The Minimum Requirements For Running The Game.' Please Fix This Damn Bug! P.S I Know This Is Not A Damn Bug I Spent All Night Downloading This Game So I Can Play It The Next Day!
2667	1	a	Most definitely one of the best games I've played. Fantastic graphics, fun gameplay, and with all you can customize with your player and such is awesome. One downside is it seems to be poorly optimized. I can run medium graphics on most, if not all of my other games but this one has a horrible lag issue. Other than that, fantastic game.
2669	1	a	10/10 would bang
2671	1	a	Awesome game but needs a ton of new updates. It's the same thing over and over again. G1 needs to add newer vehicles, maps, and so on. Still addicting though lol. The community is just..... -face palm-
2673	1	a	its not a bad game.....
2675	1	a	This is a good alternative game that allows some fun choices in weapons. Not your typical MMO though however as it is more of a FPSMMO w/ max server sizes of 50v50 maps on missions and smaller on quick pvp style deathmatch maps. Progression through Contacts (Mission givers) unlocks differnt guns, vehicles and cosmetic items.
2677	1	a	Really good free to play game with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ amount of customization and great community if you join a decent clan, fair warning quite a few hackers
2679	1	a	Great game , epic i can say... it doesn't even feel like a matchmaking game because it's map is so huge that you forget about that part.  Pros : You can create your own designs and apply them on about anything that you own (yea car / clothes / character / weapons , even post graifty on buildings with your own design/picture). Fun to play as hell , at least , at first. Cons: Lag , lag , lag , lag , then something amazing happens ( yea no more lag) and then again , lag lag lag lag.... The low ammount of hackers is still annoying. Pay to win. Even a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ one can produce a killing spree with a bought weapon , so you may have an idea on how overpowered are the premium weapons. Also , premium players get x3 more rewards than a normal player does. So meh , if P2W isn't a problem for you , then you may enjoy this alot! It is pretty hard to at begining at least. And the game is free so meh , i guess i should not complain about negative parts , to much.
2681	1	a	Its like a GTA but free
2683	1	a	brilliant customization and realistic crimes. i recommend this game to those people who like cops and robbers games    /\  _____ / / ___________  / __ \ / / /_ \ _ \  &gt; &lt; / / | / /_ \ \  / __ \ / / | \ \_/ \  \____ / / / |___| \_____ /  \ / \/ \/   \/ 
2685	1	a	fun game to play when you wanna kill some biittchees.
2687	1	a	Great Game
2689	1	a	This is a good game for going around and doing all kinds of stuff killing people mugging civilians it is like a 13 year olds fantasy.
2691	1	a	The game is super annoying to begin with, Match making is beyond bad. However the customization and free roam maps are great. They helped me continue to the point where I had good items to play with the better players without constant rage.
2693	1	a	it's fun try itr out
2695	1	a	I personally like being able to customize everything in the game the way that i want, plus i really feel like i am the criminal trying to get away with crimes, and watching out for the cops so they don't catch us
2697	1	a	not a bad game if i do say so myself when u play this u get a chice between gangsters and cops you get to choose aliances with major crime synidacate's and many more check it out
2699	1	a	APB Reloaded Is A Game Full Of Violence And Crime. Which Means Good, It's Like Playing Grand Theft Auto 5 But More Violence And The Guns Are Really Cool. You Can Edit Cars And Costumize Your Character..... I Give This Game A Thumbs Up! After Playing It, It's Really Good, A Lot Of Users Killing Each Others. Enforces Vs. Criminals. Two Standards! The Standard Of Crime And The Standard Of Justice.  I Really, Really Like This Game! I Recommend This Game For You Guys, So Many Guns And ACTION!

2739	1	a	better than GTA online 6/10.
2741	1	a	you can be fat and steal a tv
2743	1	a	well, the first thing i can say is the best game ever! :D (for me, at least)  APB is a pretty good game, i could recommend it to anyone, but lets see the things in it that are good and/or bad  the good things in APB: +great character customization! +great vehicle customization! +great designing/designs +great gameplay! +great graphics!  the bad things in APB: -difficult for new players (bad matchmaking :( ) -some possible 'pay to win' weapons to buy for real money -a little bad optimization -very bad community (toxic community :| :x) -cheaters  about the community, there are still a few nice people to meet, but not much.. most of the players are a**holes on APB, but dont give your hopes up! ^^ overall, i think its a really good game, its worth to try it and play it!
2745	1	a	it's fun try itr out
2747	1	a	I personally like being able to customize everything in the game the way that i want, plus i really feel like i am the criminal trying to get away with crimes, and watching out for the cops so they don't catch us
2749	1	a	This game is really fun. Though im really bad playing it with keyboard. Think im going with xbox 360 controller ( which i believe its good for some people like myself ). I recommend this game to anyone interested in 3rd person shooting games. Play if you like GTA, Sleeping Dogs and Crackdown
2751	1	a	Okey so reviewed this game way back in its CBT and just when it went live on steam, now its had time to grow and all tho alot has changed and stuff has been added its still no where near the lvl i would like them to be , however thats not to say the game is bad i was hooked to this game clocking in well over 200 hours before i even made the jump to the steam version   the only downside to the entire game is that the rendering system as well as the draw distance and the massive buggy engine made the game dip alot , at first it was overrun by hackers Then that was dealt with in the coming months , now its just performance dips and bad memory leaks , now since the time i did play this ive upraded my PC and it runs alot better at least better than it used to i think , either that or its not optimzed alot for 600 series cards and above from nvidia , but nether the less the game will be fantastic when the new engine update hits  AT LEAST we all hope so , for all we know it could get messed up just like everything else does most of the time they release new stuff.  as for the P2W aspect everyone keeps saying... hmmm yeah i can see that even tho i have spent money on the game around Â£200 worth but its defo P2W no perm weapon avaiable in game that you can actually earn or buy from contacts , and dont get me started on the weapons on the market , i sold my nano the day i got it when the joker box hit , sold it for $7.4Mill and its just as worse as today , obciously any new free player aint ever going to be able to afford that let alone afford a 1-2 Slot weapon etc fora 10 day lease , it was hard to make that money at start and it still is
2753	1	a	i shot a fish 10/10, would shoot again 
2755	1	a	BEST GAME EVER !!  Runs awesome  plays awesome  
2757	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2759	1	a	-Get some police on me -get some drugs -rob a bank -buy some guns -buy explosives -kill some civillians -go home and play APB Reloaded.  GG 101/10
2761	1	a	  Thanks !
2763	1	a	i need an understanding of this game.. i just dont get it , but its addicting ,i have fun and frustraion while playing it for hours at a time..
2765	1	a	YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!!!!!  at first your going to think that the graphics are superbad,i dont care about graphics if its a good and fun game which this.I had this for about 1 month it is a super good game i am normally a envorcer.   BEST GAME I HAVE EVER GOT BESIDES GTA5!!!!!!!!!!!
2767	1	a	I LUV IT. Thats All Folks
2769	1	a	It was alright when I played, I don't know if it's been updated to be actually worth the time/money. But overall, I have to recommend to at least try it.
2771	1	a	it is a good game
2773	1	a	APB is a better GTA. Ton of customization from your toon to your car. Its very addictive. Dont lissen to the trolls on here. Sure you can buy guns for real cash but what ftp dont have that. but keep in mind the noob starting gun is just as good as a $40 cash gun. Its about your skill no the gun.   I have to admit that there is a lot of trolls. A lot of players talk â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the game on the fourms but yet they are playing the game 7 days a week. If the game is soooo bad then why do they keep playing it?   For me this game gets a 8/10 Great customization, Great over the shoulder FPS action.
2775	1	a	I WOULD IF I HAD AN ACCOUNT WITH HIGH RANK ! :/ 
2777	1	a	First time playing this game, looks like a fun game but looks like GTA
2779	1	a	Lots of fun, if you don't mind a cops &amp; robbers style FPS that is somewhat 3rd person. Along with the fact that its VERY pay to win based. Playing it F2P is still tons better than almost every other F2P game that has P2P options.
2781	1	a	Cops chasing Robbers  or   Robbers Killing Cops  Nuff Said
2783	1	a	this game is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to say straight up its gay guys gayst possablie it sucks pooooooooooo
2785	1	a	How do i fix that .dll error?!?!
2787	1	a	It's true that this game is Pay to Win and it's not exactly newb friendly.  But if you manage to ignore the many deaths you have and just continue playing the game just to have fun instead of trying to win everything, you're in for some lots of fun.  Now I know this game is unfair at the most. But play this game long enough and just ignore all the deaths you get. Sure enough you'll get decent equipment so you won't die so much.  You just have to have patience guys. Also, bring a friend if you can.
2789	1	a	selling rare pepes please hit up my profile
2791	1	a	10/10 would play again. PS. I need a new game please.
2793	1	a	im in love. 20/10 would run over, mug, murder innocent civilians again!
2795	1	a	Amazing game, the only bad thing is it gets board over time.
2797	1	a	Downloaded game, entered the city, got into a mission, I rekt a guy, guy accused me of hacker.   10/10 would Rekt him again.
2799	1	a	APB Reloaded: The game that GTA online should've been.  Pros:  -Extremely active devs (Patches come out every 1-2 weeks) -Fairly decent engine although there will be an engine update soon -Plenty of things to do in the open world (Not including missions) -Missions have a nice variety -PVP is the best PVP I have ever seen on an open world game -Loads of fun ways to earn money -Notority Five is so much fun (Seriously, try it) -It IS NOT Pay to Win, I top 80% missions without having spent a single penny on the game -Customizable options for clothes and veichles is so huge you will never get every combination  Cons:  -Graphics -Armas Marketplace -Few hackers (Although situation has got better over time) -Golds playing in lower leagues  You might be wondering why so many negative reviews? This game sucks you in, gets you mugging, ram raiding and everything like that, you start to feel really good, and then BAM you get witnessed and killed. If you play your cards well, you can get plenty of money without being caught by the police.  The tutorial is absolutely fine and gives you some nice rewards if you complete the tutorial sections.  If you are fine with a dated game with absolutely fantastic gameplay; then grab this game... I can't explain how addicting this game really is.
2801	1	a	FUN AS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING HELL IGN 10/10
2803	1	a	its good
2805	1	a	Really nice graphics :)
2807	1	a	It is really fun
2809	1	a	Its great, i love shooting peoples face off :)
2811	1	a	i like the game but it just freezes for me when i play the game so yeah
2813	1	a	I played this game before and after it was on steam and to this date there isn't another F2p game that comes close to this mix of fps, driving and open world gaming plus a ton of customizations,.
2815	1	a	-started game -made character in hopes of creating bad @$$ yakuza boss -ended up with typical japenese thug in wife beater and jeans -robbed a black man who was a black belt in judo -got van full of stolen goods stolen by other criminals -cried 9/10 potatoes would play again
2817	1	a	A silly game that is limited to your creative.. and the sandbox missions. In reality this game beckons you to enjoy it and yourself. It's definitely a game that you want to sink your teeth in with friends, duke it out on the internet for a couple of hours and do it again and again! The game however much awesome it produces it's limited in a sense and to some this game might not meet their criteria of playable and 'fun' to a certain extent. If you're into goofy sandbox games that will have you laughing, screaming, crying, even vommitting at your screen, this is the game for you.  3/5 would bang.
2819	1	a	This game is So awsome i really recommend playing this if u love cops and robbers, teamdeath match games
2821	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2823	1	a	Love it.
2825	1	a	A really good game with lots of customisation options, really fun to play with friends, it gets patched alot and the devs fix alot of bugs. The only 'big' problem of this game is the server lag that can sometimes annoy you and make you rage quit, but all in all its a really fun game :)
2827	1	a	GTA V free ALOT OF CUSTOMIZATION 9/10
2829	1	a	Yes. but be prepared for certain pay to win aspects if the game, overall though great game
2831	1	a	not a bad game if i do say so myself when u play this u get a chice between gangsters and cops you get to choose aliances with major crime synidacate's and many more check it out
2833	1	a	Awesome game, but a bit laggy.
2835	1	a	Oh my god, please. Just get the game. 11/10 'Let's Be Bad Guys' Simulator 2014   No but really tho, get it. Sure, weapons can be bought for money, and other people have money and blah blah blibbity blah, but you can get them for free... It's like planetside, but it's cops and robbers. Who the hell doesn't like cops and robbers?!
2837	1	a	Awsome game GO AWAY REVIEW THING
2839	1	a	Better than GTA5
2841	1	a	Its Verry Cool and Verry Cool Weapons
2843	1	a	I made nazi uniforms for myself and friends, I then discoverd nazi iconography is now banned in the game. My friends and I pondered why this was so while standing on top of a burned-out car seeing who could shoot civilians at the greatest distance with the stock handgun.  I then saw a poster depicting one of the 'My Little Ponies' getting sodomized by a man, which is apparently ok to show in-game.  
2845	1	a	Be a cop so you can racially profile and randomly beat them without any reprucussions!   10/10 would beat again
2847	1	a	Many people think I'm hacking , but I'm not . 11/Gentleman Sausage
2849	1	a	awsome game :p
2851	1	a	very good....to a point....but the good is way more then the bad
2853	1	a	Pour man's gta 6/9 wood bye tis 4 free
2855	1	a	I really like this game, the events are the fun part of it all....sure there are people who are like pay-to-win but that's not the case....better guns dosn't mean better player. The costomization is amazing....this is like GTA with more costomization
2857	1	a	I've played this game for a long time, it has been great watching it grow, weather good or bad, The dev's of this game are very hardworking and in general sweg dudes. They have particularly worked on fixing the pay to win system, they don't care about money. Overall i would rate this a 7/10, its good when you start but after 500 hours it gets repetitive
2859	1	a	Cool super 
2861	1	a	cool. nice shooter doensnt seems there's alot of hackers
2863	1	a	It's not perfect.
2865	1	a	I know this game has a horrible reputation, however I am having quite a lot of fun with this game. Yes, you may run into some greifers (throw a grenade at them, explosions hurt everyone), but other than that, I have been having a lot of fun.  Excellent character, car and clothing editor, interesting mission system. Expect Call of Duty instead of WoW and you might get it.
2867	1	a	One of My Favourite Games Ever. Great Graphics. A Nice Community. Awesome Maps. Never Gets Boring. And On Top Of All We Can Do lmost Everything.
2869	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldnâ€™t find the stupid cake.
2871	1	a	fun with friends
2873	1	a	240 hours and I finally got past the loading screen!
2875	1	a	APB Is a game with endless thought of makeing cars, people ect. The only thing crappy about the game is the lag i cant stand lag but i get used to it everthing else is perfect! 11/10
2877	1	a	to spend time when u have nothing to do
2879	1	a	It don't know where to start... As I have been playing APB:Reloaded since the open beta in 2011, I came up with many things that are very good and some that are pretty horrendous.  First the pros to this game: -the best customization system I've ever seen in a game -a challenging progression curve IF you endure, but very fun -good gameplay with depth in it -replayability  And now some cons which I will go into further than into the pros: -very slow development(we are waiting for more than two years now for the engine update, nothing special was implented during that time except a new car...) -unbelievably expensive prices in the cash store(sometimes about 10â‚¬ for just a cosmetic item. You are more or less forced to pay something for this game to really be able to play it. For example, the customization is restricted for free players and you can only use it to its fullest when you have a premium membership. Though, it is pretty regular that codes for premium membership are given away)   In Overall, the game is very good and you will have your fun with it IF you are willing to get used to the gameplay and invest some money into it(about the amount of a AAA-game).
2881	1	a	Hackers, russians and germans infested pay2win game.  Only play if you have nerves of steel or alot of money.
2883	1	a	Fantastic. It is basically GTA online but not GTA? Then get this!
2885	1	a	Nice game :)
2887	1	a	11/5 IGN-   This game, was probably the best game of 2089. For the first ten minutes, i had a nerdgasm over what you can do in APB, now that i realize, its more than a game, it's a deep meaning of symbolism. Looking at that black screen for a 19 minutes made me realize, that its not even worth downloading. Its so good, even steam wont exit out becuase APB is bullying Steam, and wont let it close out, ovevrall, 1492/420 - IGN.
2889	1	a	Awesome game in my opinion, the character creation is great and it is really fun. The only downside is the hackers and lag. All in all a good game I would recommend if your into the Third Person Shooter kinda stuff.
2891	1	a	very good game, no frame drops and no problems... + amazing hitreg
2893	1	a	APB Reloaded is a very intriguing game. APB Reloaded is like an open-world game to mess around. It is a cheap version of a GTA type game and can be fun when playing with friends and families.
2895	1	a	its good game i like this game
2897	1	a	Drive by shootings. High speed driving on freeways and then hitting a ramp and soaring. Robbing shops like a boss. Shooting up Criminals like a boss. I like cars.
2899	1	a	this game.... ugh.......
2901	1	a	APB Is a game with endless thought of makeing cars, people ect. The only thing crappy about the game is the lag i cant stand lag but i get used to it everthing else is perfect! 11/10
2903	1	a	I set my balls on fire. Not in the game, I just thought I'd mention it. 10/10 like skyrim with jews.
2905	1	a	QUICK RANT, PROS+CONS BELOW  The game is good, really good. I love it. BUT SWEET MOTHER OF GOD DOES PUNKBUSTER SUCK â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 1st hour of 'playtime' - trying to get Punkbuster (APB's anti-cheating system) to work and not throw errors in my face; 2nd hour and the first half of the 3rd hour - having extreme fun, loving the game so much; the rest of my 'Playtime' - trying to get Punkbuster to work again, but I give up.  I really don't know why any game uses Punkbuster. From my experience, all games with Punkbuster have extreme amounts of bullcrap regarding being able to play (APB just confirms that once more). I'd love to recommend this game, but hell, I barely got to play it. And I will definitely not waste more time on it.  Pros+  *Really fun to play, there is just so much freedom *Has that GTA 5 feel to it - not exactly it, but something of it's own *Obtaining standart currency (cash) is pretty easy, fast and painless, so it shouldn't take you more than a couple hours (MAX) to obtain a new piece of gear *The difference between being a premium or free player is simply progression speed - and both are pretty close together to each other  Cons-  *As stated in my rant, it uses the Punkbuster anti-cheat. It throws up so many false flags that it's even pepe-worthy. That'd would be a really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in rare pepe tho...I gotta make that now *Some guns are just straight up better than others, and there's nothing you can do (only exception being your and your enemy's reaction times - that alone can sometimes kill you or the enemy) *It appears that headshots are not a thing in this game. Heads have no model, so good aim isn't rewarded all that much. As an FPS vet, this seems really weird to me  CONCLUSION  This game is great beyond 'it shows potential', it is so much fun even if you're alone (with friends, it is CONSIDERABLY more fun though), but Punkbuster and some minor balance issues are holding this game down. If you have a pretty good computer and Punkbuster doesn't drown you in errors, I can GUARANTEE you'll enjoy this game (at the very least).
2907	1	a	Pretty good only the graphics really takes space even though its yeahno quality graphics i do reccomend this game
2909	1	a	You know, I enjoyed this game......then well â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happened  never left beta to many hackers â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mactch making system  so over all one of the best games ive ever played!
2911	1	a	Fun game with my friends .
2913	1	a	crashed on startup.
2915	1	a	I set my balls on fire. Not in the game, I just thought I'd mention it. 10/10 like skyrim with jews.
2917	1	a	i like garbage games and this one is my favorite
2919	1	a	I've played this game so many hours (mostly before i have been released on steam). I have spent so many hours in the social district to create and design my own clothes and cars. To sell them for a good amount of ingame money.  But also the multiplayer experience is fun.  It brings some issues with it but i think it is still enjoyable.  Pros:  -open world -fully customizable cars and clothes -quick missions with a lot of action -aimbased shooter -a quiet nice community  Contras: -a lot of hackers -sometimes laggy -update dates takes too long
2921	1	a	Fun and addicting.
2923	1	a	very good game, no frame drops and no problems... + amazing hitreg
2925	1	a	Cool

2929	1	a	I chased the Pink Nixon and found he was indeed a crook.
2931	1	a	Fun game with my friends .
2933	1	a	A bad MMO and a bad third person shooter, with amazing customization. Bareable for a little while and fun for even less, but is a decent waste of your time; especially while listening to a podcast.
2935	1	a	Great game, bad hosting company.
2937	1	a	Cool
2939	1	a	meh....also the nutshack is a great show
2941	1	a	great game to play, tho you can very easily can get banned or kicked from joining online servers, for doing the petiest things wrong...
2943	1	a	its a berry good game and its free.
2945	1	a	Give it a chance,dont write bad reviews about it if you play for 1 hour  *Please fix the achivements in steam,they are bugged*
2947	1	a	This game is so much fun! I find it fun for a free game and i dont like free games.

2951	1	a	APB Reloaded. You could compare it too Grand Theft Auto online. There are 2 groups, Enforcers and Criminals. They both have their strong and weak points. Personally I find Enforcers easier to level up, but Criminals are easier to get money with. You can buy weapons, clothes, songs (for your player) and cars. All of those are also completely customizable! Just a car with 1 color? Fine! A car with 5 colors and 20 cool art things on it? Fine! Everything is possible. You can even design your own logo's, which is awesome! Everyone does that and you can see a lot of creative people. There are some logo's that are intimidating, but you'll just have to deal with it.  There is an option to buy items with in-game money or with real money, via the store. Both are great ways to get better items.  Most of the features in the game are good, still there are some bad ones. There are for example quite some hackers, really frustrating and the staff doesn't do anything about that, or at least, not much. There are also some really overpowered weapons, like the OSMAW, a Rocketlauncher that kind of insta-kills you, really no-skilled. Luckily it's a main weapon, so you will have to exchange it for an assault rifle and the launcher is empty quick.  Missions are fun, randomly getting people from the other faction against you. It's actually a simple attack/defend mission, most of the time. Sometimes there are 'capture the flag'-missions, 'dominion'-missions and simple 'team-deathmatch'-missions. Sometimes the matchmaking isn't as equal is people would like to though.  I recommend everyone to play it. It is awesome, fun and challenging. Beware, you do need a computer with some good hardware, if you do not have that, you will have problems running it. Just install the game on Steam, it's free-to-play and the game isn't that big to download. If you like shooters, racing and an open-world game, this is for you.   Rating: 7.5/10 Not a 7, because that's too low, not an 8 because it's not good enough for that. Still worth a try
2953	1	a	 I'd like to start this review by saying that this review is coming from a late 2011 to early 2012 veteran.   This is by far the game i have most played hours in and they're still going up. Overall i belive that this is a great game despite all the negative reviews and issues with it. Now i could sit here and list all the flaws with the game, but where's the fun in that? If you're able to look over some of the problems and get a few friends together to play this game, you'll probably not regret it.     Now to some common misconceptions...    This game is  not  pay to win.  Alot of people tend to think that because there are so many items you can buy through armas  (their real life money store) . But truth be told, most are just reskins of weapons that you can buy in-game by just playing the game. I'd say that the N-Tec  (their version of the AK)  is one of / if not the best weapon in the game. Which you can ofcoarse buy for in-game money or reskins on armas.   There are not as many hackers in this game as people belive.  There will ALWAYS be hackers in a free to play game. But alot of people think that every other player is hacking. I belive that this is not the case. I can't even remember the last time i faced a player i was sure cheated in some way. Most of the time it's that they have far better teamwork than you. They might be sitting in teamspeak giving out information to their teammates and so on. This is after all a team game. Like in CS:GO you're bound to do better in a team then you are on you own with randoms.     Here's a couple of tips for new players...    Do  NOT  join silver districts nor open conflict. When selecting a dristrict go into the advanced tab in the top-left corner and join a bronze district. All good players are in silver districts because of the way they have  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up  made that system.   This game is extreamly CPU heavy. I for example have a 6700k. I get stable 100 FPS  (which is the cap with a 60hz monitor) . I used to have an AMD 8350. With the AMD i barley got 70 FPS and very commonly dropped to 40 FPS. You'll also need more than 4 gig RAM despite it saying that in the recommended. But you'll have to try out for yourself.     I did not cover the flaws in this review because if i do you'll just go and look for them. Enjoy the game as much as you can. This is despite all a very fun game, hence the positive review.    IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR WANT TO YELL AT ME FOR GIVING A POSITIVE REVIEW PLEASE COMMENT ON THIS REVIEW AND I'LL ANSWER.

2957	1	a	gave me adware  10/10 pay for a lot of content simulator
2959	1	a	Well, it was so nice to start this game at the beginning couple of years ago (I don't play on steam, i just prefer to play from GamersFirst launcher. I've got over 400 hours on APB.), It was, really. A lot of helpful players that can make you really happy. I had a pretty good clan when i started. I was having so much fun. They were really making a game that worths every single hour in the game. For a year I wasn't able to play the game. For a year i waited to play this game again and after some time I went back to game. A LOT of stuff changed for me. The new threat system, new fight clubs map, bounties, a lot of new weapons, new cars... At first I really liked it again. But after some time i realised that if you don't give tons of money to game to play properly, you can't have fun with this game..   Bad things after the change: -Good palyers have become â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, (I've spent enough time to understand who is good and bad. There is no such thing as good (by good i'm trying to say helpful) player anymore...) -The currency of the game is not apb dollars, it's just the real money itself (So sad to think that i have donated over $50 to this game..) -The developers are just greedy people, (They make a weapon that you can only buy with real money in every patch...) -The potential of the game is just perfect but they really ruined it over the last year.. -Oh, I forgot the terrible matchmaking system. If you don't get rekt (i couldn't even say wrecked, it's THAT bad.) by couple of guys with the best weapons and with the highest ranks, you are one lucky guy..  Good thing i can still say: -One word: Customization. It's like you are playing The Sims with guns! It's awesome to create yourselves that you want to be deep down in your heart. -Graphics are not important most of the time, but i have to say this game was one of the best visual game of his time. They are still good but there is a collection of 'Next Gen Games' now. But still, i really like the visuals of the game.  There are still things that i can tell (Most of them are negative), but at the first sight you can see these ones. My overall rating to this game is 4.5-5/10, BUT if the developers ever listen to our complains to the game just once, this game can go up to 10 out of 10 by arranging APB to a free game(It's not just that, by polishing the bugs, removing the half of the population of the game(I'm talking about cheaters of course...etc.), even it's close to impossible. If they do that my feelings can get back the way it used to be. 
2961	1	a	i havent played it yet
2963	1	a	Really fun game.
2965	1	a	i love this game and dont even mind paying for a car n a gun this kept me going while i awaited gta V for pc but the server lag is unbareable and near unaccepible for a game like this what requires a good connection, i last played months ago for halloween but i got the same feeling when i sat and played gta V after the hours of download and install to finally play i sit there and then watch youtube videos for the next 4 hours wondering how these guys seem to have so much fun in said games but yea seeing as it free to start off and mission and heists earn you cash to rent weapons and buy cars and mods from trade i do recommend this game so really you dont have to spend a penny but it takes some effort
2967	1	a	If you like GTA, you'll love this game! Lots of fun, and it's free! Just don't get too upset about those who pay to win.
2969	1	a	1900hrs on my Crim and I still play regularly and have fun setting my own goals, and with the engine upgrade just around the corner and with it the console release I find my self more and more excited for the future of this game.

2997	1	a	This is a very great game, i love this game! Its the best game i have seen some its free&lt;3
2999	1	a	Best Game! :3 You Should Try it. :P
3001	1	a	APB:Reloaded is a fun game, but not without its flaws. Its like GTA, but better, at least in terms of gameplay and customization.  Pros:   1. You can customize pretty much everything, you can take a duck symbol, put it on a wall, then your character, your clothes, and your car, and actaully be unique.  2. The game play is supurb, there's no BS like headshots or or having to worry about your teammate running you over because 'lag'. The games gunplay is also really good, it is RNG based so a few weapons dont like hitting things, but other wise really good.  3. The game caters to a lot of types of people, more so those who can design, It can bring out everys inner creativity if you let it.   Cons:  1. Performance is WAY down in the dumps, heavy stuttering, and highly populated zones can cause serious FPS drops.  2. Server performance is also poor, the RNG and hitbox systems seem to hate Shotguns the most. As well as random 'visual' oddities that can sometimes be manipulated at will.  3. The game has been suffering from hackers/cheaters but as of recent, that has died down a lot. But sometimes, due to lag, you may see people 'snap' or moonwalking, so its sometimes hard to tell.  4. The ARMAS market place can get pretty pricey, $60 for one account permanent gun is quite high.   All in all, its a fun game, but only if you can ignore the client and server performance issues. Keep an eye out for the Engine upgrade next year though, that should nullify a majority of performance issues that we are seeing.
3003	1	a	I played APB Reloaded back during release for well over a year. I really enjoyed it. From making custom sprays for your vehicle right down to making new friends. The community was very enjoyable too! The amount of customization just keeps growing as time passes. The only negatives I can think of would be being able to perma buy guns but it has been a while since I played. Back before the current ranking system as well. Overall if you can find some buddies to play with it really ups the replayability of the game but it is always worth a few good laughs at any hour of the night.   Give it a try, you will enjoy it! 7/10 from myself.
3005	1	a	  Artistically &amp; imaginatively freeing for me. You can keep scrolling if you wanna know about the PvP :P
3007	1	a	I rarely play it but it's still fun! when i started i no lifed the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of it 258 hours wasted i mean spended well.
3009	1	a	I would recommend this game but can you pleae fix the god dang launcher its not working on steam i had to go all the way to go to extra time to go onto gamersfirst live again to get the proper launcher to play :/
3011	1	a	Well... not bad, not much good... I think you just need to try it...yeah...  SCORE: 69/100 (I guess)
3013	1	a	much graphics very music so pew pew pew wow
3015	1	a	Great mmo!
3017	1	a	Super game. been hacking since day one.   Fun to hear kids cry.  Helios hack FTW !!!
3019	1	a	Super game. been hacking since day one.   Fun to hear kids cry.  Helios hack FTW !!!
3021	1	a	Much lag much fps drops..... If fps were good it would be 10 but with that its 7
3023	1	a	Its a great game *cough* If you do the missions.
3025	1	a	Its funny to do this game with ur friends , so dont play this alone.
3027	1	a	Great game! Try it out its free, nothing to lose, great graphics, gameplay and a lot of different customizations.
3029	1	a	only if there was a medieval game like this
3031	1	a	I have no idea what's going on
3033	1	a	Ok, very nice, but when i spend 1000$ for ammo, i can't use it!
3035	1	a	My neighbours complain when i die.
3037	1	a	it's really what gta online should have been if it weren't for sharkcard shilling and rockstar being literal autism
3039	1	a	its ok
3041	1	a	the second gta v online very nice game i recommend:)
3043	1	a	First impression of the game was great. However, as I progressed, and looked around, did research... I discovered that the game is indeed pay to win, with an over priced cash shop to boot.  That aside, Strong weapons don't give you skill. You can outplay a cash weapon, but God help you if you have an aimbotter with one. Yes, this game is full of hackers. Hell, today I was up against someone named 'NxT' Who has horrible, horrible aim just two days ago. Now suddenly, they have near perfect aim, no matter where you go, where you juke, where you jump, it hits. This isn't a rare case, a lot of people hack, and the community denies it, along with denying claims of pay to win. Side note, yesterday I saw someone running on foot, faster than any car in the game. Aimbot: Check. Speed hacks: Check.  NOW. If you can put those aside, it's actually an extremely fun game, it's fun to jsut â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around, make decals to sell, cruise around and 'accidentally' hit someone that's clearly in a mission, ruining what he's doing. If you're the type to be able to find fun as a free player that can enjoy his time, working around hackers and going on a grind for other weapons, then I will recommend this game.  If you're the type to really care about a fair fight (We'll get to Fair Fight after this bit) then I cannot recommend this game. You will find a lot of hackers and cashers that think they're super cool to have stats that you can only get by paying $40 bucks for one weapon.  Onto Fair Fight, APB's pride and joy of an anti cheat system. Yeah, it's complete trash. They have an over priced cash shop, and don't spring for real anti cheating. I'm being completely honest when I say that 1 out of 10 hackers are banned, and the one ban is still very rare.  TLDR? Recommended if you're not a tryhard.  I myself enjoy the game, being a free player that plans to not spend a dime on the game, so this review ends in recommended simply due to my own enjoyment.
3045	1	a	The best mmofps game ever, really.  I agree to people saying 'game is ptw blah blah blah' BUT there are a lot of weapons already to choose which works very good, just you need skills, TBH didnt play this game for 1 year, then downloaded and i still had skill to be on top with 40 kills in a mission lol.  Matchmaking is really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, there are always people matched in groups which has everything maxed out... This game would be the best if it didnt have threats... No gold, bronze or silver, because of this matchmaking is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, there must be only one order of ranks, like csgo, has and other mmo games.  Game is really competetive, and as i said, its the best one you will ever find as mmo fps as you can drive a car do some crazy stuff. I am running on pretty old pc sure using some low settings, but game is still having some laggs even people says that on even a gaming pc this game would lag, and im waiting for an update for engine... so yeah. Devs should look more into quality not into money.
3047	1	a	A very good game. Recomanded
3049	1	a	1 of the words best game 
3051	1	a	A godd gta-i game its a fun TPS the costumazation is endless going from masks to tattos but a lot of cool features need premium acc whitch requires real invested money,there is no single player but the multiplayer ist that much laggy and the grapich are deccent for a free game.The controls are tricky but the options menu takes care of that.I would reccomend this game to any gta fan ,
3053	1	a	i love this game.It has it's flaws though.
3055	1	a	The clothing content of this game is doable, the cars are pretty cool especially the Jericho my favorite just putting it out there, and the guns here range from simple to skilled depending on your preferance. There are plenty of sales that goes on throughout the year so u have plenty of chances to buy your necessary guns and equipment to take down your opponent. Play more in groups more than solo gameplay to get a more greater experience playing this game. This game is not the best stress reliever. TAKE TIME OFF from playing this game as well for YOU WILL get mad on several occasions playing APB. THIS GAME IS FULL OF BLATANT HACKERS and bad mouth people. Not recommend to play for any age. Find another game to play
3057	1	a	This game is amazing!!!
3059	1	a	The hacking is out of control. 5/10
3061	1	a	Fun game, although you can get pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sometimes.
3063	1	a	Very realistic game. Recommending it for everyone.

3067	1	a	the only game where you can dress up as a teenage mutant ninja turtle driving in a jurassic park car game of the year 2076
3069	1	a	COOL GAME LIKE GTA 5
3071	1	a	Best Game ever you dont need to pay a thing
3073	1	a	Well game :P
3075	1	a	If you like rage inducing games, pay to win and somewhat fast paced 3rd person MMO then this is a game for you.
3077	1	a	it's a relli good game nice graphics but check it before downloading tht u can run it or not k if not dont worry ask me on steam k :)
3079	1	a	best part was when i unistalled it
3081	1	a	Robbing people and places with your friends is fun, especially the ones who have been robbing the people blind. Some say we are modern day Robin Hoods and others they just dont understand that we have a choice. Newton once said 'For every action there is always a equal and opposite reaction.'. This is our reaction, am i a criminal i dont think so, everyone needs a job right?, we all need a Payday.
3083	1	a	I've been unfairly matched against Max Ranks, Carbine'd directly into insanity, and glitched out of so many missions to the point I ask myself why I still pick up the mouse and try.  Favorite Game I have, GOTY 11/10 Would reccomend to friends and enemies alike.  EDIT: a year later and I still feel the exact same.
3085	1	a	10/10 hit a guy with a baseball bat
3087	1	a	Much lag much fps drops..... If fps were good it would be 10 but with that its 7
3089	1	a	ITS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED
3091	1	a	I can not start it op and they say its Running always :( 
3093	1	a	It's like a free multiplayer version of gta iv. Works pretty good, but missions can be a little basic and very repetitive. Still its a good time killer.
3095	1	a	Great game, don't know why so many bad reviews on the game, in my opinion it's one of the best games you would find on steam, for free!
3097	1	a	This game is for those that don't have the money to get GTA. It's mostly P2W as most cool features are for members only, but if u can deal with that then the game isn't all that bad.
3099	1	a	This game ruined my life. I love it.
3101	1	a	good gmae. long loading screens
3103	1	a	this game is beast
3105	1	a	Used to be really good. Now it's mostly about who can pay the most to win. Yet you can still enjoy it sometimes.
3107	1	a	Great Game I recommend for everyone to play. :)
3109	1	a	This Game is fun!!! :D
3111	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fantastic
3113	1	a	I just got a free Minecraft gift code from ï»¿http://freeminecraftgiftcode
3115	1	a	Very realistic game. Recommending it for everyone.
3117	1	a	
3119	1	a	Great game. I wish i could play it
3121	1	a	This game is very addicting! Great game to play with friends!
3123	1	a	The game is fairly decent, but I think more can be done to make this game perfect. One of things I believe this game needs is some sort of Campaign or PvE mode. Why you may ask? Well, due to the fact that not everyone is professional at PvP battles. Something like that would defintiely make this FTP game a whole lot more fun. That, and it would probably bring in a lot more players into the game as well.  And with that being said, it's a decent game. Just not perfect...
3125	1	a	Good Game for free 
3127	1	a	much die so law enforcement  very MMO wow.
3129	1	a	APB Reloaded is a F2P version of an old game APB. Theis version ghas better graphics and more content. You shuold totally play this game, here's why: Character customization Vehicle customization Intensivity Freedom 9.5/10
3131	1	a	:)
3133	1	a	much die so law enforcement  very MMO wow.
3135	1	a	  Liked this. But dislike all the hacks
3137	1	a	the best free-to-play on steam in my opinion
3139	1	a	The game is fairly decent, but I think more can be done to make this game perfect. One of things I believe this game needs is some sort of Campaign or PvE mode. Why you may ask?

3151	1	a	i love the customization in the game 
3153	1	a	a great alternative to GTA 5 for those who can't get it. Plays like GTA and is online.
3155	1	a	Allowed me to review the game before I downloaded it , so I say: -11.35853595837594/-10 because glitchin review. Trololololololololol

3239	1	a	Arrested someone for holding a TV. 10/10
3241	1	a	Well, When I Play this Game, its fun As Hell. Its Free to Play, so Dont even look at those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ reviews 
3243	1	a	Played APB off and on for a long time before i even had a steam account. The game is definantly worth playing. Why? To be honest, jsut gives you something to do. This game is designed to be played from time to time, or atleast it feels that way. Anyone who reviews this game as a game you paly every single day is doing it wrong. The game has some major issues. Has hackers, ect. The way to avoid this is to stay within bronze and silver threat level, no hacker is going to be bronze or silver, they will be gold. People who pay to win wont be bronze or silver, they will be gold. I let the Pay to win players, and the Hackers go at it, and enjoy some decent well matched game play with some bronze and silver threat level player that dont pay to win nor hack. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. If custimization, and fast paced game play is your style, this is the game for you. If you are strictly in to just killing people and happen to be some CoD fanboy, this probably isnt your style.
3245	1	a	i love to play this game 
3247	1	a	
3249	1	a	I dont really like the gun play but is cool and stuff...I think 6/10 penuts
3251	1	a	I don't think i've ever spent as much money on a game as this one.
3253	1	a	it ascn very nocie
3255	1	a	APB Reloaded is a free to play game that allows the player to either be a crimminal or enforcer, or both. With all the guns, cars, accesories, and missions, this game is something you should definetly play
3257	1	a	ON my last pc i could not play (windows 8) but so far from videos (not gameplay) it looks good!
3259	1	a	Nice third person shooter game, i recommen this to everybody!
3261	1	a	Unlike said, the game is still playable and not p2w
3263	1	a	People are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, devs tryina jew the money outta you, can be buggy and rather demanding on your system. 10/10 if you're a lil â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ just like them.
3265	1	a	Its a cool game play ir
3267	1	a	ways to start a carathter  1: download game 2: make a account 3: start 4:chose a side 5:when side chosen wait througt a 5 minute unskipable cut scene 6:play {number seven and beaond is for old computers} 7:game lags like a guy waiting for his favriote smosh video to buffer 8:delete game 9:delete steam coase you think no other game will run 10: if you havent deleted steam you probly forgot fallout 1 and 2 will run with classic option  sighed cupotea178 . :D XD ;D :' ---------------------------------------
3269	1	a	Very cool game :)
3271	1	a	Errrrmmmm idk never played the game.
3273	1	a	Fun game, best open world cops vs robbers game out there for f2p players best than Gta lol
3275	1	a	yes great game has gun driving i love it cool im not rlly hard and it fun trying rob but rlly havent tried a cop but i love crimal it a good it kinda like saint row and gta blend in with other shooter games
3277	1	a	Slowly grinding my way up to supreme â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bag, today I was able to kill 2 people and get 1 assist.  10/10 would die for my pride again.
3279	1	a	lol this game still gets updated?
3281	1	a	it sucks, constantly drains me, and screaming, and im not talking about my girlfriend
3283	1	a	This game is so wonderful. Ive spent over 300 hours playing and i plan to continue to play for many many many more hours. The cheaters in the game? its nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. I only encounter 1 cheater every 60-100 mathces. Even then, they aren't ridiculously blanant and only have some sort of aim assistance, but you can still beat them if you are any good at the game. The game doesn't run the best, but they are working on a new engine and really want to have it up soon. If we got more people to come into all of these servers and get a little more revenue going towards the developers, we might actually see big improvements in this game. It has the potential to be an awe inspiring game that we play for years to come. I seriously recommend trying this game, the learning curve can be a little steep at first, but its nothing you cant get over. The community isn't always bad either, quite a few people are willing to help if you simply ask. Over all, one of my favorite all time games, i seriously recommend it
3285	1	a	I love this game! rank 200+ . Amazing video btw ;) like the music. Totaly good game.. Maybe get better Physics?? because sometimes my cars flyin of just touching stuff :P
3287	1	a	Good, I guess.
3289	1	a	this game is pretty cool, on max quality it looks like GTA 4, AND ITS FREE
3291	1	a	Very cool game :)
3293	1	a	.
3295	1	a	Not the most riveting game of all time. It's VERY much a grind, the community is HORRIBLE, mostly just trolls and not only do the mods and GMs not care about trolling, they take an active part in it. They SAY cashshoping is 'balanced' and doesn't give cashshoppers an unfair advantage, but that SO isn't true.  The good, though? Pretty much unparalleled customization. Customizable clothes. Customizable cars. Even customizable MIDI-ish themes you opponent hears when you kill them.  This game seems to love to tap into that primal part of your brain that makes you want to show off your decaled-up car to the masses.    It's a time-killer, but definitely not something I'd pay money into. But that's just me. Paying into it apparantly DOES help the game progress faster... no joke, it gives you extra 'standing' and money.

3299	1	a	Kind of like GTA Online.
3301	1	a	Good, I guess.
3303	1	a	It ok
3305	1	a	I have been playing this game ever since early 2011, and still to this day the events are epic and the updates are frequent. The game used to be owned by RealTime Worlds but then was bought by Gamersfirst, ever since then the games performance was dropped significantly. The servers are more unstable, they crash a half a dozen times weekly, and recently while I was online the servers completely froze for a good half a minute. The chat was flooding with complaints from players but it was pretty funny if you ask me. Hackers are uncommon on this game which is good.  A few of the reasons why I still continue to put up with this game is because of the player freedom and community. The character customization is very complex. For example, there are like 4 different customization sliders just for your characters nose. The clothing and character customization is so vast that I have seen players in-game dressed as Ronald Mc'Donald, The Joker, Harly Quinn, celebreties such as Justin Bieber, Tupac, Will Smith, Bill O'Reilly, Obama, Chuck Testa, Youtubers, and many more.  The vehicle customization is also huge and with certain vehicle modifications, such as Nitro 3, you can do stunts and jumps in a district and impress some people.   The game is very unique as far as the character customization and free roam aspect. I'd give it a 7.5/10 due to the servers preformance and the fact that many people get falsely banned quite frequently due to 3rd party programs when they never even did anything wrong. I'v lost friends that have just one day disapeared from this happening to them, it's depressing that the G1 staff don't help at all when it comes to unbanning. If you get banned on this game permanently for any reason at all, don't expect on getting it unbanned.
3307	1	a	this is, well play it yourself and see...
3309	1	a	Yeah there may be hacker but what would you expect from anygame of chorse there going be hacker we cant help how other people are but for you hater out there i recommend you get over it because there hacker everywhere even in new games. there alway will be.
3311	1	a	This game is really fun! Most people dislike this because of the graphics! If you go into the settings you can change it. Remember this game is free! I recommend this game
3313	1	a	 http://i.imgur.com/PO1Au.png 
3315	1	a	This game is both good and bad in many ways. Only really great thing is the customization. Servers are awful and very laggy, most of the time. Too many ARMAS weapons, way too many re-skins in the marketplace as well. (even though I have purchased a decent bit from armas) Missions are very repetitive, but who really reads the descriptions of them. The objectives seem to spawn in different areas often, but you may end up with the same actions there. Defend this, raid that, kill the enemy. And this game still has, in my opinion, one of the worst communities in gaming. Do good last mission? Everyone thinks you hack. Did bad? Your a noob. Using a armas gun? Noob. Using a free gun? Hacker. Im not even going to say anything about G1. EA is a better company, and look at what they did with BF4. (I know firsthand the brokenfield 4 problems) If you can ignore the ARMAS marketplace and the servers, APB: Reloaded is worth a try if you like free roam games. Or if you love the idea of playing cops and robbers in a MMO form.
3317	1	a	we in htis build about to get crunk eyebrows on fleek du fuuuuu 
3319	1	a	I don't know enough to talk about it.
3321	1	a	'I just wanna know how it feels, ya know, realizing that you're trapped in a situation where you are just losing control of the city.'  'That's a matter of opinion.'  'Opinion? Yea there's your opinion and then there's the truth.'  'Any comment on the nightmare Darren graffiti I see all over town these days? Aren't you worried you might have a public perception problem?'  'I don't worry about what criminals are writing on walls DicÄ¸. A safer San Paro, that's what I promised at the election, that's what I'm delivering.'

3323	1	a	Best game ever 9/11 unforgettable if you thought dota was a good game w8 till you get your hands on this
3325	1	a	Best, Game, Ever... Or... Atleast It's Potential, It Still Needs Alot Of Work, But The Idea Behind The Game, Is Brilliant.
3327	1	a	pros basicly gta online  cons  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ optimization  -Alien ware alpha i3
3329	1	a	Don't hate the player, Don't hate the game, Hate the troop man, we take all blame. That you got no money, you got no fame, That you got no honeys, you got no name.  (atleast try it, you wont survive more than a day without your wallet)
3331	1	a	APB Reloaded is an awesome MMO with a slick addition of adding RPG elements to the game.  The pros: There are 2 sides, Enforcers and Criminals. Both sides have their own Private Vehicle(s) which the owner could later customize and just make it look badass to say the very least. There is a wide veriety of different weapons which you will be thrilled to have once you buy them. Criminals can actually commit crimes and then get busted by the Enforcers. It's a very nicely polished game over all, so download it, it's free!  The cons: Starting out without a real tutorial is fustrating and you will be walking around the map, mugging citizens, stealing cars, and shooting everything until, of course, you will run out of ammo. One team with OP items can be enialating the other team with newbies that only have starter pistols.
3333	1	a	This game is something like GTA but Customizable character,,, I Like that :)
3335	1	a	If you consider paying for a cosmetic change that you could do anyway without paying P2W, then this would be P2W. That is not, however, what P2W actually is, and if you consider games that need money to survive as being P2W then you are a truly sad individual and will likely end up poor and alone.

3339	1	a	Fantasitc game, it's dead now though D;
3341	1	a	This game is a hit or miss for some people. There are so many problems you will want to scream but the one thing that keeps me so hooked is how unique this game is. It's not like an MMO where I can just quit and pick up another with some minor differences and a setting chance. The gameplay is one of a kind and I wish someone would create a better game with the same concept and gameplay but this is all we have so I reccomend trying it out for yourself and decide yourself by playing the game instead of deciding by reading negative reviews.
3343	1	a	APB is a large scale free-roam third person free to play shooter. Especially fun with friends. The Game takes place in San Paro, a city ravaged with crime. there are two sides enforcer and criminals. The customazation is deep on all levels. You are able to go on missions and battle against the enemy organization for a objective.
3345	1	a	Is Very Gud Game!
3347	1	a	Really Good Action-Adventure And Third-Person Shooter With Co-op Missions!
3349	1	a	ight game. 8-10
3351	1	a	probably the most gangsta game i've ever played my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3353	1	a	I don't remember buying or playing this game. I don't know how it ended up on my Steam Account â€“ it doesn't ring a bell at all! I have purchased far too many games on Steam and this is what happens when you do! Despite having no memory of it, I'll surmise it's a really great game. It might possibly be, the best fun I cannot remember having! Could it even be possible, that I've also played it more than Killing Floor?
3355	1	a	i reccomend this game if you are going to play with a group of 2 or more, if i had to point out a negative about this game it is that it takes abit of time to launch so if yours doesnt open up instantly give it sometime,
3357	1	a	 http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=c6c18dcff1b4d22ca36ee6651b3c8bc0&amp;t=2316602   THIS... READ IT! Cuz its VERY present in the game you (almost) wont find a signle server without a hax/cheater.  The game is still very enjoyable, when you got a decent team. Do know the hax CAN be defeated theyre limited in their hax.   Worth to pay for ? NO, not at all.... Worth to play ? Yes, definitely... Well and it is FREE to play now :) 
3359	1	a	I press K Wait for Opp Get 2 gold and 1 bronze Get my a** kicked Rage and get off game Start over
3361	1	a	This Game Is only fun with friends but if you are anti social and want to play a dumbed down GTA clone with other people this game is perfect for you
3363	1	a	I put a yes as it isn't too bad a game anymore (used to be very buggy and had insane car lag; since for some reason they're server side). While there are still pay to win elements it doesnt seem as prevelant. If you have a decent computer and some friends it can be plenty of fun.
3365	1	a	Is Good Game!!!!
3367	1	a	Not bad for a free game however as soon as you start the game you instantly feel the pressure of microtransactions.
3369	1	a	Epic! i recommend it
3371	1	a	Cool game :)
3373	1	a	APB is a very nice game but too bad I mean get stuck in the game I play 2-3 minutes and locks. Pretty please help me. Thanks
3375	1	a	this game is aids
3377	1	a	Fun game. Lots of hackers. Pay to win.
3379	1	a	Flawless idea, Flawed in practice.
3381	1	a	WOOT WOOT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GTA GO THIS jk Still really good 
3383	1	a	Customizing is da â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3385	1	a	it's like watch dogs but it isn't complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3387	1	a	It is here, where you will step into the dumptruck...and into history.
3389	1	a	It's kind of like GTA but with more grinding and hella unbalanced weapons. You'll rage a lot, but it's such a wonky and silly game that you'll enjoy it anyway. But bring a friend, if you do.
3391	1	a	MONSTER NICE ! CUSTOM CUSTOM CUSTOM EVERYTHING IS CUSTOM!!! :DDD
3393	1	a	Nothing's more fun than cruising down the street with three guys hanging out the windows gunz blazing. The customization is really impressive, you can create characters and vehicles fresh from imagination and even compose a little tune that plays when you kill someone =) Oh, and it's free!
3395	1	a	Beast multiplayer if you play with friends!
3397	1	a	hea :)
3399	1	a	APB is a very good game. Belongs to the sand table style game can be where you let all can go. There are many ways to do the task, very interesting
3401	1	a	Guns should not be temporary, especially ones bought in DLC Packs  Customization is very lacking for those who dont want to spend 30 bucks on this  Needs more accessible prices, or like atleast a one time fee to unlock the whole game.  6/10 It's repetitive, a bit lacking, and you will find vacant servers, but if you get a friend, it can be fun seeing who is the worst driver.
3403	1	a	One of the best games i have played in a long time, 9/10!
3405	1	a	dude this game is a o mazing 
3407	1	a	This is a great open world, free to play shooter giving multiple missions and vehicles to mess around with (as well as loads of guns.) The graphics are great, gameplay is fluid and exhilirating and the game hooks you in and makes you want to play more.  Only few criticisms I can give is that the missions are fairly repetitive, and that there are sometimes giant lag spikes (this could just be due to my internet of course.)   I recommend this game and I would give it an 8/10.
3409	1	a	Noting special but good.
3411	1	a	lag the f out man XD!!!! 
3413	1	a	It was fun
3415	1	a	good game but it has some stability issues
3417	1	a	its a good game but right now it wont let me play it :/ for some reason
3419	1	a	Great vigilante vs. criminal game, brings you lots of fun, can be confusing in the start but will bring many hours of joy!
3421	1	a	dont play this game
3423	1	a	did i even have this game?
3425	1	a	Awesome game +1 i recommend.
3427	1	a	Fun game, if GTA and SR3 had babys, this would be the baby.
3429	1	a	One of those games that has so many flaws and so many great things all smooshed up into a clusterfck of addictiveness. After 6 years I hope the engine update brings new life to this mess.
3431	1	a	My favorite game of all time. been playing for 4 years now.
3433	1	a	A great game of skill, stragagy and car surfing! I highly recomend this game to anyone.
3435	1	a	7/10 Love the game i really do, but i am a pretty competitive player and the pvp, is pretty rageful. I mean you can expect a free to play game to also be pay to win, they gotta make money somehow and honestly i would rather the game be $20 then to have people with OP weapons killing you extremely fast. Im glad there is a bronze silver and gold ranked pvp system but there are still the players with better weapons. Now instead of complaining about the cons i would like to lastly say THE CUSTOMIZING of this game is seriously amazing.(the pvp brought the game to a 7/10)
3437	1	a	If you have money to spend great game. If you want a real free to play game then no.
3439	1	a	Action-packed, easy to learn (but hard to master), lots and lots of customization options (even without paying for anything). It's what an MMO shooter should be.
3441	1	a	This game is ok. I bought it back when Real Time Made it So Im still stuck on it as that time. I always hated game with a Weapon Rental system. That is the First thing gamers First Did to the game. This game Is Good if you like being mad cause It dont take long and it will put you there. There are unbalances and It has turned into more of a Pay to win type Game. So If you want to play for Pure Fun good luck and Dont get to upset.
3443	1	a	A great Third-Person Shooter that allows for full character, car, symbol, and theme customization. That's basically the only positive aspect of APBR.  Negative aspects include a multitude of hackers and exploiters which cause for people to rage easily. The game also includes trolls which like to drive dump truck into your vehicles. Open world districts allow people not a part of your current mission to grief you with what's called 'Ghosting'.  The game is full of bannable offenses but the company, GamersFirst, does nothing about it since their ban policy is based on user input. Users need to record and report a user for a person to be banned.  If you have a weak control of emotions then I would suggest not playing this game.
3445	1	a	Besides the weird lag spikes this game is great!
3447	1	a	It's a very amazing game, encourages you to try harder each time you finish a mission, but it's pretty annoying with the lag, the rendering issues, and the unbalanced weapons.
3449	1	a	An excellent third person shooter with tons of ability to customize your look and your vehicle. The game consists of two very large (1000+ meters) city maps where many teams of either faction are engaged in missions simultaneously. All in all a fantastic third person shooter that I spent hundreds of hours playing!  Pros - Full customization of vehicle and character with large multitudes of clothing and the ability to make completely custom designs. Every character and vehicle looks completely unique. - Large array of guns with custom skins, though most of the skins have to be bought through the in game store. - Progression system. If you like these, it's there. You get quick access to the base versions of guns, so it's not too bad. Though, things such as the OPGL and OSMAW come much later, as well as a couple of the cars. - Frequently matched against new people, so you're not playing against the same team over and over again like in other multiplayer shooters.  Cons - The open world can lead to griefing and 'ghosting' on occasion, or just some frustration as you're trying to drive to the next objective as quickly as you can while getting rammed by cars driven by other players. - Some of the guns in the in game store which cost real money to buy can be considered across the board better than some of the guns available as free to play.
3451	1	a	this freaking game won`t work on my computer 
3453	1	a	Really fun, more friends you play with the more fun this game can be.
3455	1	a	This game is BEAST
3457	1	a	If you can't afford GTA then you should really try APB Reloaded, an open world full of Criminals and Enforcers, steal cars or drive your own, go on missions and gain some money. It takes a little getting used to but it's fun once you get the hang of it. The customization is great, probably the best out of F2P games except, the hair styles. The graphics are good but you will need good specs to run it smoothly.
3459	1	a	I very much recommend this game to anyone really, it's a very fun game indeed and has a excellent player-base in my opinion. There may be a few bugs and lag issues but the fun content in the game makes up for al that. 5/5 stars!
3461	1	a	Even though this game can get to you it is still a fun game to play for hours. Anyone that has played it once can't stop.
3463	1	a	Yeah its good although its not my type of game although i love gta this just doesnt have it's charm. But you HAVE to try it out :P
3465	1	a	It's fun. So much. But it sucks, i told you.
3467	1	a	Simplistic and pay to win version of gta but free and potentially fun.
3469	1	a	really fun when working with people.
3471	1	a	The besty adreniline rushing game and addicting game ever played 
3473	1	a	it may seem boring at first but when you give the game a shot you will see that it gets better and better.
3475	1	a	&lt;3 love this game! Customization is freaking amazing, but matchmaking is kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up and there are a lot of hackers... 
3477	1	a	Best f2p game to play with friends
3479	1	a	I don't know about any of you but I enjoy the game. I haven't found it repetative like others say, but whatever. I would give it 7/10. Just like almost all games, I want to get that one thing and when I finally get it I don't want to play it anymore. So you wait a while and then the game gets fun again.  Describe this game in one word: Co-op
3481	1	a	This game is amazingly fun with lots of customization on your character and vehicles, although it can be limited unless you have premium (Subscription). Great third person shooter with a decent community and really loyal. Yeah it's a shooter but the driving around experience is pretty great also even though there are alot of jerks purposely ramming into you lol, but that's some of the fun. You should definately give this game a try.
3483	1	a	even tho their are hackers this game is great fun just to mess around on the phusics are comical i love this game
3485	1	a	Haters going to hate, people who gives this game a thumbs down have played this game for 1000hours and more lol. Game is fun, but many problems.
3487	1	a	I think they should make this Mac supported :) Its a really good game and would be even better if everyone had access
3489	1	a	punkbuster and pay to win
3491	1	a	Good Overal gameplay.
3493	1	a	fun but very pay to play
3495	1	a	ive played 98 minutes and still never played it.
3497	1	a	Great F2P   
3499	1	a	I honestly don't understand what people are complaining about- granted so far I've only clocked in 4 hours of gameplay in the two days that I've had it. Yeah, it's a bit glitchy, has a few hackers, and omg the car controls are so wonky I can hardly drive... but for what it is- it's a good game. You go around shooting people, making money, and unlocking content as you go to customize your character even more. Yeah, some things you have to pay for obviously the money is going into keeping the game up and running. And yes, it can get kind of boring after about 2-3 hours of consecutive gameplay without any friends.. but if you switch servers here and there (which can be tricky when the glitches decide to act up at this moment) and focus on getting your loot (so your character isn't boring as heck to look at).. you fill the time. If you actually talk to people you will see a lot of them are pretty decent and nice- not trolling asshats. With the reviews I've read around various sites, I was expecting everyone to be on my case because I'm new. I was expecting total disregard for teams. I was expecting huge trolls and hackers sitting around waiting for a guy like me to come around. Not the case. Besides, what are you expecting from a game that you play online, objective to kill, and it's free? I totally recommend the game to anyone looking to have some fun. It's pretty casual for the most part. You can even just stand around and talk if you feel like it. Rating: 7.5(almost an 8)/10.
3501	1	a	Surprisingly fun.
3503	1	a	Like Saints Row, only with thousands of bugs, 500ms lag and a 100% Brazilian fanbase!
3505	1	a	Would be an AMAZING game if there were no hackers.
3507	1	a	i have been playing this game since it was not on steam, i like the game because of the customization of everything you have, car your person and guns. some people say that this game is pretty pay 2 win, whihc yes i can see that you can pay money to buy op guns, but alot of games are like that, so really it just up to personal prefrence
3509	1	a	11/10 would bang
3511	1	a	Take Grand Theft Auto V. Take 20 - 30% of the features out. Make it slightly more complicated. And BOOM! You've just made APB Reloaded.
3513	1	a	Spent a little bit of time in this game, and there's a good amount of in game purchases (what did you expect, it's a free game) but I still enjoyed and will continue to enjoy this game. I would recommend it.
3515	1	a	Pretty fun..more like GTA. Play a cop or a crimminal in teams with objectives. The only downside to this game is that its Free to Play and the players have made the game 'unplayable'. Way to much cheating and just rude players. Not worth it, but it was fun for a few minutes.
3517	1	a	APB capitalizes on customization, great built-in design tools with lots of stuff to unlock and lots of skimpy non-clothing available for your female avatar's unproportionate â™¥â™¥â™¥. Even though unsubscribed players are limited in how many design elements they can have on each peice of clothing or each vehicle, it still feels functional and fun. Hanging around the social district and seeing the hilariously creative outfits that players design is the most entertaining part of APB. Giving myself a back tattoo that said 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ASS' for all to see provided me with deep satisfaction.  Although the matchmaking and missions are fluid, innovative and fun, the sub-par combat and driving mechanics don't provide a sturdy foundation for all of this glorious and limitless customization to stand on, and it is reflected by its ever-crumbling playerbase.   Play long enough and your 'threat' level increases, putting you at a different matchmaking level to keep games fair and balanced, while at the same time isolating you from an exponentially larger part of the player pool with each rise in threat level. Before long I had reached the highest threat level, and was rewarded with a whopping 2 possible opponents that were currently online to play against. Nice. The most proposed solutions to lowering your threat level to again have fun with the game are to 'lose on purpose' or 'create a new character'... What? Seriously?  I'd like to see customization like this in the next stab at an online GTA-style open world game. APB definitely layed the groundwork for a matchmaking method that keeps everyone in the same world while simultaneously pitting groups of players against eachother. You'll often see fights between other teams going on right next to you.   Cool game overall, although the most fun to be had is in the customization menus and not in playing the game itself.  
3519	1	a	A decent game imo to have fun with your friends :), try it out and see!.
3521	1	a	Pros: Great game within it self. Has alot of features that just wants you to keep playing!  Cons: You mite find a hacker or two.
3523	1	a	You can be an 80's cop and shoot people with an LMG.  10/10
3525	1	a	Its a bigass download, but if its the same as it was a year ago imma play the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game XD
3527	1	a	Nice looking game. Gameplay is intertaining but no enough. Too much pay to win. 5/10
3529	1	a	great for when you want a cause of suicide!
3531	1	a	lots of fun
3533	1	a	LOVE THIS GAME! I love to take my rage out on random people.
3535	1	a	Really fun to play once you get into it, easy controls, lots of customization :)
3537	1	a	Screwin around is awesome
3539	1	a	OK Game. The graphics are alright, and you have a fun experience.
3541	1	a	This game is fab. Better than all Grand Theft Autos!
3543	1	a	Oh yes I recommend this. This is a really good game other than some P2W stuff.
3545	1	a	I like the game but it has a lot of bug that needed to be fixed!
3547	1	a	A lot of the combat can be extremely one sided sometimes, especially with a group of friends who know what they are doing, and have ranks in the 200's. BUT, What keeps this positive for me is how fun it can be to just mess around and troll people, as well as the customization. I can't give the most detailed review, if you want that, look at all of the others.
3549	1	a	this is a great game,but i think u should have a X64 computer to run it well,because it needs 4GB RAM at least
3551	1	a	Summary: In APB Reloaded you take on the role of a Criminal - hell-bent on causing havoc and making money, or an Enforcer - tapped by the city to keep order. The city never sleeps and the fight never ends in this fast paced Massively Multi-player, Action Shooter! 
3553	1	a	He was a cop, and good at his job. But then he committed the ultimate sin and testified against other cops - gone bad. Cops who tried to kill him, but got the woman he loved instead. Framed for murder, now he prowls the badlands. An outlaw hunting outlaws, a bounty hunter - an Enforcer! \nn/
3555	1	a	Want the most fun out of your f2p experience? PLay a criminal and don't do missions. You'll make plenty of money and not have to worry about level 1's with a '+10 Sniper Rifle of Colon Obliteration'. Plus hey, you can beat up civies and drive a fedex truck. Wat's not to like?
3557	1	a	No cheaers at all. Best GM keep game clean. Very gut for new players learning to play...
3559	1	a	damm it if you dont have this download it its free but kind of pay 2 win 
3561	1	a	Great game if your a fan of GTA series.
3563	1	a	APB:Reloaded is a great game. It has one of the most massive customization abilities in F2P history. Everyone can be as unique as they so care. Not many hackers, easy to learn to play as well. The game features a fairly large car amount to have what car you would like. Same goes with clothing accessories. However, the game is mostly pay-to-win. You need to spend real money on silly things like a 30 day SMG. Or if you accually want to make a cool/complex customization creation, you need premium to do anything. And the game is good, but hard to play without the best graphics card available. It crashs about 3 hours in so this is not the game for casual players or hardcore players. The game still features great cars, good guns, a wide veriety of contacts so you can rank up and get new guns and cars as well as clothing items. After all the things i've just written, this game still gets a thumbs up, because all those pay-to-win type of things its alot of work to keep servers up and to make this a graphicly good contender to other F2P. It still needs alot of work, but as long as you stick around you will see how much the game can be, and will be improved. With 450+ hours, I approve this message.
3565	1	a	Pretty good game except for the fact that it kills my pc just trying to run it.
3567	1	a	This game is a real challenge if you play alone, there is alot of players that are really good. Few months ago there was a raid to kick out all the hackers when they get reported and that made the game playable again. Irocammand tha game if you have few friends to play with you in a 3 or 4 player squad if you start. There is NO limits in customization of your clothes to your cars, so your oponnents will reconnize you if your start to be a threat :P. I hope this was helpful, good game!
3569	1	a	Best game. When you really get down to it and ignore some of the connection problems that happen sometimes because of new updates and really understand the game and what to do. (Winning helps) It's really a great game. Tip: If ur a silver or a bronze unless you like challenges never join silver or gold servers, Bronze is where it's best at.
3571	1	a	Awful game. Not enough ntec reskins.
3573	1	a	This game is fun but occasionally you get people that rage which is fine couse well... they mad.
3575	1	a	GET IT OF U LUV GTA 
3577	1	a	GTA mixed into a mmo, its a fun game to play with alot of other people, there is some down sides, they could use more maps after a while it gets little boring with only 2 maps... but the upside is if you feel like running over people shooting everyting and even blowing up cars, chasing cops or cops chasing chrims this is a great mmo ITs FTP so no money will really need to be spent unless you want to!
3579	1	a	great game to do with a bunch of friends, love the customization abilities :)
3581	1	a	- Pay2Win -Not optimizzed -Low data reading -Cheaters (hacks AIM) -Enjoi
3583	1	a	Played...  Died...  Spent Money...  Couldn't stop even when things got bad...  Things got better...  Became a 'somebody as one of the trailers suggests...  Spent more money...  Satisifed with the 600 dollars spent on this game and the endless customisation.
3585	1	a	Alright as far as i see APB Reloaded its a really fun game...the only thing I think everyone who wants to play this game should know before they join is that there is going to be a lot of haters and people who get mad easily, all I suggest for this really is to ignore them and continue on playing because games are meant to be fun not stress alright...that's just my opinion. :3
3587	1	a	A mix between CS, GTA and Barbie (what other game lets you design your own clothes, including hand-made decals?).  Good stuff, though it's completely unfriendly to casuals.
3589	1	a	love this game!
3591	1	a	This is a great game to play. It is an urban 3rd person shooter game that is an MMO Co-Op version Grand Theft Auto. It has a MMO RPG like system built into the game with progression, levels trading, ect. Tons of customizations to cars, clothing, weapons and charactors. The only issues with the game though are the expensive items and upgrades. Maintaining a lease on the weapons gets very expensive for pure free to play players. I highly reccommend that serious players go pay to play and get a perma weapon and side arm they always use. Also, the general community is poor and very trollish. If you can ignore the bad sides and stick to a good team of friends, it will be a fun game for you to play.
3593	1	a	I just came here to read the comments :o ***
3595	1	a	It's free, so why don't try it.
3597	1	a	This game really deserves more players, it's good hyper-blasting cop-killing, crime stopping fun.  there are flaws but it's still great fun with friends  8/10
3599	1	a	This game is great. You can have a criminal character or an enforcer character, and engage in PvP combat with other players by starting missions within the game. It is PvP based however, so if you aren't into PvP, I wouldn't recommend this game for you, for there are no bots to kill aside from the civilians. There are open-world crimes that criminals can commit and enforcers can witness, or there are official missions with objectives, which yield higher rewards and almost always throw you into a PvP situation, unless you happen to be one of the only people in the district. Some open-world crimes you can commit as a criminal are mugging and ram-raiding. Overall this is a great game for people looking for a Grand Theft Auto type of game for free, though this isn't too much like Grand Theft Auto, honestly.  My Ratings PvP - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… PvE - â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† Customization - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… Driving - â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜† Open-world crimes - â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜† Missions - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† Weapons - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† Community - â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†  Overall - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
3601	1	a	A much better game with huge customization. Recommended!
3603	1	a	Best game since pong.
3605	1	a	I broke into a garage, shot innocent people while running down the street, ran from the cops, and then fell off a building and lost everything. Also I did all this in my underwear.  10/10
3607	1	a	Highly detailed character creator. Go to advanced and play around - possibilities are almost endless.  GTA-like gameplay, improved by competitiveness (your mission is opposed by members of the other faction). The pay for better items (which are ridiculously expensive with in-game currency) will leave you at teh mercy of others as a froob though (free playing noob).
3609	1	a	11/10-ign 2 little freddys 2 mennu hekers -spooderman   You should play this game. One of the best F2PTPS(Free2PlayThirdPersonShooter) 
3611	1	a	fun, good customization, pleanty of cars, lots of clothing,customization scrolls, etc.
3613	1	a	APB Reloaded is an alright game.. it feels kinda like GTA's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cousin. Its biggest problems is pay-2-win and matchmaking. 6/10
3615	1	a	Very addicting, even if it's a bit repetitive. Admittedly it's hard to progress without premium once you get to a certain point, and a lot of the premium weapons are overpowered, but not to the point where you NEED them to do well. Admittedly, I haven't played in over a year, so this may have changed.
3617	1	a	Fun to play with friends, but there's loads of hackers.
3619	1	a	Awesome for a Free game but you do often get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by ads to upgrade... but here's a little known secret APB actually stand for Angry Pensioner â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es. Plus much arousal can be gained from breast modification.
3621	1	a	Pretty fun game, slightly repetitive, very microtransaction-based... But still pretty good quality for a FTP game.
3623	1	a	game is great alternertive to other action games like gta 5 but the problem i hate the most is the lag n to op weapons
3625	1	a	This are the nicest game and i dont can stop play it
3627	1	a	Free to play. Guns. Need I say more?
3629	1	a	Run around in a pair of briefs and a tie while cops yell at you to do something criminal.  10/10
3631	1	a	Propanity. 10/10
3633	1	a	The game is realy nice i love it :3
3635	1	a	Good Game Horrible Community
3637	1	a	Combine Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row 3 add some MMORPG and free to play marketing system and you have this.
3639	1	a	I love this game so much even there's 2many hacker lol but dose shootin like 360 mlg no scope headshot is the best thin I eva done in dis game. some player'z are a camper that camp around store waiting for criminal to Ram the store and get rekt lol. but ani wayz I totally lov dis game sooooooooooooooooooo 1000000000000 ducks / 10 ducks
3641	1	a	Absolutely SIK M8
3643	1	a	A nice F2P and MMOTPS to play, check it out.
3645	1	a	download apb 2 pls
3647	1	a	its good
3649	1	a	One of the best, if not THE best free to play MMO out there, i enjoy this game A LOT.  I hear from a lot of people that this game is 'pay to win', you can't do good without paying... this is however wrong! you can do great at this game without paying a single dime, the first gun you start out with for example, is one of the best guns in the game, while not great in close quarters, it is awesome at medium range. All of the guns in the game has some weaknesses, find the weakness and USE IT!  You go out and do missions and after a while you get up to 100k-200k money, you can get a great car form the marketplace, the money takes some time to farm up, but it you don't spend it all on clothes or whatever it goes pretty fast.  this is a truly great game, for what it is.
3651	1	a	it more like a cop and robbers type game 
3653	1	a	This game is awesome fun to play can be easy and can be hard i reomend this game for 13+
3655	1	a	Me and my one friend were driving after this package in the enemy's car and there was a guy on to of the car who had a rocket launcher and blew us up.  69/10
3657	1	a	play this game
3659	1	a	Fun, free, and easy to play.
3661	1	a	This game is quite a very fun game with awesome groups,weapons,vehicles and more! 9.5/10
3663	1	a	Did you like cops vs. robbers as a kid? Do you like games where there's no well-defined 'good' guy? Do you like the GTA games? Do you like Saints Row games? (no air or water vehicles, and no motorcycles) Do you like semi-controlled world PvP? Do you like team play? Do you like team battlefields? Do you like weapons, vehicle, and character customization? Do you like skulking around solo causing mischief? Do you like ramming into unsuspecting vehicles with a dump truck and watching them expand into a cloud of incandescent vapor?  APB may have what you're looking for. ^.^
3665	1	a	it like gta but only online 
3667	1	a	If you like to rage allot, here you go :)
3669	1	a	i dislike that when loaded the game doenst show it self full screen and i cant open it but still plays and i cant control it
3671	1	a	highley recommended even though my pc sucks at 1.9 GHz and a 256 MB graphics card i can still play with tons of lag and i love the game but please make a patch so it dont lag for me no more it gets annoying!
3673	1	a	WTF happed? 
3675	1	a	Love the limitless customization. But the community is not really good due idling the newbie. No pay to win, In-game weapon still can killng the enemy. But the only problem is when the higher rank player get a better gear and shooting you all time.
3677	1	a	First of all, for those who decide to play without a Premium subscription, the game is unforgiving and quite frankly, very frustrating. Every part of the game screams Pay-To-Win with unfair matchups, overpowered weapons, overpowered abilities, overpowered verhicles, high prices for items and so on. Many fights often end up being a question of 'who payed for what' and not 'who has the better skill', which is a real shame, because the the game itself is actually really fun. Everything is extremely customizable. From characters to cars to clothing. You'll never see the same character design twice. Also with activities such as robbing stores, jacking cars, muggin people etc., you can experience the life of the little Gangster you always wanted to be.  In short, for people who like GTA San Andreas-type of games, APB is a blast. Best played with friends and with a Premium subscription. If you don't want to pay or don't have the patience, quickly forget about this game, because it will make you go mad. Trust me.
3679	1	a	Really fun game, you can play with friends and customize your clothing/Cars.
3681	1	a	When APB first came out it was a fun and interesting Idea, many many balance problems but the future looked bright, that was until 3 weeks after the game was released it was shutdown due to 0 cash and 0 cash means no company means no servers. Eventually G1 picked it up and relaunched it with some minor tweaks and all was good except no compensation for players who previously bought the game. History aside now lets get into it, this will be fairly short.  Gameplay is alright, G1 surprisingly continued to develope the game and not just let it be a cash grab completely. The rework to the economy where you rent guns rather than buy sucks, a lot. the poor hacker prevention is terrible but hackers dont run to terribly rampant and low skill players wont run into them hardly at all. All in all its interesting, with a fairly par shooting mechanic, and a nice amount of customisation for the free player and a lot for the subscriber. I never feel like I have to subscribe even though I have on a few special occasion when I play for more than a month at a time. Something about it keeps pulling me back time and time again, sometimes just a few days, or a month. but just like EVE online for me I just cant quit it for long. (although in APB I'm not blacklisted by multiple corps for abandoment and possible spy ect ect.)  overall. 6/10 a good fun time but come expecting that you are gonna spend possibly 20 minutes at a time just being bent over and taking it from all sides while you can do nothing but throw your body on an objective praying that you dont get turned to tiny gibs of goo and being reminded that you got pwnd by all sorts of catchy or horribly annoying theme songs.
3683	1	a	Outstanding!  -RiotJones July 20, 2012
3685	1	a	a lot of lag, but a great game~
3687	1	a	Nice shot!
3689	1	a	Its epic 
3691	1	a	They've apparently quit with the Pay 2 Win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so it's become a fun game again
3693	1	a	Im making my way downtown.....*gets rammed by a freindly car*....friend enters cars and says:' Why dont you go?'....and i just look at my totaled car and say:'Get the F*** out of my mother f****** face you fake police officer'....and then we get blown up by a criminal....the vicious cycle of APB!
3695	1	a	love this game just wnat a pvp server so you can free roam and kill at same time
3697	1	a	It's OK
3699	1	a	The game is great and i love to play it
3701	1	a	its good but matchmaking is a bit bad :/
3703	1	a	i love this game but since my old computer was bad i did not play it that much because it was laggy but it was amazing 
3705	1	a	Cool concept. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dick game. One of the worst allowed on steam.
3707	1	a	apb reloaded part 1 
3709	1	a	Great game to play and have fun with friends. Downsides I think are really BIG problems: take ages to get characters looking good, get weapons that are awesome and to get good vehicles. Plus if you don't play for ages then suddenly come back on things usually go missing from your account; like vehicles or clothing. But all in all, a really fun game.
3711	1	a	this games is so amzing it is da best game ever i love it
3713	1	a	Cool 
3715	1	a	One of the best games ever made !! 
3717	1	a	This place is BAWLIN' yo. G's be pimpan like you never SEEN. I seen one and I was like 'WHAAAAT! Are you serious APB?' Mean girls workin the banks, tho. This one chick wouldn't even let me holla. I was like 'Please, you poor anyway.'
3719	1	a	one of the best games ive played on steam 
3721	1	a	Its like GTA with a few differences but its fun as hell... If you can get it to work
3723	1	a	really good for customizing but badly needs a ranking system and a better ant-cheat softwave
3725	1	a	APB is one of the best game youll ever play .. OMG the designs the symbols the guns are too awesome But:  if your under age do not try it because you get banned  if you wana cheat or aimbot or macro ( any form of cheat ) then dont bother fair fight will ban you  Its the best game ever but you have to be the right person for the right game  Thank you G1 for this awesome game
3727	1	a	The game is really fun when played alone and with friends. Played the game for some time and really liked it. I recommend it to all fans of TPS games.
3729	1	a	I liked APB.. but didn't continue after a couple of plays.. simply becuase it lacked controller support. There were a few features I would have liked to have seen also.. radio stations, more solid single quest modes and not just MP, because if your just starting, single quests is where you learn your tools to play the mp. a more detailed customisation of char. but I havent played in around 2 years so maybe they have these features now.. if your Kb&amp;M and stuck for cash, it's F2P.. worth a tryout, if you don't like then no harm done.
3731	1	a	Multiplayer Cops and Robbers styled game.  Whether you be a Enforcer of the City Security Act or a Criminal out causing havok, this game is quite good if you're into Team Deathmatch and 'Capture the Flag' style games.   You have the ability to customize your character and your vehicle which can drive around one of the many districts available with players always on. From there you can accept missions and be placed against other players or even go solo.  The game is different from most team servers, where games set you up with people you don't know, randomly, etc. APB is different, it encourages you to make a team even providing in-game voice chat.  The only cons about the game I have is it quite laggy at times (at least for me), due to the fact the servers are not Austrlian based. The lag is hardly noticable unless you're in a vehicle due to the poor response times it has. Another thing is the hackers which are on the game and you have to purchase premium which gets you points quicker.
3733	1	a	Nice Game , i play this , and is very awesome with friend , (coop) 
3735	1	a	It is great for free roaming with friends but anything outside of that is pure pay to win and is not recommended.
3737	1	a	This is the greatest pvp mmo ever.  Best customization of all time, you can be anything or anyone. Community is quite horrible but also hilarious, think barrens chat in vanilla wow. Great for casual players who want to shoot up other players and blow up cars. You need a lot of practice to get good at all the different weapons and you need to put in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tonne of hours to level up and unlock weapons like osmaw (rocket launcher). When you finally get a grasp of what to do it offers the best pvp experience ever, but be warned players who are grouped up in clans are very difficult to beat which offers a lot of challenge. Ive been playing for over 1 year now and it still offers challenges and difficulties because your always playing against other players who are very experienced. For new players they have a tutorial which is very easy to understand but also lets you join in the game immediately and play with others.
3739	1	a	Clocking in 1k hours in this game really makes me see how much i love it. It's been a while now since i played because once you reach the top levels the progress is a bit slow and the updates takes a long time to come out.  The new anti-cheat system really have cleaned up the game and the name-shaming in the chat is not nearly as bad as before which makes the game more fun and nice to spend time in.  Make sure you get some friends in Skype/Teamspeak or similar and play together, that is how the game should be played.  I am definatly returning to the game when the Unreal Engine 3.5 update rolls out!
3741	1	a	Grand Theft Auto For PC
3743	1	a	Laggy, wow they need to fix that. The only thing I like about this game is the customization is fun!
3745	1	a	If you've ever wished Saints Row had more of a multiplayer focus, this game is for you. It's like the devs took everything we loved about the open world genre - the vehicles, the combat, the costumes, the weapons - and turned it into an mmo. This game is fun to play solo, but with 3 friends and a mic connection it is the closest thing to the perfect mmo you will find this decade. There is nothing more fun than driving a car with 3 of your mates hanging out the windows shooting everything that moves.  With an incredibly detailed world, fully customizable outfits and cars, a dynamic mission system, and a huge variety of weapons, this game is a PVP'ers dream come true. It's got a level of polish and attention to detail that other free to play mmo's lack.   NOTE: If you want the best latency, join the Han Server in Hong Kong. The average ping is about 120 - 150, which makes a nice change from having to connect to US servers on the other side of the world.
3747	1	a	APB: Reloaded has one of the coolest premises ever. Cops and Crooks, simple right? It is.  OVERVIEW  The game takes place inb San Paro, a city with crime unparalel to anything else. So much so that the City Security Act (CSA) was passed. Allowing any citizen to walk the streets with a liscense to practice Vigilantism.    When you start the game you make your biggest decision, Do I want to be a good guy or a bad guy? Once you make your decision, you get to make a character with a very good, high detailed creator.   STARTING OUT   Once your character is situated, you're basically set free, the tutorial system is very poor. In the city you'll simply be dispatched to start or stop crimes. The game usually does a great job to match you with even teams.  CUSTOMIZATION   The game does although have great customization. Most clothes in the game are relatively cheap, so if you have the time, you can have an awesome character. Same with vehicles, customization is a big deal in this game.   The game allows you to create custom symbols as well. To paste onto your clothes and cars.  COMABT  There's lots of variables in combat. Combat can either be very fast and fun. or slow and boring. It all depends on the players, and enviroment.   The game kinda influences camping, with lots of defense objectives simply being, guard this choke point on this conveinient rooftop.  DRIVING   Ugh, driving is a mess. There's always a delay, you'll press 'd' to steer right. Then after half a second to three seconds later your character will steer the car. This cuases very awkward and slippery driving.  FINAL VERDICT   APB: Reloaded is a fun hectic expirience, especially with friends. But poor tutorials and slippery driving kind of ruin it.   ~ 7/10 Worth Trying.
3749	1	a	Pay2win. It's kinda fun despite that, though this is terribly optimized. Play it only if your computer is &lt;2 yr old.
3751	1	a	Really love the game. :)) 10/10 :))
3753	1	a	One of the best 3rd person arcade shooters out there.  Loaded with customization options, some may suggest it's P2W, but the game is largely skill based. General car controls are a bit iffy, but are manageable. Character controls are responsive.  Community is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and look down upon newcomers, the developers are slow. And the game likes to chew up to 4 or 5 GB of your RAM.  Despite all of it's issues, it's a solid game, and deserves a go, it's one of a kind game.
3755	1	a	Gimme that punk! &lt;3
3757	1	a	nice graphics its like GTA ONLINE but for free
3759	1	a	Steal stuff from stores, kill Enforcers, Get some nice weapon and start fight against the law!
3761	1	a	game is pretty cool
3763	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
3765	1	a	THIS...IS...AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST FPS/ Free to play EVER!!
3767	1	a	Love this game. It's a nice twist on cops and robbers. The addition to being able to arrest criminals is awesome IMHO. If you're looking for a good Cops vs Robers kidna game this is it.   The only con I have with this game is that at times it will freeze and force you to restart your computer unless you disable all but one audio device.
3769	1	a	Really the best F2P game i've ever played!
3771	1	a	Be who you can't be.
3773	1	a	Very well made game and also can be extremely addictive,there will be a little lag now and then but its acceptable and not to bad
3775	1	a	There has to be 10,000+ more things to do. I started a long time ago and still havent finished, Customize Vehicles and yourself, You can pick 1 side, theres 2, Thug or Police Choose your fate, grab your gun.
3777	1	a	'The best part of this game is not just the shooting and guarding the objective.' The best part of this game is that god gaben made the uninstall button as bright as the game and easy to find than finding a bloody opponent    see the 2.2 hour i wasted on that game? it takes that long to be diagnosed with brain cancer   
3779	1	a	best game its free and its for windows
3781	1	a	Can't even believe I'm installing this again...
3783	1	a	i had lots of Fun in APB and i still have
3785	1	a	Enjoy a little mayhem every once in a while? This is the game for you then... watch out for the piggies though.
3787	1	a	Has more crying kids then Call of Duty eventhough is has less players 10/10
3789	1	a	greatest free to play forerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
3791	1	a	Absolutely addicting! A must have game or at least a must try! If you are into the Grand Theft Auto series or the cops and robbers genre? Then, APB Reloaded will keep you busy for hours on end! Lots to do and complete character customization. Leveling up your gun role progression is what makes this game one of a kind!!!! Very unique and original MMO 3rd person shooting game!   aka Badnuz (Colby)
3793	1	a	BEST GAME!
3795	1	a	Best game i've seen that lets you choose whether to be a criminal or a enforcer. Its not pay to win, i myself use the starter gun and i get my share of kills. 8/10
3797	1	a	Its like cops and robbers ! accept better!
3799	1	a	Alright, I'll say it right off, if you want something to just pick up and play and be great at it, this is not for you. It takes practice. Skill can overcome almost anything in this game (Except the serious problem with hackers) If you invest money in it, it can be fantastic, though I have not yet spent a dime on it. Going into this game remember to keep a cool head and communicate with your team, also remember it is a GAME meaning it is here to have fun. So have fun. I personally consider it a canvas. The customization in this game is addictive and delicious. It takes a serious grind to get everything, and I doubt I'll ever make it, but being able to customize to this degree, I think it's well worth while. Plus, who doesn't like killing cops while blasting Hollywood Undead out of your car speakers? Or blasting Five Finger Death Punch's 'Mama's said knock you out' while mopping the floors with some criminals? Either way, the customization is there, and if you like games but never feel like you play as yourself, or the character you want to be, or maybe you're just settling or picking a favorite, in any case, if you want to express yourself, this is for you. If you're reading this recently after I posted you can see my steam profile pic is indeed a modified screenshot from the game. Start it up, guys, be patient and try your best.
3801	1	a	I'm McLovin this games ! Once. Been a long while since I login. Gettin n00b. I will be back. Much customization in games and fun gameplay. One of the best customize I ever encounter. Need a good teamwork or frens to truly enjoy the games though.
3803	1	a	Criminals VS Enforcers the only thing missing is being able to rob banks with your buddies or put down criminals with them.
3805	1	a	
3807	1	a	Me: 'What's that sound?'  Brian: 'I didn't tell You? This is the Talavan.'  Brian: 'Talavan? Wait, why did you get ou-' BOOM (Assorted laughter) Me: 'F*** You, Brian.'
3809	1	a	Ok its like GTA but mass multi with many customisation and a load of fun and gunfire. still a bit unfair because the Punkbuster seem to dont have any effect on cheaters and hackers, but i hope theyll fix it some time. i give it a 7.6 out of 10 Ragdolls.
3811	1	a	Saw butts on a sign and uninstalled.
3813	1	a	After a long break I've returned for more blood. It's a bad day to be an enforcer. :)
3815	1	a	Great game, near limitless possibilities for customization, a lot of potential, skill based shooting system, customized cars, clothes, songs, blasting pokemon random encounter music every time I kill someone... Greatness &lt;3
3817	1	a	I recommend this game to a rather limited crowd, for a couple of reasons.  _Pros_  Customisation. Probably the best I've ever seen in a game, better than Saints Row, better than the Bethesda games for character customisation. You can make your character look like pretty much anyone you choose to, let alone the great symbol customiser and car customisation is brilliant. Except the lack of non-purchased car parts, GamersFirst loves the moneys.  _Cons_  Level design is attorcious, you can lock down an entire mission for an opposing team by camping in a completely unreachable spot. San Paro is plagued by badly designed, unconquerable locations, which players can move the objective too, and will make people mash their head on the keyboard, and hang themselves on power leads with fustration. - For example, there's a mission where you have to defend a briefcase, and a team put it on a ledge, which no-one could get to as it was so over-exposed that they could be shot from 360Â° Horrific.  Repitition. Gaaaah, this game is full of it. Most of the missions repeat themselves over and over again, the same mission, but in slightly different locations. This is fine for the first 10 hours, but after that you're seeing same old, same old over and over again. Nothing really changes as you sit there enduring the couple of minute wait between missions.  Community. It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, packed with hackers, and accusations of being a hacker. You'll rarely meet someone who's actually friendly, just people that are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off by you being utterly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and decreasing their status from Gold to Silver.  _Conclusion_  It's good for people that love customisation and shooting at things and driving, and that's pretty much it. I just happen to be one of that few that doesn't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the cons.
3819	1	a	This is probably one of the best F2P games ive ever seen or played. Just the graphics and customization alone are jawdroping.The game base of crims vs cops is something somewhat new at this level.     Very lovely game ,  keep up the good work!!
3821	1	a	think third person fps with small teams against one another. good for a free to play but does have a pay to win setup TONS of customization. 8/10 in my book 
3823	1	a	its great:D hard to grasp at first though
3825	1	a	I dont know why everyone is so mad. I mean, there are a lot of people that hack, a lot of things you can buy for real money, BUT the game is still really fun. (If you can, bring a friend, it only makes the game very much better)
3827	1	a	February 9, 2013. Best guide for this game.        (23rd January 2015 update) APB:R WEAPON GUIDE, TIPS, AND HOW TO AVOID NEWBIE TRAPS&nbsp;
3829	1	a	it deos take a long time to download but after you have tryed clicking play and all the other bits and bobs of clicking then it might work or it might not but saying all of this i would recommend this game because when you get the game starter the graphics are nt bad but the only things that dissapoint me is that it takes a while to start when you first get it and the game is quiet confusing for example how to change your outfit or how to upgrade on certain stuff like a gun or a car it is quiet hard but you do get a tutorial and when you drive car it is quiet glichy that might just be me im not sure but over all i would recommend this game  soz for quiet alot of negitive comments apb reloaded but i have to write a review on what i think
3831	1	a	This Game Is only fun with friends but if you are anti social and want to play a dumbed down GTA clone with other people this game is perfect for you
3833	1	a	Such A good game obviously it is better with DLC but good game and its the only style of game for free
3835	1	a	people may say it gta but it is not one of the best game to play with your friends
3837	1	a	APB is a very fun place to play, fast cars, guns, and a cops vs theif none stop, gotta watch your back, Played this alot, will play more, been busy lately but look forward to the return of my cars!, I love making awesome cars for you guys!
3839	1	a	It is like the best game 
3841	1	a	this game is awsome
3843	1	a	Amazing game!! A must play for pc gamers.
3845	1	a	Other than the fact that Gold Rated Districts and Players are either hackers or gods, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome game with intense ammounts of creative freedom, also get ready for the pervs, there are lots.
3847	1	a	I do recommend this game to all of you but i enden up playing it so much that i got banned, I was really good at the game and i would never intend to hack. But i only lost about 200 dollars and g1 gave me no refound so its okay i guess. Go ahead and try it the chance of being banned for not doing anything is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing tiny i have 10 alternative accounts :D
3849	1	a	Customizations are similar (in the aspect of making your character) if not better than the Saints Row series. You can create unlimited customizations when it comes to clothing, decals for your vehicles, how you dress, etc. This game really brings out the inner-self and really allows you to express yourself through a video game. You can create 8-bit songs that are used for your theme when you kill a player, thus they can hear that little song every time they die from you.  You can also add mods to your guns and to yourself. This helps you by killing the opposition that much quickly. The combat is fun and fluid â€“ very fast, aggressive, and determined to finish off your opponent in a timely manner by any means necessary (e.g. sniper, grenades, rocket launcher, running them down via vehicle, etc.). The game is like GTA/SR having a child with a MMO. The game is rather big and has numerous districts all which have their own quests and purpose that pertains to each district.   There is a social district where you can go to buy stuff from the local auction house, customize your own gear, socialize with other members of APB, and chillax after a few rounds of fast, paced gameplay.
3851	1	a	Great free 3rd person shooter. Community isn't the best in my opinion, but still tons of fun, especially with friends!
3853	1	a	Got killed within 30 seconds of actual gameplay. 10/10
3855	1	a	The games lost its charm, but I still play it! why do i love this game so much?!
3857	1	a	i watch some videos about this and i thought it was really good but i will have to play it first
3859	1	a	Not BAd
3861	1	a	
3863	1	a	Very fun and i love the carachter costumization :D better thatn sims
3865	1	a	this is a cool game 
3867	1	a	i reccomend this game if you are going to play with a group of 2 or more, if i had to point out a negative about this game it is that it takes abit of time to launch so if yours doesnt open up instantly give it sometime,
3869	1	a	The game is pretty good but theres some things that affects the gameplay -the pshyhics are insane -car steering is hard -if you want new weapons you need to buy them with real money -there are so much hackers -this is not for everyone but my game crashes my pc after i play 10 minutes 
3871	1	a	Im like this game
3873	1	a	cool 
3875	1	a	Mediocre, through and through. An good try but F2P limits its potential.
3877	1	a	Fun game when you have nothing else to do. 7/10
3879	1	a	I got killed by jumping off a 1 story building  10/10
3881	1	a	One of my all time favorite games. Too many hours have been spent playing it. Lots of customization with generic TPS combat.
3883	1	a	best game ever but no one play mission anymore
3885	1	a	Good game but I got kicked for getting 5 headshots in a row (?)  Nearly every player is a noob.
3887	1	a	VERY good customization, anything from clothes to cars to your own EYES can be customized almost infinitely! Gameplay is solid, has very good shooting mechanics and the misson system is just to die for, however the car driving seems to lag for me, (probably my crappy internet), but it is still a very engrossing game, i played 8 hours last night, all in all 9/10, i reduced the score by one since latency issues are a bit to severe even for people with good internet.
3889	1	a	this game is a waste of your life. BUT..... it is a very good waste of your life when you get in to the game
3891	1	a	NOTE: I have over 400 or so hours logged in this game on another launcher previous to me joining steam.  I will not recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a fair fight. I will not recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a friendly player-base. I will not recommend this game to anyone who wants to fight simple AI without challenge. I will not recommend this game to anyone who does not have a lot of spare time. I will not recommend this game to anyone who cannot deal with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t GMs or Devs I will not recommend this game to anyone who has an anger problem.  I WILL recommend this game to any and ALL video-game masochists and sadists alike!  Pros +GREAT Customization +There ARE 'good' players here. +This game does NOT hold your hand.  Cons -Old players are mostly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-heads. -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Dev Team -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GMs -Could do with less 'cash pay' bull-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. -Needs a genuine player base -Stop catering to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.  Thank you for your time in reading, this game really had some serious potential! It was marketed properly, it played very well when I was in, but now the reviews I see are far beyond disappointing. Clean up your act APB, you're like the boxer a child roots for until he crashes his car into a school bus full of gifted and talented children.
3893	1	a	Meh, nice. It has the formula for a P2W game and getting items and the tutorial tasks is hard and making a decal and customising anything is far to limited. Cars and guns are good though. Love playing as my Enforcer mainly because I have done more progress on that one and im still debating whether my Criminal profile should be male or female. Plus, as both a pro and con, there are items that look awesome but are restricted which is annoying like good cars, guns and epic looking clothing and skills. Thumbs up but needs more cheap weapons and everything needs to be constantly availiable with the really epic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ needing contracts.
3895	1	a	My friend wants me to play it but I dont want to because of high ping :3 8/10
3897	1	a	A Good GTA Clone
3899	1	a	A good concept with poor execution worth it to check it out just to see what it could have been like.
3901	1	a	Love the limitless customization. But the community is not really good due idling the newbie. No pay to win, In-game weapon still can killng the enemy. But the only problem is when the higher rank player get a better gear and shooting you all time.
3903	1	a	First of all, for those who decide to play without a Premium subscription, the game is unforgiving and quite frankly, very frustrating. Every part of the game screams Pay-To-Win with unfair matchups, overpowered weapons, overpowered abilities, overpowered verhicles, high prices for items and so on. Many fights often end up being a question of 'who payed for what' and not 'who has the better skill', which is a real shame, because the the game itself is actually really fun. Everything is extremely customizable. From characters to cars to clothing. You'll never see the same character design twice. Also with activities such as robbing stores, jacking cars, muggin people etc., you can experience the life of the little Gangster you always wanted to be.  In short, for people who like GTA San Andreas-type of games, APB is a blast. Best played with friends and with a Premium subscription. If you don't want to pay or don't have the patience, quickly forget about this game, because it will make you go mad. Trust me.
3905	1	a	best free game ever you will love it 
3907	1	a	i had lots of Fun in APB and i still have
3909	1	a	After I spent 570 Hours on this game and Unfortunatelly I am still going , because yes it is a great Idea and a unique game, similar to it in no other console, it combines 'Sims' (Full Character customization) , Call of Duty(for its shooting nature and the full customization on weapon mods skins etc), Bit more than Need for Speed (for its customization on your cars), GTA (Open world maps you drive around doing missions or troll people by ramming them over or turn their cars upside down when you're bored to run a mission), These are all the advantages, lets see the Disadvantages, Old Unreal Engine, Hackable big time, we bump into hackers all the time during weekends, lag spikes, shots won't register and one day you rock the next day you shoot the actual player and no shots will register on him.  I ve spent money on this game and responsibly I am advising you, there's no actual quality in this game at the moment, It is fun to play good idea, but no Actual quality, it is full of bugs, hacks , it is not a game to take seriously and sucrifice sleep for game-play, recommending this game just because it is a good unique idea, and we had some good times with friends and the great community this game has gathered, unfortunately most of it is gone, soon will update my review with the current most populated servers on 2014 to save you New players some time.

3911	1	a	:)
3913	1	a	An OK game...Not all that impressive because of P2W items and extremely unbalanced matchmaking. The best thing is well, it's free to play you don't have to pay so that's a plus. You could always just hijack store stuff and keep it as low under 2,000 otherwise cops will bust you. Pretty easy money too. Mission I'd probably not play those without having a really good team on your side because most of time they just don't stick together or stick to enemy side instead of your side. Sometimes stupid people too. Some moments you're good at most part, some other moments you will probably most likely to get annoyed, maybe even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because they have a better weapon than you do and they're higher level than you, richer also and there's many veterans that will probably wonder wtf you're doing in a game when you're new. Another issue is Steam WILL glitch implying you are playing a game of APB Reloaded when you quit the game and you have to force shut it down with a Task Manager. I can clearly see why people want this game dead already. P2W ruins it mainly because of OP grenade launcher that practically kill you in 1-2 hits. Some people just claims you hack yet you don't. GG. 3.4 out of 5. Leaning between yes and no on game recommendation, 50/50 neutrality depending on how this game is...
3915	1	a	Amazing game. Can get super cool looking guns. Make your person look however you want. Lots of helpful people. 1 problem. TAKES AGES TO LOAD
3917	1	a	this game is the crossed magnums and the crossed shotguns
3919	1	a	for those who are fans of playing TPS-type games, or you're just looking for something new....this game right here? totally worth it.
3921	1	a	Worth a download.  aka AMAZING!!!
3923	1	a	I like this game alot.
3925	1	a	Its free you can steal cars and shoot people!
3927	1	a	The gameplay and customizing in this game is incredible I have played since the beta and I will always love this game
3929	1	a	Boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when alone. Fun as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with a friend. Customazation of charecter is unlimited oppertunities. 99% of everything is earned. not much pay-to-wins. +supports nicolas cage 9.4/10
3931	1	a	Fun, but major pay 2 win, hackers , maybe lag and kids running their mouth
3933	1	a	Great!
3935	1	a	10 out of 10
3937	1	a	Honestly gta 1 was better than this.
3939	1	a	Awesome GTA styled game. Crazy fun.
3941	1	a	Really good game that you can solo or play with a buddy.Pretty detailed and will keep you shooting for days. Best played with a friend
3943	1	a	^^
3945	1	a	For a game that pisses me off and I get called a hacker for using a sniper that has the capability to kill someone through a slight corner with a well aimed shot, I like it. The customization, the weapons, and the cars are great, but being able to gun down an enemy just feels better! I'd have to recommend playing with a team though. Gets lonely lol.
3947	1	a	Nice games
3949	1	a	Good game! Love it a lot :)
3951	1	a	I love the game, the easy symbol creation, the cool cars, the guns, the cars... Im playing this game quite some time now and i must say that this game is a great game! When i checked it out the first time i was like lets see what the game can do. When i played some time i knew that this game is great made. So now by playing it some time i became a fan!  
3953	1	a	ruined my life :D liek if yuo kry evrey tiem!
3955	1	a	oh hi  nice game   i have 60R in this game :D
3957	1	a	apb is a good game fun but awesome 
3959	1	a	This is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nice game! xD
3961	1	a	Its still a cool game i think and one of my most played games If it had updates at all it would make more people want to play...     This game hasn't been updated in like 4 years 
3963	1	a	this is a great game, just get it it's free for F***SACKE!
3965	1	a	Yo
3967	1	a	I thought it was fun. Not sure why so many negative reviews
3969	1	a	IT WAS FUN THEN I GOT TO GOLD AND THEN WENT AGAINST PEOPLE WITH GUNS YOU BUY FOR $10
3971	1	a	is a good apg game 2ond opticks but the bullet damage is the same on the headshot and the body . thats all i have to say
3973	1	a	I cant get in from this game 
3975	1	a	really fun no hackers seen yet besides fix the load atleast then seems to be like aearly acces game *it should be* but really fun just recommend that when you have bounty cops can see were you are like when they call cops i meen 
3977	1	a	Probally one of the worse games to play. Its full of try hards and the starting mission....you just get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unless you get a massive group. Wouldn't bother downloading.
3979	1	a	Thought it was GTA 4 for free...     I was wrong
3981	1	a	Fun Fun..... not a lot for me to do like drive around since my Fps skills suck but its a fun game.
3983	1	a	This game is one of the best open-world games out there. It is often compared to GTA, but it is so much more than that. It has fully customizable characters and cars, big open-world map, and a social district completely for your customization needs. This game is way better than the way the people on here are making it out to be. It's free, so give it a try. You don't like it, your loss.
3985	1	a	Its a good game and it has high graphics so i reccmoned this
3987	1	a	it's kinda gta for free, but not as good
3989	1	a	Love it, I hate it, but thats why this game is so much fun, you can be losing and the next moment TABLES ARE TURNED, GUN FIRE ALL OVER THE PLACE TEAMMATES BLOWING EACH OTHER UP AND YOUR SUDDENLY WINNING. WATCHOUT ITS A GARBAGE TRUCK READY TO GREIF YOU BADLY...   got carried away there for a moment, but thats how this game makes me feel. its too fun and addicting.  I give thumbs up cause I've been playing for a long while now :) and once you get far in ranking its really enjoyable  Pros: you can meet some pretty interesting people on here and teamwork is vital which is the success to this games team vs team  cons: needs to get rid of the bots and ghosters, and G1 needs to be more truthful and up to date with there releases... still waiting on the engine update.. :( otherwise this is my first longest review, hope you all enjoyed my input...
3991	1	a	its nice and cool &lt;3 the cars and stuff i rate the game 20/17 but its ok 
3993	1	a	Too.... much..... time....... wasted....... *dies*
3995	1	a	This is a vary versitile game that can be both fast paced and slow paced at times. The servers are always being worked on which can at time have a negative effect on the gameplay but they never last so long that it becomes an issue for groups. The in-game features are fantastic and G1 is always releaseing new content for purchase.  This game is very graphically demanding and I would recommend making sure that your PC meets the recomended specs before even thinking about dowloading this game. I run an i7 3770k with a 2BG GTX 660 and I get around 100fps. So make sure that you have good gear in your PC.  I very much recommend this game. It's in third-person which is always a nice change to the normal first person shooter games out there. Very fun with friends and I hope they can continue to develop more content for this amazing game. Get it!
3997	1	a	GTA online FTW !!!
3999	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at start and that is where many people quit.Later on the game gets amazing.
4001	1	a	I've been playing APB reloaded for about 100+hours so far its not that bad i find it quiet fun, if you arent that skilled it could be a complain on match making, im alright with this since i usually get 2k score rating im inbetween gold/silver ranking. To me its not bad at all nothing wrong with it, yes some weapons are OP in Weapon shop which could be considered Pay to win, but i found after i get upgraded stock weapons that usually comes to Tactics and which weapon is equiped but mostly on tactic it self, i killed and won over many Pay to wins.   To me try it out see how it goes dont give up so fast, you must be pretty good at games like a proper 'gamer' good with progression, people who have just started gaming or havent played much of these type of games would find this game abit challenging. How you tell your doing any good is if your getting better scores they do and over 1k score rating and going up most matches, winning.etc barely dieing. those type of things.  Give it a shot, if your good with it its never a problem with match making at all Also adding - stock weapons are pretty good, i still own golds and silvers with it, not really your weapon, tactic/dodge.etc is the aim i do, i even try crouching time to time. Also a tip you should see if they have any perks like Blood clotting and more armor on them selfs, and change your tactic towards that 1 person, usually for the more armored and slow, i usually fire abit and hit them and reload as quick as possible, then full on kill them with the means to kill them.   Also dont go to Hong Kong server as it isnt in 'hong kong' its more in USA side, also it doesnt have many people in it. so i disagree ever going that server. Give it a shot Gamer!
4003	1	a	This is one of the best games i have been playing. Long nights with a lot of rage. This game is definitivly somthing for yea
4005	1	a	Very fun game, lots of varied online play.  Reminds me of GTA, but with a multiplayer aspect. It does have a pay to win aspect, but to be honest the starting guns are great. The only thing worth buying is the premium pack, which gets you like double money from missions.  Really recommend this game if you're looking for some fun filed action!  
4007	1	a	I think this is a sort of gta 5 style game thirdperson customise and much more you get missions guns and lots !!  I would rate this 10/10
4009	1	a	Not bad at all.... Kinda boring at beginning, but Nice Game, thats all ; )
4011	1	a	Overall good,graphics are good,even if you lower it,customizations is cool,aiming is a bit weird,driving is very bad,i prefer playing on foot,as for playing mission,well for a new player it's really hard to figure out what to do &amp; where to go...when playing in multiplayer,the cool thing is that it doesn't lag even if your internet is slow...so it's 6/10
4013	1	a	When I played the Closed Beta in late 2009, it was a really cool game. But when Realtime Worlds, the makers of the game, went down, Gamersfirst took over the game and made it Free-to-play. It is now a pure pay-to-win game with extreme bonuses that are included in the premium membership etc. It's almost impossible to enjoy the game if you're not a premium user.   But hey, give it a try - it's not a bad game afterall!
4015	1	a	Ya this is a kool experience in itself.
4017	1	a	Me and my one friend were driving after this package in the enemy's car and there was a guy on to of the car who had a rocket launcher and blew us up.  69/10
4019	1	a	Was A Great Game! Yet, Now I Have No Reason To Play It die To GTA V!  Say Thanks To Rockstar!
4021	1	a	This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is literally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing flawless. Okay well maybe the only flaw is that i wish the map was bigger and there was alot more new content. But you will enjoy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for a while then come back to it over time. Too bad they're too lazy and understaffed to make new real content. User content can only go so far, although there is plenty of that in this game that anybody can create, even you.
4023	1	a	This game is fun once you start coming upp in rank
4025	1	a	Similar gameplay to GTA but with a little better competitive plays. Though the bad side is that low rank player can get to match up with higher rank opponents
4027	1	a	I can shoot da guns n hurt pplz 10/10 plz nerf power shots tho,too mlg
4029	1	a	i remember playing it a while ago, its amazing, it takes you HOURS IF NOT DAYS to costumize your character, then longer time for the vehicle and so on. 
4031	1	a	This has to be one of the best free2play games that steam has to offer, that's if you have a thing for GTA style games. With the endless customization that involves cars, clothing, music themes, and so on.. this game gives you more possibilities than any other game that has been released.  Pros: Endless amount of customization choices Great Shooting style Easily adaptable for new players  Cons: Not a huge community[Still big enough to enjoy though] Game servers sometimes lag Hackers Griefers [ General multiplayer games have this though]  Driving system seems like it could be better than it is at the moment..  Rating : 8/10   If you're looking for a decent game to play you might as well give this a try and end up becoming addicted, like I have.
4033	1	a	This game is awesome fun to play can be easy and can be hard i reomend this game for 13+
4035	1	a	This game is so bad its good
4037	1	a	Awsome Game, But My Computer Get Blue Screen So That â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Me Off!
4039	1	a	A very fun game, full of hackers and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community. The former is being addressed very well by G1 and their 'FairFight' system. The latter is just there, as it is in any game. Amazing customization, and amazing gameplay. All unbalanced guns have been refined and it now feels as if this is a much better version of GTA Online. I definitely reccomend it. It's worth a try.
4041	1	a	awsome 
4043	1	a	Its a good gmehowever I think everyone wants helicopters, planes, shops and a controller option 
4045	1	a	Even though this game is like grand theft auto it has missions,clans and other things.
4047	1	a	Definitely a fun game! Even on a crappy computer like mine I still find a lot of joy in this game.
4049	1	a	Like that Fairfight :)
4051	1	a	Makes me wanna flip off myself for installing it
4053	1	a	i love this game
4055	1	a	This game makes me sick to my stomach.  Best game ever.
4057	1	a	its awesome
4059	1	a	I just wish they make it more good game
4061	1	a	I love this game!
4063	1	a	This game basically ruined my computer, took me 2 days before it started running back to normal I can play this game at a decent graphic setting but this game is laggy, and very P2W.  Edit: Decided to play again and feels like it has improved pretty decently would recommend. Be warned that this game eats up your RAM.
4065	1	a	First of all, for those who decide to play without a Premium subscription, the game is unforgiving and quite frankly, very frustrating. Every part of the game screams Pay-To-Win with unfair matchups, overpowered weapons, overpowered abilities, overpowered verhicles, high prices for items and so on. Many fights often end up being a question of 'who payed for what' and not 'who has the better skill', which is a real shame, because the the game itself is actually really fun. Everything is extremely customizable. From characters to cars to clothing. You'll never see the same character design twice. Also with activities such as robbing stores, jacking cars, muggin people etc., you can experience the life of the little Gangster you always wanted to be.  In short, for people who like GTA San Andreas-type of games, APB is a blast. Best played with friends and with a Premium subscription. If you don't want to pay or don't have the patience, quickly forget about this game, because it will make you go mad. Trust me.
4067	1	a	I have just one question. How hard is it to make controller support? very shameful
4069	1	a	good free play game
4071	1	a	It wont start when i open the game it says the game is down for a maintrance. I have no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing clue what so ever how to fix it. this is to Gamersfirst. so i have nothing to say about this game, hope you guys like it B cus i cant...
4073	1	a	its has a good driveing as well as real life and you can get cooler looking &gt;:D
4075	1	a	Not good as gta but its fun.
4077	1	a	Full of circle strafing bunny hoppers
4079	1	a	great game
4081	1	a	I'm tom cruise and I say this game is good.  I like pie.
4083	1	a	It's good.
4085	1	a	You respond to flash points or crimes in progress, and complete vital Enforcer operations, keeping the city under tight control. Rewards are paid automatically. Vehicles, weapons and equipment are at your disposal, but as a private citizen, these must be purchased from your own funds. How you choose to look is your own affair. At all times, you must be ready to use lethal or non-lethal force against Criminal insurgents, as authorized in the terms of your license.  Your authority comes straight from the Mayor herself.  San Paro is at war. Protect your city. Now get out there and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up some Crims!
4087	1	a	i is a very good game indeed so but it must be PLAYED FOR ALL THE GAMERS 
4089	1	a	cops and robbers: the game 10/10
4091	1	a	Somebody hear me! 
4093	1	a	APB:Reloaded is the game you keep going back to but at times you don't know why. All in all it is a GREAT game, but sometimes the Community can be a little-a lot rude and the company definitely takes their time with the less important things to fix like the Threat and Matchmaking system.  There are Hackers and Macro users just like any other game. There aren't as many as there used to be but when they do appear now, they're just blatant.   If you're going to start the game off without a friend I would suggest starting off as a Criminal. They can Ram Raid and mug for cash, but as an Enforcer you can witness criminals doing such things. That's a gamble though, with premium and effective play Missions are an amazing source of money. But like I said, as a newbie Ram Raiding would be the way to go.   Asylum and Baylan Shipping are NOT the place for a newbie to be, Hang out in Financial or Waterfront until you get used to the game and unlock some more guns. Play around with your mouse sensitivity until you hit the sweet spot. Guns like the OCA (SMG's) are great starter guns along with the Ntec and the Star 556 (Assault Rifles).   Some people will say Pay 2 Win exists, I don't agree because the Oca, Ntec, and Star are some of the BEST guns in the game that you can get at a very low rank, you will unlock slotted guns for mods to greatly increase the performance or unlock guns that already have mods installed that you cannot change.   Aside from the bad things about this game, it's a great game. I give it a 4/5 for functionality, 2.5/5 for Community, 5/5 for Gameplay, and 4/5 for Story.  
4095	1	a	Great fun, cops and robbers. But look out everyone gets there â™¥â™¥â™¥ kicked once in awhile by overly good players who enjoy a bit of grif. The grif all adds up to the almost school yard feel of cops and robbers, and adds a sense of emersion into the brutal world of a city tearing itself appart in crime and vigilatisem.
4097	1	a	its cool but not that cool 
4099	1	a	Crashing evry 10 mins 11/10
4101	1	a	THE BEST EXPERIENCE EVER THEE FUNEST PART OF ALL PRESSING THAT BUTTION THAT SAIS UNINSTALL OMG SO FUN!!!
4103	1	a	Fun game, ahs a lot of pay to get it quicker type deals but if your are willing to spend the time it can be balanced. If someone spends money it'll likely take you a couple of weeks until you are ready to go toe to toe with him. just an idea of how money can give you a huge advantage. i recommend playing with friends
4105	1	a	If only
4107	1	a	good time waster
4109	1	a	Giant Bilbo Baggins Mess up 
4111	1	a	Really fun to play with a group of friends! Great Customization! Sh*tty servers???? Lots of hackers??? Haven't seen many hackers but the server thing is kinda is sorta definitely true :L But still fun!
4113	1	a	Cops and Robbers, GTA style. What's not to love?   In-game midi sampler to create your own 'theme' In-game MP3 import system for car radio F2P Customisations only limited by number, not customisation.   Only thing is 250ms+ latency makes some missions unplayable, especially against those near the US Datacentres.
4115	1	a	fun game but because of the Tweeny Bopper that play it and the de-threaters it can get on your nerves
4117	1	a	If your waiting for GTA V to come out for the PC like me, this is a fun game to pass time in (assuming you don't want to play GTA IV, of course...)
4119	1	a	Weird, buggy, can be fun at times, but again, like alot of games like this, you get alil outclassed by those players who play all the time.   give it a try, still a fun game, I personally just don't think it's a game that your gonna play all the time.
4121	1	a	i want to play this but it wont function even though i meat the minimal requirements
4123	1	a	Strong Recomendation!
4125	1	a	Next generation MMOTPS. This game is ahead of it's time, that unfortunately makes it run only in newer PC, but if you have one, you will enjoy it.
4127	1	a	its ok
4129	1	a	i dont care about the rating or other reviews. this game is what i'd call the second gta 5 online. its great and its for the computer which i'd call a cool game so argue all u want about this i still say this needs more people
4131	1	a	after playing it for a little bit i have this to say its K but not to K
4133	1	a	The best free to play game on steam. Very fun if you like open world GTA style third person shooters.
4135	1	a	Do you like spending real money over and over agian on the same game? Well this one is for YOU!! Friends are needed to play and have fun IMO, being the cops can be quite dull most times, and the crooks are ballin. The power of the darkside is everywhere, no one should be able to survive. He runs the underworld with a deathly fist. Why you ask, because it's raining .... raining upon my teary eyed face with no way to tell if you are Dead or Alive?!
4137	1	a	i like this game nice to play you get lost in it 8 out of 10
4139	1	a	This game is amazing. Any game I can build a Mystery Machine and rob stores with it, I am for it.
4141	1	a	So, here you are. You're debating whether or not to press that sweet, sweet play now button. What could be the harm? I mean, you've heard it has a great customization system. It looks a little like GTA, and since you're too poor (or cheap) to pay for the actual game, you've come to the free version of it.  Well, as all free things come with, this game will have its downsides.  'Good' Things: - Awesome customization - Physics=non-existent - Be half naked and you still have the same amount of health as a kickass SWAT team member - Did I mention walking through the social district is essentially the same as watching porn? - Car customization too.  Bad things. Really, really bad things: - Pay to win. People will deny that it's true, but it is. Some guns can take you down in a simple two hits. Some guns can take out a car in one hit. - The presets for their character creation are TERRIBLE. It looks like you just rose from the grave to kill someone if you choose the female model (like me). - So I heard you liked cars? Well, be prepared to grind endlessly through missions to get the money and 'Joker tickets' to buy them. -Matchmaking is terrible. You may be a bronze rank (ranking being from bronze, to silver, to gold with gold being the highest) and be paired up with a full squad of golds.  - You CAN'T LEAVE A MATCH WITHOUT QUITTING THE ENTIRE GAME. - If you randomly get rocketed to gold rank like I did, when you can't kill people for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and are just playing to customize, guess what? No more going onto lower ranking servers, because obviously everyone who gets gold rank is MLG af. - 10 year olds.  10/9 would play for the rest of my days for clothing.
4143	1	a	good but rage inducing game
4145	1	a	Make no mistake, this is not GTA. It is it's own thing. And it's a big give and take. The big attraction is the customization for characters and cars. It's VERY involved, and I love it. The gun play is passable, not great, but it has it's moments. Driving is terrible, it feels just totally wrong. The game modes are a lot of fun, with one exception. You can only get so much fun out of this game without friends to play with.
4147	1	a	Dont let my steam play hours fool you. I've been playing APB off and on again sense Key to the City was a 3 day early access pre-order bonus under RTW (makers of the game) and not a +$90 cash shop bundle. So iv got closer to 500-1000hrs.  This game was great in its early years. This is the game that got me into PC gaming. This is the game i joined my first clan in. Nothing is more fun than a GTA style mmo. I dont even know how to write a review about this game so im just gonna do another Pros and Cons.  Pros:  Gameplay - its just plain fun to play cops and robbers Competitive - people talk trash and tbag. If your a big baby then dont play this game. There are REALLY good players that will seem like they are hacking but most aren't. Ranking - theres Green, bronze, silver and gold that indicates your win to lose ratio. Customization - ITS CRAZY. It no Illustrator but some artists could fool me. Thereâ€™s little more thatâ€™s as satisfying than when you sell a car and you run into the person that bought it in game. Guns - Guns, guns, guns. I love guns. Down bullets go. Into ur torso. mm mm mm. Little guns, big guns, guns that go boom. i lovem all. 1-3 mod slots with each mod having their own pros and cons. Prebuilt guns if you not a high level for slotted ones too. Missions - Theres only a hand full but there's enough variety and locations on the map where they take place that you hardly notice.  TDM - eh, not my thing but people like it. I like to have a mission instead of just running around shooting peopl. Music - you can play music from your PC in game to feel like a badass. I'm not entirely sure how it works now but it used to be if the game didn't know what the song was it would play it for you and play a song of the same genera for others.  Cons: Pay to win (?) - it used to be VERY pay to win. in the last week or so that iv started playing again i havenâ€™t noticed this as much. Prices - A single gun can cost $40 to keep it permanently. Luckily thereâ€™s a try it first mode. Renting guns - you donâ€™t buy a gun with in game money and keep it. you rent it for 10 days, buy the ammo and rent the gun again if you like it. Its a cash sink to get you to pay for the monthly sub. Im not gonna list the sub as a con because you only need 2-3 months of it to get what you want. Crybabies - SOOO many people cry hacker. People will just sit back and let the timer run out on the mission or straight up rage quit adding another loss to your ratio. In the early days my clan was accused of hacking almost every match. Its hilarious sometimes. Ranking - this is also a con because of the lack of gold ranked people. Almost all servers are rated for silver or bronze players. If youâ€™re a gold ranking going into a silver or bronze rated server then you get penalties in XP and money. This is to keep golds from rolling over the less skilled people but sense thereâ€™s less people playing these days itâ€™s more of a problem for golds. False Promises - Gamersfirst are just a big bunch of liers. They promised racing maps, more mission maps and bla bla bla it was all a lie. Maps became a chunk of a mission map for TDM and racing maps still donâ€™t exist. Racing was supposed to be a way to unlock car parts but i guess they just want cash for that.  I love this game and as long as they keep the hackers out and the P2W model down low, ima keep on loven.  P.S. its bested played with a group so find a clan.
4149	1	a	Simply put one of the best free to play games ever.
4151	1	a	Rated A for A-holes.
4153	1	a	A pritty fun game. u can be a cop or gamgsta. extream car chasings, lots of shootouts. pritty much all u can expect from a theme like that. and probably the best and most detailed caracter costumization i ever saw in a game.  Only think i dislike, or maybe am not used too. no headshots. at the end it comes 2 who has the gun with the most damage or who is tricky enough and gides behind walls or cars fast enough. At the end it is a pritty decent game, And funn too play
4155	1	a	123
4157	1	a	After having a lot of problems trying to actually play the game, I finally got to play it! It's great fun, very balanced, and has hours of gameplay!
4159	1	a	This game is dardy. i have played it for 3 years now and i still cringe every time i get back on it &lt;3
4161	1	a	It's good, but there is a pay2win aspect, but you can overcome such. It's pretty fun, and there are events where you can gain items that you'd usually pay for therefore lowering the pay2win ratio.
4163	1	a	this game Rocks
4165	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. I need a life.
4167	1	a	Hack ur azz off AKA APB! Good game to fuel the rage!
4169	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing owns
4171	1	a	Very Nice Game,Fast And Full Of Action,Really Cool ;)
4173	1	a	its a relly good game download it  
4175	1	a	really awesome
4177	1	a	0/10 did not even download the game
4179	1	a	This game has the best customization, hands down, BUT it's cameplay is imbalanced, and very much so pay2win, but even then, it's fun to play.  For those that jsut like doing random crap and looting random places, play it.  For those who are more competitive, or easily angered when killed, I wouldn't reccomend playing it.
4181	1	a	GTA Quality!
4183	1	a	Originally released in summer 2010, published by EA and developed by the now defunct RealTime Worlds, APB is a competitive 3rd Person Shooter Sandbox Massively Multiplayer Online Game with rich character customization as one of it's primary features. Now in the hands of GamersFirst and Reloaded Productions, APB has been relaunched as APB: Reloaded, aiming to enhance the original, and expand on content. APB can be a fun game in short bursts, but will quickly become frustrating with it's steep difficulty curve and dependance on better gear, obtained either with ingame currency or through the ARMAS Market (Cash Shop). The system requirements are also painful if you wish to play on the highest settings, however, the requirements have been reduced in order to appeal to a larger market than when it launched in summer 2010. Despite my less than glowing review, I still recommend that you at least try this game.
4185	1	a	Interesting. Need to play more.
4187	1	a	seriously, wtf are you doing reading this? PLAY THIS GAME!!  APB is an online 3rd person â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t simulator.  Hours of fun can be had and sometimes you just cant help yelling 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T!' at your screen as you get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ handed to you.  Though nothing beats the feeling of rolling in a car through the city with some good friends who you know got your back.
4189	1	a	Really fun, any guns that are available for real money can be obtained with in game currencey. My only complaint is that it will sometimes randomly lag for apparently no reason, but but other than that it's a really fun game that's deffinentally worth a try.
4191	1	a	Fun game, but criminals have too much nice stuff ;(
4193	1	a	Really fun, if you decide to play, make a guy on Colby NA West and a criminal then msg me
4195	1	a	Amazing game, defenately worth a try. However, preapare to grind a little for good items.
4197	1	a	My game is broken but i have played it before and its realy good. 
4199	1	a	
4201	1	a	THE GOOD GAME
4203	1	a	i honestly think this game is cool but after playing a couple mounths of it, it gets old and i start to rage it seams that there is a good comunity and a bad one in thisgame there are some hackers nto alot tho so i would recomend that you guys try it for your self.
4205	1	a	this game is amazing (if you have friends to play with)  you can be anyone you want to be, from ugly â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to adlof hitler lol ( thats okay im jewish) 
4207	1	a	Nice game (sometimes) I spent here a lot of hours. :) Cheaters can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off you very fast and it is wasting of your nerves.  So think twice are you sure that you want to try this. :)
4209	1	a	Must try
4211	1	a	One of the BEST games I have played. A lot of action packed shoot outs, you ahve to have a tactical mind to survice this ...and a little bit of luck :D . AWESOME options to customise you character or crew. A must have for a fan of shooter games and adrenaline rushes :3
4213	1	a	i wish the game had less standards to be useable like it should have a lower video card option and graphics card but other wise i love it
4215	1	a	super teamwork
4217	1	a	Its awfully balanced and the guns that you pay for are clearly better than the ones you get by just playing. Yet i keep coming back to it
4219	1	a	This game is really cool and i know its been out for a while but if u havent tried it plz do.
4221	1	a	6/10 Good Graphics *10/10 Customization -Weapons, Outfits, CARS 5/10 PvP -Takes getting use to  
4223	1	a	worst game ever, totally sucks :3
4225	1	a	Fun if you have people to play with :P
4227	1	a	dis game iz really guud
4229	1	a	I actually do recommend this. I really liked the online gameplay, graphics, weapons, and especially the cars. I had a lot stuff put into this game but I actually lost everything about 2 years back. I uninstalled this game because I kept getting an error on startup. So, I don't even remember my account anymore lol. But, I do remember the fun times I had in this game. Pretty fun! :)
4231	1	a	never lets me load the game dont know why
4233	1	a	I played in the Original BETA with RealTime Worlds. This version KICKS MORE ASSSS!!! Play it. Come onto Server: Patriots EU2
4235	1	a	free gta pretty good
4237	1	a	great for when you want a cause of suicide!
4239	1	a	Pay to win from when I played it, but I think it got better, and it was always fun....third person kind of makes angle camping kind of common, but I always recommend free games.
4241	1	a	it's good. for a free to play game.
4243	1	a	Played it and I really enjoy playing it with friends, however I wish there was more to do.
4245	1	a	You Want a cool looking avatar you need to spen at least three hours on it. you want a cool car 5 hours plus some money. you want to win? you either give up your life savings or your whole life
4247	1	a	Basically GTA: Online but with more general customization and less graphic capability and... the physics are not as good as GTA: Online's.
4249	1	a	10/10 would f*ck sh*t up again.
4251	1	a	Hate it or love it. ill be there to greet with a Propel rocket to the face &lt;3
4253	1	a	good game for fps players
4255	1	a	This game is brillant
4257	1	a	Is it good? Sorta. Is it fair? Not really...? Is it fun? Definatly.
4259	1	a	Awesome game, free version of GTA? probably.. yes sometimes you might get mad at this game but think again, at least your playing something. 
4261	1	a	its like a ex wife thats really hot, you play it for one part that turns into a addiction and hate all the other parts.
4263	1	a	wish this game didnt have as many hackers as it does. i really loved this game for a long time but it just got way too out of hand.
4265	1	a	People say this game is Pay To Win... But it's not, when i started to play this game i killed people that had Payed items which wasn't that difficult, However if you save money like me you can get really cool and good stuff from the shops in the game. For example if you spend real money on to the game its just giving stuff that looks better and its upgraded little bit too. I played this game for few hours and i am so close to get a really good car without spending no real life money. Hope this changed your mind about this game. :)
4267	1	a	I don't know about any of you but I enjoy the game. I haven't found it repetative like others say, but whatever. I would give it 7/10. Just like almost all games, I want to get that one thing and when I finally get it I don't want to play it anymore. So you wait a while and then the game gets fun again.  Describe this game in one word: Co-op
4269	1	a	You know, as much as I rage at this game, I find myself coming back to it time and time again. For one reason, it's addictive, you might have a bad day, not win a single damn mission, but, when you finally do, it's a feeling so damn sattisfying that you can't help but cheer. If you're a fan of third person shooters and Online play with against and with other players, this is deffinatly a game I would recomend. Another reason as to why I enjoy this game so much is due to the sheer ammount of custimization possible. Especially with premium. With premium membership, you can place up to fifty. Yes, 50 different designs on a peice of clothing, not to mention tattoos, hairstyls, a full face custimzation with pleanty of sliders to play around with to get it just right. Try it, you just might like it.
4271	1	a	This game is like GTA but free and it's funny
4273	1	a	Great, fun and creative game with friends!
4275	1	a	Pros! 1.) Open World 2.) Game Currency 3.) Missions 4.) Carnage  Cons! 1.) Long loading screen 2.) Not enough cars/ cost too much 3.) Not balanced teams
4277	1	a	I played this game befor it was on steam and I like it. The custimization is everything. no Joke if it is in the game you can custimize it. A game I suggest to play. But the game gets repetitive, and some weapons like the sniper rile ae over powered. And people like streaking so yah. p.s. JOKER AMMO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
4279	1	a	pretty snazzy shoot shoot bang bang dead
4281	1	a	It always opens to the updating screen but no progress happens. What should I do?
4283	1	a	This game is fun... If you have friends to play it with! Very few things I can say about it... theres honestly not that much to it.  *Logs In* *Sees Friend* *Watches friend get ran over*   Thats pretty much the game.    10/10 Would watch friend die again.
4285	1	a	This is a great game if you want to have some competitive gameplay... it is Recommended that sometimes you play with friends because you may run across the usual Elite Gamer (Hackers Many people call them &gt;.&gt;) but the game offers a very in depth character customization and creation from what you wear to the car you drive! there are alot of diffrent guns that you can use and try and maybe even down the line if you find something you love you can put alittle money forward and get that gun, go out... shoot everyone up and RULE THE WORLD!!!!!  10/10 Will go on a rampage again
4287	1	a	Ä°ts Fantastic game I playing this game 7/24 :D
4289	1	a	its a fun free game like gta with way more customization allowed i recomebd this game to all who like shooters
4291	1	a	Good Game but as soon as you reach Gold there is many people with Hacks - Triggerbots etc. Kind of sad, very low hack protection and a lot of very low Rank people without anything but are gold, mhmm suspicious.. Apparently it should get better soon
4293	1	a	Its a great game. good things are that you can, edit your caracter 99% the way you want if you know how to and have the time, editing cars is a great thing when you dont rage YOU will, it goes on and on now bad things, No motorbikes please bring it to the game pls, if you dont have a friend too play whit you will be bored easly, the rage that you can get in this game is SO big, Its a pay to win game almost      Sorry for bad english BYE GONNA MISS YOU :(
4295	1	a	Great game, needs a bit of a polish the come up to the expectations of gamers but the ideas are great! The story lacks and you just need to ignore it and continue in a rampage across the city!!!
4297	1	a	this game is awesome! love the Customization in it, and its just really fun driving around as a cop :D lol!! highly recomend ^_^
4299	1	a	If you like game such as gta well this is the game for you , you can be cops or the criminals insanely fun however its a bit of pay to win but if your looking for a bit of fun this is for you.
4301	1	a	Hit the streets as a licensed vigilante or hardened criminal in the crime-ravaged metropolis of San Paro where shootouts, car-chases, robbery, and vandalism are all in a day's work. Prove yourself to your chosen organization and you could earn fame, deadly weapons, exotic vehicles, and stylish new clothing; fail.But is too cool
4303	1	a	this game is like a low budget gta but its free to play and its rly fun.
4305	1	a	Fun game...if you are a GTA fan this game is like it.
4307	1	a	Great co-op Grand Theft Auto. But bloody hardware requirements... :(
4309	1	a	go game laggy tho 
4311	1	a	This is a good game. It can get boring from time to time, however it is similar to Grand Theft Auto maybe a little more bland however it is a good game I would recommend to people 8/10
4313	1	a	This was my favorite game ever, and always will be, even though it absolutely sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ now. 11/10 IGN
4315	1	a	Great game, and its free to play. I recommend this game for everyone who enjoys playing action games.
4317	1	a	Its a pretty awesome game! It's a lot like GTA. Only issue is the steering on the cars... its hard to steer.
4319	1	a	This game is great for a F2P. It feels like GTA sanandreas except a cops and robbers version of that game.  Pros The game would easily cost money and be well worth it but its F2P  Progressive gameplay gives you a goal to keep playing   you never fill pressured to spend actual money on the game as you can just use in game currency to purchase every   thing you need and want with in game currency. Cons  Ive had some bad experience with the comunity so I just mute everybody. it saves me from having to listen to the pure duchbaggery that people on this game can be It's not just me its quite a large group of people having a disconecting problem it happens randomly you could be afk or in a mission or looking for a mission the game will dc you and you will have to sit throught the long as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ loading screens.  My final thoughts on the game is that its a clunky F2P open world 3rd person shooter with a good idea but poor exacution. The comunity is bad and allot of them are whinny and imature but this is just my experience. the game is addicting and can be fun its worth about 20 dollars well worth a try    also people say gta clone I say true crime and saints row jumped off a building and this is the spatter they scrapped off the pavement.
4321	1	a	Its a game of anger
4323	1	a	APB reloaded is Very Closely related to GTA however it is far from it. The game can be fun with a team or group of friends. The team Is Highly Pay to win though. People whom Pay for Prem get Everything just about and Is/are able to have better weapons and when 2xs more money in game to get things. The biggest Issue with the game is team Balance. There is none. You get matched up with people that are WAY higher ranked then you're self and they Expect you to deal with the fact that that have Armor on and BEtter weapons that wipe you out in a heartbeat. Would I recommend the game yes but For more of a casual play on occasion sorta thing
4325	1	a	it is good game . I can say it is only game with have police mod on it but it is full of lag i have 1Gb internet but i have lag on it my system is not bad too   AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 260 Processor 3.2 GHz  RAM 4.00 GB ATI Radeon HD 5450 512mb win 7 pro
4327	1	a	Overall a really nice game. Has a nice character customization. I would compare it to a Saints Row / GTA mix. Great to play with friends and is overall very fun.
4329	1	a	I really loved this game, unfortunately my computer wasn't good enough to handle any of it's AWESOMENESS...so I had to uninstall it...*sadface*
4331	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!! :D)
4333	1	a	Okay I guess. heres a list of pros and cons  Pros: -Amazing character customization -High population districts -Fight clubs to practice  Cons: -Silvers must play with golds -Horrid Driving -Bad Optimization -Bad Match making -Bad Graphics -Never any new content -Greedy Dev Team -Not really any new content announced for the future -Hit the head or the legs same damage  
4335	1	a	This game is stupid but it's fun to mess around in. It's like GTA IV's multiplayer except with more meat and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ier engine (the community is just as bad though!). I wouldn't recommend it without a friend to play with, unless you actually enjoy Arabs and Mexicans screaming at you in teamchat for 'stun gun is bad pick up a real gun noob'.
4337	1	a	It's a really bad game that I happen to like.
4339	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game
4341	1	a	To be honest, this game is familiar to Saints Row. The game is good, but could use some improvements. Playing with friends is fun though :)  7/10
4343	1	a	This game is like a really bad cigarette; Really expensive and you know it's terrible but it is so addicting you just can't stop. Playing with friends I recommend, don't expect it to be easy either. Raging will be involved, but it only makes you want to get better.
4345	1	a	Every game has its players that take the game seriously and play to the best of their abilities. But APB takes tryharding and trolling to a whole new level. These players just do not stop the tryharding my guess is they are Counter Strike Amatuer league rejects. Trust me you will get outplayed. and trolled.
4347	1	a	If you like to rage a lot, this is your type of game.
4349	1	a	Likes to randomly crash, but other than that it's a good game
4351	1	a	Unbelievable....  1. The graphics are Good, You can customize your cars and characters.  2. The gameplay is Super EPIC! You can choose Terrorist or Cops!  3. The FINAL... Its not just singleplayer missions and coop. Theres even PVP Missions!   THIS IS EPIC!! You should have this...
4353	1	a	I really good PvP MMO but the vehicle controls are crap...  It feels like you are driving a boat not a car :(
4355	1	a	This game is really good in my opinion I havent played the game properly you know but its still a realy good game and very fun. very customizable.
4357	1	a	I used to play and I was good, now I dont play and I am â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Only play this game if you are going to be consistantly playing it.
4359	1	a	Not The Best Game I've Ever Played, But It Can Still Improve To Be Better :)
4361	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played its fun to play i Recommend it to everyone
4363	1	a	You know, ever since I got my new gaming computer and a lot of money to spend on Steam, I thought I would return to this game and give it a look. Now I read all of the more popular reviews, and I do not deny their complaints. Unbalance and camping is an issue, I am sad to say I take part in this. But heres what people don't understand... this game requires some actual f***king teamwork to do the missions effectively and to plow right through the camping team. The game does not look the best, but it is one of the most flawed masterpieces that are free I have seen. It is the GTA: Online we want. You could run it on a potato with a screen attached to it and it would still run. 3 almost 4 years later, they are still updating and fixing the game! I played GTA: Online on console, it got boring rather quick because there is no real challenge or anything really, it is all created by the players themselves in the bad sense. Here, they have systems to keep the system balanced while also having the difficulty up high.  Where it shines...  Where this game shines is in the customization department. It has been rated one of the best customization system in gaming because of how diverse you can make your character from everyone else. Both sides have their pros and cons and their balance is equal due to the nature of getting the same weapons. Veterans are rewarded better guns but they are not too much of an improvement. Criminals have easier opprotunities to earn money outside of missions but they don't make as much as Enforcers. Enforcers don't have as many opprotunities to earn money outside of missions but they get 2x the amount of money for winning missions. It is all about skill.  Where it falls...  Where this game falls flat is in some of the open world aspects. Emotes are locked off for some reason and the higher your rank, the more you unlock. NPC's all have repeating player models but at least have different languages. Grenades are delayed in killing a player if it is right at their feet, vehicles driven by enemies can run you over and kill you at anything higher than 5 miles an hour. Free to play players are given limitations on how complex their character can look, and complexity is added with decals, customization, etc of clothing, though the preset clothes offer insanely high complexity if they are worn which could conflict your outfit, which you get 2 slots for outfits and an additional one for completing the tutorial objectives. Vehicles handle decently but good luck trying to go in a fast car and not get lag from the high amount of pop in on max settings. Lag is caused by pop in and that one prick from a 3rd world country who wants to play on an english server and has bad internet. And finally weapons tend to get very unbalanced if your up close and personal, there is no melee attacking so you have to spray more bullets into the bad guy's face than they do to you.  It may sound like I am ripping on this game, but it is still a more playable GTA than any other gta games on steam.
4365	1	a	good game by gamerslast
4367	1	a	I think they should make this Mac supported :) Its a really good game and would be even better if everyone had access
4369	1	a	Fast cars, Sweet guns, and money (that isn't yours) sounds amazing, but when you play the game, you get to live it.
4371	1	a	A good GTA like game that has a lot of customizations but it is multiplayer. A lot of missions and contacts that are fun to play with. But there are many hackers in the game which sucks. But it is really an awesome game after all. I will recommend this game to open-world gaming fans. :)
4373	1	a	Very fun, very exciting and it makes me hard! This game has so much to it, there is almost never something to not do, but warned little wallets, they vant ur moneyz I do not recommend purchasing ANYTHING for this game, it's a free game, it's fun to keep it that way
4375	1	a	It takes a while to get use to but the online is smooth. Im a new player and its ok from the start 8/10.
4377	1	a	Amazing game when playing with friends!
4379	1	a	is a cool game it looks like SR3
4381	1	a	five out of fiddy this games a niddy diddy ( Í¡Â°â•­ÍœÊ–â•®Í¡Â° )
4383	1	a	A good free to play game, with one of the best customization options in any game, with an interesting setting, if u wish a gta mp style game, this is it.
4385	1	a	.
4387	1	a	OMG I Love this game. Best game. Just like GTA
4389	1	a	Its really good and Ienjoy it every single time I play it
4391	1	a	Fun game- Well worth playing and spending many hours wit.
4393	1	a	good game by gamerslast
4395	1	a	Love tHis GTA Based Free To Play Game :)
4397	1	a	Not bad! Plenty of customization and quite a bit to keep you busy. Great gameplay with freinds
4399	1	a	Love the game! Just wish there was less cheaters.
4401	1	a	Gameplay is so-so, not bad, not the best. However! The Level of customazation is immense! Character, symbol, and cars can be changed to look EXsactly as you like.
4403	1	a	10/10 good for kids who arent old enough for gta yet i started playing this in 4th grade i played the crap out of it this game is technically almost like gta online but this came first some parts simular some parts not seriously try this game amazing best game of 2011-2014
4405	1	a	BEST GAME EVER 10/10  too bad its so hard to run though but on my pc i can run it 65FPS max settings but my friend can only run at min settings 25FPS with frame drops
4407	1	a	DO IT!
4409	1	a	This is such a great game. It's basically Grand Theft Auto but you're playing with and also against other people online. It is funny and very entertaining. The graphics are amazing and you need a really good computer. But, best of all, it's FREE. Download it, trust me.
4411	1	a	Good and fun game just one problem, too many overpowered weapons and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, take that out and the game is great.
4413	1	a	Endless playing. Very dynamic. You can never get bored playing, theres lots to do
4415	1	a	grand theft auto on steroids
4417	1	a	cool game
4419	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off
4421	1	a	What could be better you can drive cars, shoot pedestrians, and robs stores! And for the people who say this is a bad game try playing it now!
4423	1	a	This game is great fun and you easily get hooked to it. Both maps are amazing and teamwork strives in this game. The customization is epic and will get you editing you characted/cars for hours. The major problem to this game is that it is a pay to win, if you are going to spend some money, think twice.
4425	1	a	Great game, sort of. The guns are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you could shoot somebody point blank in the head and they could turn around and kill you with their pay to win guns. A massive pay to win game, bullet damage of a North Koreans nutsack.
4427	1	a	It's pay to win &amp; the loading screens got loading screens... but still you can make you character look awesoome!
4429	1	a	Have lost tones of hours of my life in this game.But it deserves that.Only con so many cheaters and glitchers.
4431	1	a	Brilliant online MMO and completely free! Easy to lose hours at a time.
4433	1	a	it is telling me i need a apb laucher that i did not install it correctly what can i do to fix this issue
4435	1	a	Aimbots, Lag, and Disconnections. Pay to win. 10/10
4437	1	a	Best free game you can get on steam. Its extra fun if you have some friends added into the mix.
4439	1	a	Good game guys. Play tutorial, finish your task and get ready for action.  Note: If Punkbuster kick your â™¥â™¥â™¥, go here and download:  http://www.punkbuster.com/index.php?page=pbsetup.php   Then find APB Reloaded and update it (with Punkbuster).
4441	1	a	The bad:  -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Community {10% of the community is Fine {90% of hackers, kids, f*ckers (griefers, insulting you,tryhards etc..) It's at a point to prefer League of legends community than this ... mh ... nothing, just kill it.  -Bad matchmaking -Lag usually (servers are toasters, getting DDoS-ed sometimes and take years to be back) -Need Supercomp to run fine, and supercomp or not: Fps drops like dubstep : stand in front of a burning car = -30fps ~ -Anticheat is crappy, ban randomly: Freeban for everyone, legit or hackers, you spend 400$ in this game? Log in and see error 10008: Permabanned! -Armas marketplace (shop) is very expensive  The good:  -Awesome concept, sadly it's failing. -Freedom of custom (need premium in big part, so you must pay) -Events (50% are events to make you buy something) -Lol  [WARNING]  -Play this game kill your mood -You become aggressive -Be rich if you want something -People prefer pay a hack than buy something on it, or both. -Don't break your keyboard on it, it's useless
4443	1	a	Crashing realy gets me wet, I love this game
4445	1	a	Greatest game ever, worst comunity ever. MONEY . The biggest problem . It will destroy this game, everybody is so focused to get money from customers and give them â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest service ever. I dont know if that is trend in 21th century. But every fuc*ing single game that has been created around 2007-now is so damn focused to get money from players so much that i am sick of that, the corruption is spreading all over the developing studios. Everybody want to get fuc*ing rich, but they forgot about happines... So yeah , fuc* you all developers, delete my review if you want, but the message would be here, spreading and corrupting your tricky bussines. Game creators should not be rich. Remember that. Its a work, not a fuc*ing slavery for us, the players. Dont make us suffer for your obsession with money. We want to play and relax, you should not pay for relax. I have an idea for you, you see those banners ingame ? What if you insert in those som Ads from internet and make money from that ? Would not be that smarter ?
4447	1	a	takes a long time to load but it is fun 
4449	1	a	Steal Cars/City Massacre/ Who Cares about the actuall story and challenges: The game  10/1  10x better than humanly possible!
4451	1	a	Best thing to realize is that i cant play the damn thing because my account doesnt 'Work' and im stuck at the damn loading screen forever  10/10 Would play loading screen simulator again.
4453	1	a	I love this game! 
4455	1	a	Amazing customization GTA like gameplay online anarchy i love this game!
4457	1	a	This game is pay2win
4459	1	a	A simple fun game best played with friends,graphics are good,despite not being top notch,gameplay is relatevly smooth,a big playerbase,wich most of the time cheats or is premium or both,it can sometimes make you nervous to death,but if you look for a game where you can play with freinds and laugh at the bugs and all kinds of over the top missions,you'll like the game.Don't buy anything with real money,though,heard that the game has terrible customer support.
4461	1	a	nice game buy i dont know how to buy colision? ! â„¢ 
4463	1	a	I hear they are doing an engine overhaul!!!!???
4465	1	a	Always come back to this game, it's just different to everything else that it's compelling honestly. It's not very rewarding or welcoming for newer players, and basically has a skill 'cliff' once you start playing with better people. It's an amazing game once you get into it. Please don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing listen to the 'p2w' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that some people still believe, the N-Tec, Joker Carbine, PMG, and HVR are the best guns, which can all be bought very quickly as you hop into the game for the first time. A lot of the guns you don't know are usually just reskins of the HVR or N-Tec you get through loyalty rewards, purchased on the store, or from endgame contacts. Some missions are flawed, like VIP missions and a few unfair locations for them. All guns are usable at certain distances, and you change a lot. It's nice. Trust me son.
4467	1	a	A horrible example of grand theft auto. You do missions but it was all PVP. There was hardly any info on the game other than 'awesome' descriptions that don't match the actual game after 2 hours of play.  The community around the game was just as bad, nobody answering questions on the chat channels or even trying to group up. Leave it all to auto-queue and don't bother trying to make friends inside the game.
4469	1	a	Good customization
4471	1	a	Great for shenanigans, as in screwing other players over, by exploding the cars or ramming them over with larger size trucks.  Used to run great before, now i just can't for some reason.
4473	1	a	Best troll simulation. Great game, community makes it hilarious, a couple of weapons can seem very p2w, you will rage if you're easily angered by games, Criminals seem to have the most veteran players, Golds (rank) will trash talk when they beat you and trash talk when they lose (X'D), Everything from your character to your car is EXTREMELY customizable, you can say what you want and create what you want, people will not help you unless you can further their wins, people with rpgs will spam rpgs and then talk â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because you died by their rpgs, kids play this (not sure if majority, hard to tell), guys play as girls to get attention and help from veteran players (a method many players now take), as starting out you will most likely get put up against a silver by 60% and golds by 40% depending on time of the day (More golds on at night and in the morning), if you are good at this game you will be called a hacker a lot, nobody in this game plays for fun (but me), game was made by real time worlds (great company) but then game was given to trolls, who bred more trolls and now this game is full of trolls young and old. In all I suggest this game for the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and giggles, but not for a serious gamer. Good luck. Did I mention it's free to pla--- troll?
4475	1	a	Man, what can I say? I'm basically playing my character from San Andreas, busted out of Federal Prison after 10 years!   Different city, sure. But the street feel is familiar. High nostalgia hit for the violent 300lb homie covered in badly spelled jail tattoos. MO Cops and Robbers. Ultraviolent roadrage incidents. Taggin' grafitti spots. Rollin' in a group. Customizing clothes to wear or sell. Kitting out mods to make life bearable against live opponents. 4 levels of Threat: Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold...Open Bounties on Prestige 5 Enforcers and Notorious Criminals. Decent variety of vehicles and weapons to unlock.  Cons:- not real minuses, but worth noting. Playing from Australia on Han server, expect noticable lag if map population is over 40. Still playable with up to 60 on a map, but you better let someone closer to the server drive. Much past that and it's not great. There will be undrawn walls to collide with, stuttered audio and ghosting. But you can always hit the Marina Social District and work on designs, or swap map instances to a less populated map. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics can be difficult to use. Important to pick the closest server. Match making can feel a bit off at times.  Pros: Multiple instanced maps. 3 mission districs with average threat level displayed, and open conflic maps where the matchmaking is turned off, plus Fight Club. But I won't talk about Fight Club. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics are easy to learn. Same as basic movement substituting handbrake for jump. If you're a GTA fan who just wants to play Cops and Robbers with some open-world interactions and a story if you want it, this could well be the game for you. If matchmaking is off, or teams are unbalanced, you can call for backup.  Fairfight Anti Hacking seems to work, not much problem with hackers these days. The ban announcements pop up in the chat window for everyone to see. Doesn't appear to be Pay-to-Win, they claim tactics can win over load-out. I've seen that, too. Gold players will hand you your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unless you're an exceptional lower Threat player, in which case you'll go up in rating faster.   This is an &lt;R&gt; rated game. Not for kids. Thought I should mention that. Bombings, Arson, Carjackings, Muggings, Ram-Raids, money laudering, automatic weapons and bad language. It's rated &lt;R&gt; for a m___________g reason, yeah?   Welcome to San Paro.
4477	1	a	Nice game, still playing it. Playing this cuz cant buy GTA V... and its fun
4479	1	a	It's very cool game and very annoying one..
4481	1	a	Fun and addictive game, can be frustrating. Needs more content, the developers seem to only add variations of content already in the game.
4483	1	a	Conclusion from an 4 years veteran playing from 2012 (200 hrs on steam but over 1000 on gamersfirst) :  Customazation is sick, by sick i mean very good and you can customize every single part of your car/clothes. The game isnt pay-to-win how others say, you can buy everything with in game cash and contacts maxed out. OP weapons that can be buyed with real money? YES, but the game isnt ptw at all. I never spent money on this game and i played for 4 years. The game is fun with friends/clan/groups, without them if you go solo there are chances to lose because of bad teammates. The community in-game is toxic but on the forums its really helpful. The servers are practically 'sh*t'. Lag spikes everywhere for medium PCs and connection problems. The developers arent the best either, they want to come with a new engine upgrade (hope that this will fix lag spikes) but we havent heard anything from them ever again. I can understand them as before gamersfirst took over the game from REALTIME WORLDS they had a bunch load of prgrammers..and now with GAMERSFIRST there is only a Lead programmer who is forced to learn the way the programmers before him coded. The games has much potential but GAMERSFIRST is kinda broken. If you want to enjoy a game like GTA, APB is the thing for you but dont spend too much time or money on it, as i assume this game will shut down somewhere in the near future and your progression will be lost. This is my conclusion over the years. Lets all hope APB will be the same as it was before GAMERSFIRST took it over. I rly recommand it if you like GTA games so i will give it a YES!
4485	1	a	had fun playing
4487	1	a	Nice game
4489	1	a	Lags So much you would want to rip your own eyeballs out and jump of a clif  A lot of scammers   Devs are a$$holes  Sick a$$ seasonal events   Has a grenade launcher that fires snowballs  1000/10 would get addicted again
4491	1	a	microtransaction simulator  10/10 would go bankrupt again
4493	1	a	APB Reloaded to me is one of the best free to play games that you can play, as its not overly difficult to play unless you are really into it, new players can get a few free bonuses like a few free codes to get in game premium so they earn more money and level up quicker with the contacts, the more you play and the better you play the better your skill will get, and the better skill you get the more chance you have of rising in threat level.  There are 5 threat levels, new accounts are T Rank (Trainee) then you have Green threat, which is a player has not won a mission when they leave trainee, then you have bronze which shows that they are not that good at the game, then silver threat which means they are good, but not all the time, then there is gold threat which is someone who is dedicated to the game and never wants to lose and are the most dangerous players to be pitted against if they are max rank in the game which is 255.   It takes a long time to get there, I have spent about 600+ hours on that character and I got her to max rank and gold threat and you can also have a customized character, like my character at this moment looks like she is a paramilitary as she is wearing a big chest rig with some ammo pouches on it, a long sleeved shirt, some cargo pants with knee pads and boots. With any F2P game there are micro transactions, and I fell for it like most have and spent some money on the game, which was a mistake if I am honest as most of my items were bought for me by my clan mates.  the only downside to this game is the amount of people who dislike the game because if the developers and play this game to just purely put in the chat on how bad this game is and putting in a lot of hate comments and sometimes even racial slurs, there is also the downside of the amount of hackers that his game have, itâ€™s rare to find one but they are easy to spot when you find them, and they do get banned after a while but they will come back, and it is also very infuriating when this happens, and another bad thing about APB is that the servers and the game engine don't really like people being on them as there is a lot o lag due to the engine and the servers are also quite bad sometimes as say they are European even though I have 110 MS and it is noticeable
4495	1	a	When you lose, you can mug some people. Best way to chill.
4497	1	a	10% love 90% hate
4499	1	a	best free to play game ever
4501	1	a	44
4503	1	a	good game its just a bit laggy during intense moments for me but ive heard that a ssd fixes that problem (i have a hdd). but apart from this problem its agood game.
4505	1	a	i just got the game and its gr8 and its almost like gta just to tell yeah and its fun
4507	1	a	I love this game but it does run slow but I do recommend this game.
4509	1	a	Personally, I really like this game. It is pretty much a free version of GTA online, but very fun.
4511	1	a	Most addicting game ever!
4513	1	a	Time for a real review, I wrote a review several years ago when i was playing this game. APB Reloaded at the time i was playing it. In a watered down statement is fun, However the game has a New player 'hump' so to speak. That is to say that when you start actually playing the game and not the tutorial portion your going to hate the game. This is because this game is pay to win type game. The more money you pump into the game the easier it will be for you. While i played this game the most i ever did was pay for the premium account for little boosts and i bought a DLC. That didnt increase my performance in the game by much at all. My progress was strictly grinding and finding the weapon class that suited my play style. and figureing out how to counter the wallet warriors of the game. I was very good at the game. as a matter of fact i played so much i nearly finished the origional game contact mission providers which would mean i had unlocked all vanilla content. not the new stuff that the new devs that bought rights to have been adding since. Bottom line, if you dont have the patiance to grind throught this game to get to the point were you can enjoy it then i dont recommend. I will warn you thought you will likely be raging every session and find yourself comming back for more. Thats how i was. GG and Good luck.
4515	1	a	i love this game although its really hard to understand and master i recommend for skilled players and people who can aim very well using a mouse
4517	1	a	It's pretty good but the amount of hackers is really disheartening.
4519	1	a	7.9/10.Bronze district full of high ranks,silver district full of people â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tting that they're a pro colby player and after 2 or 3 days they got banned ayy lmao, and social full of people asking ' can you give me a free car? '. #JustHanServerThings
4521	1	a	yes yes very good, a bit hard to know what to do in the beginning but sure test it out with friends
4523	1	a	Hello,this game is awesome,the customization is epic,it's like an gta 5 for free ;D
4525	1	a	great game this is i like better then gta
4527	1	a	A really cool open world shoot them up and it's basiclly saints row the third mixed with E.A
4529	1	a	OK Game. The graphics are alright, and you have a fun experience.
4531	1	a	Pay To Have Swag.... This will hold me off until gta5 comes to pc.
4533	1	a	Really good and fair game. Without G1C you can do fine(Still be one of top).Report system work. G1C system is good as well because developers need and deserve money(So if you want to be fancy-donate). You can get almost anything for free with game money. Only problem are botters&amp;afk ppl.... they are all over FC:BS and silver districs.
4535	1	a	Everything that's good about this game is also bad about it. Gameplay is very fun and simple, yet incredibly repetitive and plain; the level and weapon system is complex enough to give the player incentive to progress and its not p2w either, but at some point you're gonna understand that there's only 5 different missions in the game and you're doing the same sh*t over and over. Customization is one of the best out there, but guess what, you have to pay real $$$ to get the cool clothing items and customization slots.   At the end of the day though, there's no real reason not to try it. It is fun to play with friends, it is very competitive yet easy, and it also happens to be free to play.
4537	1	a	A game not without its flaws. However, when you have a good team together that is in communication, its a fun game, and now that its free to play well worth checking out.
4539	1	a	Is a fun game best to play with friends
4541	1	a	A Free Grand Theft auto like game were you can be a Cop or a Crim I recormend it for GTA Fans
4543	1	a	Matchmaking is just bad - you're teamed up against fully elite and decked out players at a low level Drug mules are good I guess, grab it and run, if you try to fight, prepare to get one shot Addictive game, fully customization options, create your own death ringtone (when you kill someone else) Ability to get a perm gun when you play the game up to a certain level (low lvl)
4545	1	a	Played it for a bit. Awesome once you play it for a while but throughout you'll always meet p2w players with better gear.
4547	1	a	It's a great game! really addicting sometimes :P
4549	1	a	This game is fun but you need to spend a lot of money if you want to play good. ( PAY TO WIN )
4551	1	a	I hit my friend with a car.   10/10
4553	1	a	Its a fun time kill, some aspects are a little clunky but not hard to overlook. Customization is fun
4555	1	a	  its a good game but we need a motorbike and a bus and a plane and a tank and a aircarft
4557	1	a	Love it man just need a good net and a pc but i love this game since gta 5 hasnt released for pc its like a replacement :D
4559	1	a	5/5 would flip my 4x4 vegas again
4561	1	a	Loved this before and after f2p great game with friends
4563	1	a	Its ok.
4565	1	a	this game is a great conscept, and has a ton of potensual.though this game is not as great as it can be.the game has long load times and,though its probably just my computer,is laggy as crap(if crap could lagg).driving is terribal,i cant even sterr strait.the games missions are confusing,and i can never figure out what i was doing.  there are a lot of good things the game.customization is great,there are a lot things to do with the money you earn in missions, and there are many optians for combat,not just shooting at the bad guy.you can get in a car with someone else and shoot out the window,though the driver cant.you can get on top of most building in the game in some way,which is great for flanking.  the game has a lot of flaughs,but it still is good.i recommend the game mostly because its free.dont get the game for a slow computer like me,but if you can,get the game.  6/10
4567	1	a	good but needs to have some drug smugling like the way GTA chinatown wars did it the game would be superb!! other than that keep it up game DEV.s
4569	1	a	Probaby one of the funniest new games ive tried. Really has a endless amount of stuff to do and enjoy in this game. Have yet to get bored of it and I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a good FPS
4571	1	a	i think i would like it but my laptop cant run it
4573	1	a	This game although old is very fun and easy to get into. You start with 2 of the best wpns in game and through progression obtain any weapon, car, clothing you would need to sucessful w/o spending and RL money. I would recommend this to anyone who likes shooter games. I have over 600 hours so far in the game and still enjoy it (played a bit outside of Steam)
4575	1	a	 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APB:_Reloadedi :  APB: All Points Bulletin is a multiplayer online video game for Microsoft Windows based in urban sprawls and featuring two factions, Enforcers and the Criminals. Players can join either the Enforcers or the Criminals, and form sub-groups in either faction. The game design was led by David Jones, who contributed to the original Grand Theft Auto and Crackdown, and was developed by Realtime Worlds. It was released on 6 June 2010 in North America, and Europe.  On 17 August 2010 Realtime Worlds was placed into administration. The administrators intended to keep the company trading whilst they attempted to find a buyer for the firm. If a buyer could not be found then the long-term future for the game was uncertain. On 16 September 2010 Realtime Worlds announced APB servers were to be shut down 'soon' with no specific date given. On 11 November 2010 online games company, K2 Network, purchased APB for Â£1.5 million. No time frame for re-release or reactivation of servers was announced. On 16 November 2010 K2 subsidiary company Reloaded Productions, announced that APB will be relaunched during the first half of 2011 as a free to play game, renamed APB: Reloaded. ----------  I bought the game so I was bummed when they ended up tanking, I found it worth the money, but it was good news that they found someone to pass the torch to. Even though being f2p it is mainly for aesthetics and permanent guns but you can still purchase the same weapons that last temporarily with in-game money you earn from missions and killing other players and still have customizable things you can earn to make your character look unique which I believe is very in depth. One of the coolest things about this game is the ability to create your own artwork with shapes and various tools which some people can create some of the coolest detailed things with to apply to clothing and your own personal vehicles.   I highly recommend it given that it is the best f2p game in this genre like GTA available and the combat is challenging and action packed with grenade throwing, vehicles exploding, and bullets flying. It is even possible to place players on the criminal faction 'under arrest' with stun gun weapons and hand cuffs can earn more points. It is also hilariously humiliating to them and you can often hear them curse over the built in VOIP which makes it even better to feel like you've put scum in it's place.
4577	1	a	Ok so I have been kind of addicted to this game for over a year now. Its my first venture into a true PVP game. The community is ok once you find other players willing to help teach you the game and play along your side until you get the mechanics figured out. The match making is pretty bad and there are alot of people who play in zones where they don't belong (you will have issues with getting killed alot and not getting many kills when you start) out once you figure it out and you keep in the back of your mind that this is only a game and you don't rage quit it turns out to be pretty good.
4579	1	a	really fun with team mates :)
4581	1	a	Even though it looks similar to GTA, this game is unique and has a lot of potential.  Too bad, the servers are made of potatoes, the developers are the worms and the community is the salt on top.  I have been playing for about 5 years from now. An indie team could have done a better job on this game in 6 months, than the current development team in all those years.  Communication with the team is a joke. Their so called 'Community manager' posts about :  -10 nonsense comments about horses,   -4 empty patch notes,   -1 excuse why are they still not making progress with the engine upgrade,  -dozens of newly added premium stuff, they happen to create while the server room is on fire  I am still recommending the game, because the content itself is great. It's only the team behind it that su..ks. If I could I would give them 0 stars. 
4583	1	a	got my account back! very happy
4585	1	a	Old, Framerate problems, broken, unbalanced, salty community.  ...     I LOVE IT!
4587	1	a	Best game 11/10 Thanks g1 for good quality game. Only g1c i hate its fookin expensive .-.
4589	1	a	10/10. Everyone is a hacker but i keep comin back.     ....Help me
4591	1	a	Really fun
4593	1	a	I do not recomend player who play APB on laptop! If you not ok with 5-10FPS and have the worst lag ever. I had play 1000h on laptop and since I update to a stationary PC I never had a single lag never a froze not even today. Buuuuuuuuuut its a ok game 6.5/10 :)
4595	1	a	Big Guns, Large Scale Shootouts, Fast Cars, and Total Anarchy?   F*CK YEAH!!! This is a great game for the ones who like guns, Cars, And (Gang?) Warfare.   On my pc (i5), the game lacks a miniscule amount of frames.   It takes a it to run, but overall,    IT'S A DAMN GREAT GAME!     - 419NigerianPrinceEA  (Please don't send me your EA username &amp; Password It's just a joke)
4597	1	a	Not much to say, addicting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.
4599	1	a	The worlds truly most addictive game.
4601	1	a	IDK I NEVER GOT INTO IT THATS PROBABLY A SIGN!!!! DUDUNDDDNUDNUDNDUNd
4603	1	a	Something about this game makes me feel like I am worse at it now than I was when I first started playing APB. But all in all it's good fun and just roaming around in cool rides( or crashing into every single obstalce) and getting dragged into missions makes it a 8/10 game.
4605	1	a	i have real big mixed opineons with this game imm not going to lie. but heres something they need to tweak: dont make it p2w, make gold players go to gold servers (same with silver and bronze) but other than thoes 2 things its a real solid game 7/10
4607	1	a	Its Gta Online 
4609	1	a	Meh, got it to play with a mate, plus its free so cant complain.
4611	1	a	very fun game. the connection does get a litte ehhhh. but other than that its great. i hope that they put money into making the servers and connections to the game better. if you are reading this, hit download.......
4613	1	a	I've played this game for upwards of three hundred hours, take heed. This could very easily turn into the most rage inducing game you have EVER played. Take a slot machine, shove inside a random number generator, and then draw a chance card from a Monopoly game and you'll know how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t the missions in this game can unfold. IF you don't take winning seriously, this games customization alone will keep you occupied.
4615	1	a	you should play even if you have no time!
4617	1	a	a very fun game of cops and robbers, sometimes frustraiting with the pay-to-win method of the game but its fun all over all teamgame.
4619	1	a	One of the greatest games i've ever played. People whine about pay2win, but that's only noobs and low lvls. At a higher level, that isn't even hard to obtain from just having fun and playing without paying anything, you will notice the free weapons you buy from apb$ is just as good as the ones you can purchase for real money.   Original apb 5/5 Reloaded 4/5 - Everything is nice, but the graphics engine is really messed up. But they will soon release a new one and i will start playing this game again.
4621	1	a	This game is very great i love it.
4623	1	a	Great game i would recommend to anyone
4625	1	a	I've been playing APB reloaded for about 100+hours so far its not that bad i find it quiet fun, if you arent that skilled it could be a complain on match making, im alright with this since i usually get 2k score rating im inbetween gold/silver ranking. To me its not bad at all nothing wrong with it, yes some weapons are OP in Weapon shop which could be considered Pay to win, but i found after i get upgraded stock weapons that usually comes to Tactics and which weapon is equiped but mostly on tactic it self, i killed and won over many Pay to wins.   To me try it out see how it goes dont give up so fast, you must be pretty good at games like a proper 'gamer' good with progression, people who have just started gaming or havent played much of these type of games would find this game abit challenging. How you tell your doing any good is if your getting better scores they do and over 1k score rating and going up most matches, winning.etc barely dieing. those type of things.  Give it a shot, if your good with it its never a problem with match making at all Also adding - stock weapons are pretty good, i still own golds and silvers with it, not really your weapon, tactic/dodge.etc is the aim i do, i even try crouching time to time. Also a tip you should see if they have any perks like Blood clotting and more armor on them selfs, and change your tactic towards that 1 person, usually for the more armored and slow, i usually fire abit and hit them and reload as quick as possible, then full on kill them with the means to kill them.   Also dont go to Hong Kong server as it isnt in 'hong kong' its more in USA side, also it doesnt have many people in it. so i disagree ever going that server. Give it a shot Gamer!
4627	1	a	I like this game because its very good action, more than more weapon, and its pretty!
4629	1	a	Good game not as good as a GTA but i still give it a thumbs up but the only problem is the 30 mins it takes to load it.
4631	1	a	1 little baby â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tap of your car, can kill someone   10/10
4633	1	a	Nice game. This is in my top 3 list :D
4635	1	a	Good game, but seriously needs improvement. Just because it's unique, only one of its kind in the MMO genre, that I continue to play it.  6/10  
4637	1	a	Awsome game!!!!!!!!!!
4639	1	a	This is a good game.
4641	1	a	If you like game such as gta well this is the game for you , you can be cops or the criminals insanely fun however its a bit of pay to win but if your looking for a bit of fun this is for you.
4643	1	a	very good and nice to play.
4645	1	a	This game is kind of like a Grand Theft Auto game, exept only online. Not as much freedom as GTA but fun as hell to play with friends
4647	1	a	Can you guys make it on PS3 as Play-For-Free?
4649	1	a	Hit the streets as a licensed vigilante or hardened criminal in the crime-ravaged metropolis of San Paro where shootouts, car-chases, robbery, and vandalism are all in a day's work. Prove yourself to your chosen organization and you could earn fame, deadly weapons, exotic vehicles, and stylish new clothing; fail.But is too cool
4651	1	a	Best game in the world!
4653	1	a	Awesome game, funny to play, good staff , mixed things to do 10/10 ;)
4655	1	a	Its awfully balanced and the guns that you pay for are clearly better than the ones you get by just playing. Yet i keep coming back to it
4657	1	a	Great online FPS and Driving simulator combined into some unforgettable PvP action. Cars exploding during missions and a true cops versus robbers feel. 100 people per zone at once, so great feel of a live city during combat.
4659	1	a	it like GTA only some players can be cops the other criminals you can steal cars find and use weapons it awesome
4661	1	a	Relly good game, i like it, i tell my friends for the game and they started playing.
4663	1	a	Good: Missions are fun, team work, yay Bad:Pay to win kinda game
4665	1	a	APB reloaded is Very Closely related to GTA however it is far from it. The game can be fun with a team or group of friends. The team Is Highly Pay to win though. People whom Pay for Prem get Everything just about and Is/are able to have better weapons and when 2xs more money in game to get things. The biggest Issue with the game is team Balance. There is none. You get matched up with people that are WAY higher ranked then you're self and they Expect you to deal with the fact that that have Armor on and BEtter weapons that wipe you out in a heartbeat. Would I recommend the game yes but For more of a casual play on occasion sorta thing
4667	1	a	At first, I was a little sceptical about how good and fun this game would be. I've received various feedbacks from my friends about this game and not too many of those feedbacks got me interested in downloading this game.  Nevertheless, I thought to myself, 'I cannot make irrelevant assumptions based on peoples' opinions and perspectives.' And I've got to say I'm glad i downloaded APB Reloaded. I've been playing the game for well over 30 hours now. And i have seen some complains about hackers spoiling all the fun. Well from what i see, there are not many hackers. I rarely face any of them when i'm playing. The gun play might not be the best, but it surely is A WHOLE LOT OF FUN. And not to mention the ability to customize your character and vehicles. It is simply outstanding.  The only thing that bothers me about APBB is the driving. Well, i have always been experiencing 2 second delays when i hit the 'A' and 'D' buttons to turn left and right in my vehicle. That is pretty much the only thing i have to complain about. Besides that, i have no complains whatsoever.   So, if any of you guys are still pondering whether to download APB, pondeer no longer. It is a great Free-To-play game. The only thing you have to get used to is driving. It only takes a metter of time to practice a little and you'll be fine and dandy. DOWNLOAD APB!! IT IS AMAZING
4669	1	a	i cant seem to load it up 
4671	1	a	this online game is fun and there is always something to do like if your and police officer you chase down criminals and if your a criminal you steal,kill,destroy etc... could be better in graphics but apart from that its a fun game to play. If i had to rate this game out of 10 i would give it a 8
4673	1	a	It has nice graphics and all but the citizens are wierd lookings has a lot of bugs like the bug that i have that its like a screen multi color thing but i reccomend it
4675	1	a	its cool
4677	1	a	is so epic game try to play that so epic!
4679	1	a	its like an mmo gta. the missions are challenging. and it is 110% necessary to use teamwork. ive only been playing for a little while but i love it.  my only problem is the premuim option. i feel that some of the stuff that is not available to f2p player gives little rich kids an unfair advantage.  but the game is truly amazing :)
4681	1	a	/=
4683	1	a	In a Nutshell:  APB Reloaded is all I wanted from the original title before it went under and more.   The game is GTA Online on Steroids
4685	1	a	Very fun with friends! Please try this! 
4687	1	a	I love it. But not when people are 'Hacking' It just gets annoying when they kill you some how.. But other than that good game
4689	1	a	Best game I played tnx for upgrading this game and makeing this game good
4691	1	a	i dunno man, this reminds me of Saints Row + Gta
4693	1	a	That game.... Developer claims its 'Free to play' , but its a pay to win... but its fun when you play agains 'normal' players ^_^
4695	1	a	Ã¿
4697	1	a	Great customization and average gameplay. Great for dicking around with your friends.
4699	1	a	just making this to annoy my friends

4741	1	a	This is a fun but also repetitive and dont play this game if you hate pay to wins
4743	1	a	it cools
4745	1	a	its a fun game but i think its a bit pay to win.
4747	1	a	Best online 3PS game by now
4749	1	a	it is fun 
4751	1	a	APB RELOADED is one of the best online multiplayer game i have ever played! This game is manely fun with your freinds but dont let that stop you from getting this game, the game is still fun without friends all im saying is when you are playing with friends on this game you pee yourself in laughter even more than you do on your own playing this game. I like how you can creat and customize your charecter and make yourself look like a complete BADASS, also you can even customize your own car to make just as equally as BADASS as your charecter. You get a choice of being a Emfocer or a crimanal, you can pick diffrent districs and locations to spawn at and also you can even make your own group or join a group. There is so much good things to say about this game but i will just end it with this.......of the few hours i have been playing this game i have fell in love with it i like this game more than anyother game i own or have now. WARNING THIS GAME MAY BECOME ADDICTIVE!
4753	1	a	This game is da sauc.
4755	1	a	The best Online game in the free for all class !!!!! its hours of fun :D !
4757	1	a	it's free so dont complane if you dont like it.But i love this game free and it's really fun.The lag can be a problem sometimes but i can deal with that
4759	1	a	I Love This Game I Watched My BRO! Play This Now I Play This And Love! It :D 10/10 :D
4761	1	a	Great game in my opinion ... :3
4763	1	a	The matchmaking is bad but the game is AWESOME. Just try it,rarely hackers.       9/10
4765	1	a	THERE ARE LOG IN BUGS PLEASE FIX
4767	1	a	I really like this game but the new engine â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up the game, so many new updates
4769	1	a	This game still exists?
4771	1	a	I just mess up all the other people's stuff, like 1. he parked down his car next to the mission building 2. I crash into his car 3. everybody yays   oh me :(
4773	1	a	You Want a cool looking avatar you need to spen at least three hours on it. you want a cool car 5 hours plus some money. you want to win? you either give up your life savings or your whole life
4775	1	a	Basically GTA: Online but with more general customization and less graphic capability and... the physics are not as good as GTA: Online's.
4777	1	a	Yes, i have a lot of fun playing this game. Should be better with friends but i didnt play with any.
4779	1	a	The only game I know where I can customize my car to be hot pink with SWAG written in bold print on the front and play bumper cars inside the parking lot.  Everything else is poor mans GTA in MMO form.
4781	1	a	Very good, love the gameplay
4783	1	a	APB Reloaded was honestly one of the best worst games I've ever played, i mean its so good. if you like good games, then you can start by not playing APB reloaded, its the worst game. but you should give it a try.
4785	1	a	wow much shooter
4787	1	a	I am so addicted to this game. If I could afford to, I would skip work to play this all night tonight and all day tomorrow. Simply amazing!
4789	1	a	It's best Game...download and play it.  It's Funny xD  E na figata scaricalo e provalo
4791	1	a	One of the best 3rd person shooters I've ever played, lots of fun in a massive city!
4793	1	a	It's good dumb fun. The matchmaking tries its hardest to put you against people your skill level, so don't fret if you're terrible, you'll be put against those who are as well. :)  It's a decent game, I'd suggest it to those who want to goof around and customize their character to all hell.  Wish it had a decent roleplay community, sadly.. no.
4795	1	a	This game is amazing in every way. I recommend it because it is one of the best shooters out there, lets you customize anything you really want to: Cars, Character, Clothes Etc. If you're into the CoD series, you just might like this game although its not really like CoD, it's fast paced battles with Enforcers, (Cops) Versus Criminals. This game is not, however P2W(PaytoWin), but if you do play it P2W you might have an advantage over other players. This game has been INFESTED with hackers lately, I would not reccomend it Atm(At the moment).  I currently have an R229 Criminal on Colby(NA WEST) The name is SeemsLegitBro
4797	1	a	i think game APB reloaded so good and I verry like game.
4799	1	a	kinda bad graffics but good game play
4801	1	a	...
4803	1	a	Its not Pay 2 Win , at first i thought so but if u spend some time in the game look up some methods to gain money everything is buyable
4805	1	a	Hell of a game. mugging, robbing, and missions. Own this now.
4807	1	a	Very fun game, sometimes the premiums and hackers can be asses, but all in all it's a recommendable game for friends to play ^^
4809	1	a	use Apeed Volcano JC + Oca Nano    -Ezy win ezy life
4811	1	a	APB Reloadeed will give a hard time to newbies, it's best to start with friends which are higher level, but overall, without the hackers and stuff, it's a pretty good game !
4813	1	a	'HAHAHA! HOLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ BALLS! DID YOU SEE THAT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ EXPLODE?' - You, after playing APB for 30 minutes.
4815	1	a	This game is one of the best open-world games out there. It is often compared to GTA, but it is so much more than that. It has fully customizable characters and cars, big open-world map, and a social district completely for your customization needs. This game is way better than the way the people on here are making it out to be. It's free, so give it a try. You don't like it, your loss.
4817	1	a	This game is oodles of fun. But don't let that mask the greediness of the people of Gamers First. Yes this game does intail all that it says. But you have to 'pay' for more then half of them. Customization, Permement and Exclusive Guns, Cash and Progression (Exp) bonuses, Car Parts, Symbol creation, and I'm sure there is lots more you will find.   Premium (Which entails Bonus Cash and EXP, Symbol/Car Customisation and... I think that's it.) costs 799 G1 credits which ammounts to 10$ US total. But that I beleive is the beta price. Because the image has a 1199 (15$ US) crossed out in the back which makes the current price a special and assuming it doesn't last until it's fully released.  Permament/Premium guns. Guns can range in price from 17$ all the way up to 60$. 60 Dollars! I cannot fathom who decided to begin the price range like that, but for G1 to agree on it takes the cake. These guns are character bound. So if you want a gun on your Criminal and Enforcer then your lookin at 120
4819	1	a	This game i really cool but always the same thing happening everyday i play it's the same missions and not much to do but walk around and wait for a mission to come (would probs be the same mission you just did) but if ur really into art and love to create and costomsize the game has alot to offer with that i go through dissusions and see very cool emblems and character's or if u love killing idc c:.... i like it doe
4821	1	a	ITS SWEET BETTER THEN ALL THE GTAs.
4823	1	a	i havent played alot of this but it seems good but the matchmaking snt fair
4825	1	a	Alright, this is definitely going to be one of the more...odd reviews I'll have written, but APB is an odd game in the end. Here's how it goes: in the beginning, right when you start out, you'll be a trainee who knows nothing about the game except for what the tutorials show you how to do. And, more than likely, on your first mission, you'll be run over (both figuratively and probably literally) quite heavily. And, if you only get to play this game a little, with no connection to the forums or people to show you the ropes, you'll have a hard time actually getting good at the game.   The skill gradient in this game is intense and impossibly cruel, as you'll have to figure out things on your own all the while being trashed by your enemies, not to mention the learning curve. As with any game, there are some mechanics that you have to learn by doing, but in a game so diverse and deep as this (yes, it does have a definite deepness to it), there will be some mechanics that aren't overtly intuited by your gameplay, which makes the gameplay even more frustrating.   And, to speak of frustration, there will definitely be a lot of it. From the people using better guns, better strategies, better teamwork, and all around better gameplay, to your lack of knowledge of the game, there will be an intense amount of frustration on your end, mostly due to how -unfair- it all seems. Indeed, I know how it is. It took me up to rank 200 (out of a possible 255 ranks currently) to generally get good with about 75% of the game in total. And, on top of all that, you'll get the odd hacker here and there which will be upsetting for the people who're trying to play fairly, if only to add to the mess.  And yet, do I reccommend this game? I'm certainly wavering hesitantly over those two buttons down there, trying to decide if I -do- want more people to experience the game or if they should simply stay the hell away. It's really a tough choice, let me tell you.  After all, there are some redeeming parts to this game. The social aspect, if you get into it, can be enjoyable. The idiots in district chat are always there to be taunted if they get pissy about a game they lost, or if they're generally being stupid, and there are the charismatic teammates in the game that really make you enjoy a particular mission you're on. You could end up in a large clan where you get to play with a great amount of people with varied playstyles, or even make some good friends in the game and join their clan of a small, yet tightly knit, group.  To add to that, there's a large amount of variance in this game, meaning there's a huge number of guns and subsequent variations of from which to choose, along with cars and clothing, all of which can be customised to some extent. And, if you add to that the possibility of Premium accounts, then you add more slots for customisation. On top of even all that is ARMAS, which houses a plethora of guns that can only be attained fully by purchasing them, along with custom parts for some cars, and purchase-only clothing parts and gear. (That's the Pay2Win part of the game.) In reality, most of the ARMAS guns are there for the people who don't want to wait to unlock weapons in the game, or people who don't want to shell out in-game money every ten days for the guns they regularly use. Almost every weapon in the game is good enough and viable to play, as long as you match the gun to the situation it's prime in. Protip: don't be good or favour any one gun; try and be skillful with all of them.  In the end...I think I would reccommend this game to you. Yes, it lags. Yes, there are some hackers. Yes, it's difficult, and yes, the client crashes 10 percent of the time, but...I think it's something I want you to experience. It's something you can get addicted to easily, whether or not you enjoy it. All in all, I think it's a decent enough game.   So, give it a try. Put in about 500 hours worth of time, and then see if you want to quit it.   ~Kuro  -------------------------------- Tips: -Learn to tap-fire. Most guns are useless if you spray full-auto. -Starting gun 'Star556' is strong already if you know how to tap-fire. NTEC is also beastly; It's not called 'wintec' for nothing. -Make a max-height character to see the whole hitbox. All characters share the same hitbox size, so even if your body is fully behind cover as a small person, your hitbox might not be. -Play on bronze servers; Silver is full of highly-skilled players and hackers. -If you want Premium from ARMAS, don't buy only premium. Get a Joker box bundle. Chances are you'll get some nifty guns as well as premium codes in there. -Look up weapon guides, car guides, and code lists in the Steam 'help guides' that are available. They'll help to show you what's decent for which situation. -Gold servers are empty. No one goes there. You won't get opposition. Don't waste your time entering them.
4827	1	a	pay to win like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, fun as hell for about a week then it gets repetitive.
4829	1	a	Sometimes you just want to drive around with sirens on and thats pretty much why I keep playing lol. Besides that though its just fun to run around do missions with friends and taunting other players over the mic. Sometimes you even make friends with the competition! Also the customization options are amazing and why I fell in love with this game in the first place back since the Realtime World days. The possibilities are endless as long as you have the imagination for it.
4831	1	a	I ran someone over and they flew up into the air. 20/10
4833	1	a	Such a great game, play it, I recomend it!
4835	1	a	i really like this game as a free alternate of Grand Theft Auto and some parts of the Newesat game to the Ubisoft Librtary,Watchdogs,really fun
4837	1	a	This game is soo much fun, although there are stuff that could be fix to make it alot better but of course still is fun to play with friends and make friends also!
4839	1	a	Very fun game with cars of your own! I recromend it to all my friends who like to customize their cars and add parts to it!
4841	1	a	nice game but there is too many hackers...
4843	1	a	It's the multiplayer version of cops and robbers you've always wanted. It almost feels like it's pay to win, but it totally isn't.
4845	1	a	Fun game, like a cheap/ low budget version of GTA.
4847	1	a	I have just one question. How hard is it to make controller support? very shameful
4849	1	a	This is A very good Game everyone should get this
4851	1	a	Excellent Graphics, Interesting Concept, Hard to learn Gameplay. The gameplay for me is quite confusing and even after as much as I have played it, I mainly just get killed. I don't know if it just me but definitely give the game a try as it can be quite entertaining if you learn to play.
4853	1	a	Great game &lt;3
4855	1	a	this game is great. Its like an online GTA. Its free aswell so its even better. Play as cop or criminal and roam the streets doing missions and killing eachother
4857	1	a	APB Reloaded is a fast paced, shoot em up, Free to play, open world strategy combat MMO; and if you are any good at it, you hate it with a passion.   I recommend it.
4859	1	a	APB Reloaded is a game with a classic setting - cops versus crooks. It is a very fast paced open world shooter. The game is very simple and fairly easy to learn, but like most things, hard to master. When you enter the game you create your charater. You have a lot of customization options. A lot. After that, you will expirience a lot of wierd moments, where you will not know what you are doing. But when you actually grasp the game logic, you will start to have a lot of fun, but again, it does tend to 'punish' those who lose missions. But, the gameplay isn't even close to why the game is so much fun. When you enter the social district, you get to costumize your charater at various kiosks around the map. You can costumize all from your charater, to their clothes and even their car. But then again, you do need to buy premium for further costumization (Premium costs around 15â‚¬). When you feel you know your way around the game, you will want to join a clan. Clans in this game don't add much meaning to the game, other than the name, and possibly a clan event here and there. But it is an amazing way to meet new people, to play with. Some clans even tend to have clan colours or even clan clothing. The game does lack weapon balancing (the armas gold weapons are a lot of times a lot better when being hold by a - so called pro) and it does (at times) have a big number of aimbot and wallhack hackers, which ruin the mood. The game servers aren't the best and you do need a good system to play it without fps lags. Also, the people in the game are a lot of times â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s and can ruin your mood. Don't let them! The game is a lot of fun once you know what you are doing and the costumization is amazing - one of the best in mmo games. Overall, it is worth a shot.
4861	1	a	A lot like GTA, but not quite, it is the best GTA resembled game I've ever played.
4863	1	a	The Closest Thing We Have To A GTA MMO. -F4ST3STGAMING
4865	1	a	If you wanna have fun in an open world game this is what you want!
4867	1	a	awesome game but as too many lag
4869	1	a	Not best but could play when bored
4871	1	a	The best crime warfare !!! Weapons and outfits are no limits. Open-world and cool online missions can replace GTA V! { Just only my opinion. Sorry if you're GTA fan }
4873	1	a	I drove a car, exploded, then respawned and got ran over by a dude playing mylie cyrius, i came in like a wrecking ball. 11 out of 10, would be explode again.
4875	1	a	While the character creator, theme song composer and the car/tattoo/clothing/logo customisation is top-notch, the lack of a true PvE venue of advancement might be a turnoff for some fans of traditional well rounded MMO experiences. If you love MMOs mainly for the PvP and competitive aspect however, then this is a really solid modern setting title that has decent replay value.  I reccomend you grab a friend before heading out on the town, it is easy to get overwhelmed quickly without some backup!
4877	1	a	I recommend anyone who likes online games and a relatively large arsenal of weapons...
4879	1	a	Always been one of my favorite f2p games.
4881	1	a	cool game
4883	1	a	Strongly recommend this game.  Possibly the highest customization you'll ever see in a free PC game, ranging from character appearance to car appearance to weapon appearance. Strong and intense gun fights, strategic play, teamwork, open-world, you can have fun when you're not even in a mission, collect items, patterns for your customization, parts for your cars, new guns, make your own theme song for when you kill someone, maybe you want to dazzle them with your impressive skills or maybe just completely annoy someone by using an annoying tone such as the mario death theme or the trololol song. The horizons of this game are only known by your creativity and skill. You want to use a car as a ramp and jump out mid-air and blow your enemies up with a rocket launcher? You got it! You want to stun groups of enemies, arrest them and dance around them while they're left defenseless and waiting for the timer to run out so they can respawn? You got it! You want to joyride? Got it! Want to steal items and cars to make money from them? Got it! Are you a enforcer? You can't steal? Who says you can't? Ram a criminal's car into a store and those items are yours to pick up, unless you want the criminal to put them in his car first and then steal his car with the rest of his stolen items, you can turn them in for cash too, just like they can. Want to host a huge group and muck around in the social district? YOU CAN. Want to voice chat to your team and other people nearby? YOU CAN. You want to tag your customized graffiti on a billboard? YOU CAN. You want statues of yourself? HAVE THEM. Whether you want to be good or bad, or a mix of both, there's something in this game for everyone, except for maybe children and pregnant women, well maybe pregnant women are okay, idk, go into labour and let your kid's first words be 'Hey brudda' ~ Wilson LeBoyce.
4885	1	a	Pretty Legit
4887	1	a	This is the most vile pile crap ever made for pc. Its a virtual sewer if there ever was one. The people in this game are very helpful. And by helpful i mean they will help you  Die and Lose missions by blocking your car or placeing their own vehicle over the drop zone. And great freinds who will kill you as soon as look at you. And of coarse everyone has something nice to say. Usually lots of kind words that happen to have only 4 letters. Any way ... if your head is not in a toilet somewhere go ahead and get this game. its awsome.
4889	1	a	Where do I even start with is game. you got guns. you got hip hop. and you got customization like you wouldnt even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing think possible. this game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. you even wanna roll 4 deep with some homies and just shoot up â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? well in this game you can. need I say more?
4891	1	a	Wasn't expecting this game to be so enjoyable
4893	1	a	This is game is a pretty good game but they could make changes to make it better.   -The responding time when you're driving is not fast enough -Hackers are starting to dominate the game -Broken spawn points -Skin texture issues when you load up -Can be boring sometimes, repetive missions  -Finding a mission takes a while because barely anyone plays this anymore -They should add bikes  -The Asylum thing has not been open for a while, that game mode made the game really intense and exciting -Laggy as hell  I stopped playing this game because it became really dull and worthless but if you like free roam,action games then try this game out.
4895	1	a	Awesome GTA styled game. Crazy fun.
4897	1	a	Honestly gta 1 was better than this.
4899	1	a	Boss of a game!
4901	1	a	i cant download it can any body help me with the instructions :(
4903	1	a	the game never starts right but when it does start it says not responding and it shows that the game froze but i can still hear the audio, can someone please help me  
4905	1	a	it is hoorrrible trash.it keeps saying i need the D3D9 device or something.and, i cant even play on ONE server because it says i need some device or whatever. so my rating is negative 1 out of ten.
4907	1	a	It wont start when i open the game it says the game is down for a maintrance. I have no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing clue what so ever how to fix it. this is to Gamersfirst. so i have nothing to say about this game, hope you guys like it B cus i cant...
4909	1	a	This is like gta4 cops and robbers mode excpet you get to actually break into houses and customize your character
4911	1	a	Recommended
4913	1	a	I wish it was a Mac Os game also.
4915	1	a	APB (All Points Bulletin), the first online game developed by David Jones, the creator of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is a massively multiplayer online game based in living, breathing cities that will feel familiar to players, as they precisely replicate famous cities all over the world. APB is a turf war involving two main factions, the Squads, whose goal is to uphold the law, and the Gangs, who seek to break the law at all costs. Players will be able to choose their side, in a classic good guy versus bad guy scenario.
4917	1	a	seems really interesting so anyone wanna try it with me? 
4919	1	a	Not sure if I can say yes or no to this game. Full of griefers, full of rude people but so damn addictive... Just one more mission all the time.. I've been up all night on this. Gameplay incredibly unbalanced for PvP but still addictive. I have both criminal and enforcer. I probably spend more time in the designer than the game.  The intro movie makes you want to play it... the really crap player matching makes you want to throw your pc out the window. Too much microtransactions IMO but I have blown Â£100 on it so far just to have a few cool bits... its no different than subbing WoW for 10 months so why not. Its worth a shot if you HAVE THE PATIENCE and don't care about losing so some tool who has a grenade launcher in a n00b mission.
4921	1	a	Very Good Game. Kindam pay to win, but still you ca have lots of fun when you are skilled to use the starter weapon.a
4923	1	a	This is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nice game! xD
4925	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME! this game is beautiful, you can create your own cars and characters, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT! APB Reloaded is one of those games where 80% of people have spent alot of money buying cars and weapons which are OP, this makes the game hard to play at times because you are put up against people who can kill you with one shot. it would be cool if you could choose to verse people that are your level and have the same guns as you, so you are not getting demolished by the people who pay to win. But if you dont mind getting killed with one shot well this is the game for you! It is fun to just get your car and Drag Race your friends or Random people, and cause Havoc on the streets with you Dump Truck, speeding along the roads blowing up everything in your path. I would rate this game a 8/10 because of its massive selection of cars and weapons, and the amount of fun you can have with it!
4927	1	a	Makes me moist in my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
4929	1	a	addicted to this game probs my best game around at the moment cant keep off it
4931	1	a	Awesomely fun! Unlock guns cars and more! Free to play also!
4933	1	a	F2P. Awesome game.
4935	1	a	This game is really fun, if you enjoyed the Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row series, you'll LOVE this game, it pure multiplayer meaning there is no 'bots' only other players to fight against. Give it a try. It's free!
4937	1	a	this is nice game
4939	1	a	No, I actually canÂ´t recommend this game to anyone. In the beginning youÂ´ll get kill-farmed by the veterans, the mission design is repetitive and the community is the worst IÂ´ve ever seen. Still, IÂ´ve played almost 450 hours with my two chars, so there has to be something with this game... Enjoy!^^
4941	1	a	i would really recommend this game for players of the crackdown and crackdown 2 xbox 360 games because there really alike 
4943	1	a	if you dont care about hacker and if you dont rage at this game you are not human
4945	1	a	Not as much as a Pay2Win as most of the other Free to plays but paying players will always be noticable. Gameplay can get a little confusing and frustrating with the lack of instruction. My biggest issue is that this game is a UI NIGHTMARE. I still have not yet figured out how to customize cars and characters. Firing weapons on full auto just makes the spread continuously grow and does not slow/stop between shots unless you lay off the trigger. Every car that is customized by the player lacks responsive steering severely but will improve when giving gas through corners, kind of like a reverse GTA4 handling (Cars in GTA4 are responsive but handle like garbage). I don't feel like I would recommend it but it does not deserve a not recommend.
4947	1	a	It is like a mixture of GTA and Crimecraft. Except more badass!
4949	1	a	Difficult to get into, even as a vetern to shooters. Lots of customisation and tons of gameplay potential, ruined by the focus on payments and korean level grinding.  It's mainly an mmo and the limited player TDM is squashed by that fact.
4951	1	a	I like this game. I really do. If any of you want to play it as a cop please let me know because sadly it is a game that takes more than one person to play right.
4953	1	a	Basically GTA f2p
4955	1	a	Awesome Game :P
4957	1	a	This game is pretty fun for free it's very good. The customization has a wide variety from things to choose and unlock from. If you are interested into a free roaming fun time download this.
4959	1	a	I love this game and always will :)
4961	1	a	Simply Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4963	1	a	It has major freezing problems
4965	1	a	An entertaining rage game, I find. Taps into very strong team playing skills when versing strong or large teams. Some missions might have the same objectives but will never play out the same way, the wide range of guns and play styles insures that no 'camp spot' is impossible to defeat. Orgainzation and teamwork can win any fight, you just need to be more orgainzed and strong team then the opposition. Even with team mates the occational hacker can make the game tiring. Can also be demanding on older computers as I recently fixed! XD
4967	1	a	AWESOME GAME JUST LIKE GRAND THEFT AUTO GET IT NOW
4969	1	a	This game is like a Free GTA, plus more
4971	1	a	Best free to play shooter
4973	1	a	This game is great fun and you easily get hooked to it. Both maps are amazing and teamwork strives in this game. The customization is epic and will get you editing you characted/cars for hours. The major problem to this game is that it is a pay to win, if you are going to spend some money, think twice.
4975	1	a	The game is realy cool but not everybody have the graphic you need a strong computer but it s realy cool
4977	1	a	All Points Bulletin has improved drastically from its original launch but isn't necessarily the MMO Grand Theft Auto we've been looking for.
4979	1	a	The best game I've probably ever played, and one that consumes all my time. A new kind of MMOTPS. It's a GTA like game where good guys (Enforcers) fight to keep the streets clean from the bad guys (Crims). So choose your side, and go be all you can't be!
4981	1	a	Why do I keep coming back to this game? I honestly can call this my first MMO RPG
4983	1	a	It is like GTA but online. I don't pay for money or do missions I just drive around like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Not bad for relieving stress.
4985	1	a	Cool game if you are playing with friends, but it has a lot of downfalls. Graphics, AI problems, Fps drops and hackers...
4987	1	a	Sexy game.
4989	1	a	ITs good .but beware of the lag friends .....!! LAG!! isay LAG!! It can be devastating ... WELL YOU CAN GET USED TO THAT I FEEL CALM WHEN I GET USED TO IT      LAG!!!! I SAY LAG!!
4991	1	a	its the greatest game ever :)
4993	1	a	I thank that APB Reloaded is a good game for online gameplay. If you like Blowing up your friends cars, Killing peoples drug mules, and more of this trolly contint that you will LOVE this game! From making cars to giving you millions of guns, Most everything is 'Man Made.' (You can make it your way) Its always cool when you speed by a nub with a pink drug van!
4995	1	a	Certainly at its best when playing with a group of friends. Sure the game might try to reason with you to spend money on the game (Decals limits, exclusive items, powerful weapons, increased EXP rate) and have bad community where in my case, people swearing left and right and accusing of hacks. It has bugs but if you're with someone you call as a friend it's easy to let those errors slip aside. If you have someone playing the game, give it a try. If not, well you can try and make friends over there.
4997	1	a	This Game Has Customization, Cars, Freindly People, RPers, And Most Of All, GUNS. GunsGunsGuns!!      WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?!
4999	1	a	If your waiting for GTA V to come out for the PC like me, this is a fun game to pass time in (assuming you don't want to play GTA IV, of course...)
5001	1	a	Very fun to play with friends. Alone it's not as fun but still it is. Being a nice change to other Free 2 play MMOs.
5003	1	a	DUDE YOU GOT TO FIX THIS I CANT EVEN PLAY
5005	1	a	Cops and Robbers, GTA style. What's not to love?   In-game midi sampler to create your own 'theme' In-game MP3 import system for car radio F2P Customisations only limited by number, not customisation.   Only thing is 250ms+ latency makes some missions unplayable, especially against those near the US Datacentres.
5007	1	a	get apb because u can mug black people
5009	1	a	this is one of the funnest copen and crim games i have ever played 
5011	1	a	Although it has some faults overall I think its agreat game with alot of potential.The customization is absolutely awesome,and so is the expeience you'll have playing.Sometimes it can get laggy but not often,oh and the match making system is questionable at times. If you like GTA then this is deff for you.
5013	1	a	Pretty Legit
5015	1	a	Great Customizations!
5017	1	a	it is awesome i mean you can be a cop or a bad guy you would never stop playing it because it has guns on each freaking side lke hloy hell. thank you for reading my review :D
5019	1	a	This is the most vile pile crap ever made for pc. Its a virtual sewer if there ever was one. The people in this game are very helpful. And by helpful i mean they will help you  Die and Lose missions by blocking your car or placeing their own vehicle over the drop zone. And great freinds who will kill you as soon as look at you. And of coarse everyone has something nice to say. Usually lots of kind words that happen to have only 4 letters. Any way ... if your head is not in a toilet somewhere go ahead and get this game. its awsome.
5021	1	a	Hell yeah, awesome game!
5023	1	a	Really good F2P game that takes a unique turn on Third Person Shooters and MMOs. The customization is truly amazing. Customize your body appearance, clothing, car, music theme that people hear when you kill them, make your own songs, etc. Main complaints are that theres not enough content to drive the game and the matching system is flawed. You can either do PVP in arenas where a team of Enforcers goes against a team of Criminals, or do missions in one of two mission district instances, which leads to grinding, as the tasks are repetetive. Upon doing these missions, you run the chance of getting matched up against people who greatly outclass you, better perks, weapons, etc. Think of it like four level 20s trying to take on one, two or three level 60s in WoW, along with three, two, or one level 20. GREAT social and competetive game once you level up in that you can customize everything, show it off, and PVP, but leveling up proves to be more frustrating at times rather than fun.
5025	1	a	this is a must get game with lots of fun action 24/7
5027	1	a	dont waste as much time as i did on this pile of garbage
5029	1	a	Its pretty fun, be wary of it being a bit pay2win.
5031	1	a	There aren't enough isocubes for the population.  Mute the game though, or you will feel the need to hand out more agressive justice (and choice of verbage).
5033	1	a	This is a yes if you like mugging people as a criminal D: and a no of you dont want to lose your prestige for 'accidentaly' running over a civilian
5035	1	a	this game is off the roof when it comes to multiplayer, i would honestly recommend this to anyone who wants constant MMORPG, TPS*, and lots of fun!!! it's like GTA, but 1000000% MORE AWESOME!!
5037	1	a	If your looking for a free alternative from the expensive GTA V you have it right here, Astonishing Game just earn your way through to become a flawless Criminal or enforcer, it's your decision! :D Honestly your eyes will be glued to the screen for hours, I haven't wasted one minute playing this game :D  Thanks, I Be Crazeh! 20/04/2014
5039	1	a	Black person sim
5041	1	a	Best game i've seen that lets you choose whether to be a criminal or a enforcer. Its not pay to win, i myself use the starter gun and i get my share of kills. 8/10
5043	1	a	Such an addicting game! Customization is phenominal, the ammount you can do is ridiculous. It does have a little bit of a learning curve, once you get it the satisfaction is very rewarding! Especially with the new engine underway this game is going to get better!  
5045	1	a	Alright, I'll say it right off, if you want something to just pick up and play and be great at it, this is not for you. It takes practice. Skill can overcome almost anything in this game (Except the serious problem with hackers) If you invest money in it, it can be fantastic, though I have not yet spent a dime on it. Going into this game remember to keep a cool head and communicate with your team, also remember it is a GAME meaning it is here to have fun. So have fun. I personally consider it a canvas. The customization in this game is addictive and delicious. It takes a serious grind to get everything, and I doubt I'll ever make it, but being able to customize to this degree, I think it's well worth while. Plus, who doesn't like killing cops while blasting Hollywood Undead out of your car speakers? Or blasting Five Finger Death Punch's 'Mama's said knock you out' while mopping the floors with some criminals? Either way, the customization is there, and if you like games but never feel like you play as yourself, or the character you want to be, or maybe you're just settling or picking a favorite, in any case, if you want to express yourself, this is for you. If you're reading this recently after I posted you can see my steam profile pic is indeed a modified screenshot from the game. Start it up, guys, be patient and try your best.
5047	1	a	APB reloaded is fun shooter if you want to shoot people or just went to kill cars and if you are a law and order kind of guy then ok this is the game for you.
5049	1	a	i would luv this game if i didnt lag so much -_- lol
5051	1	a	A great game with alot of good weps and armor, Alot of players enjoy playing this BUT there are too much wall glitchers which stay there and kill people as a bounty. This game is A bit of PTW (Pay To Win) Needs to add Good snipers with Ingame money.  But as always, i love this game, it is so much fun, enjoy.
5053	1	a	Not bad, but it still needs some improvment.The cars handling is not that good, it's like they are on ice.And then when you begin then all the 'pros' kill you beacuse they have better weapons than the beginners.   I would give it a 5/10
5055	1	a	nice game but driving sucks big time!
5057	1	a	it's really fun when you have a friend to play with
5059	1	a	awsome ame i know i spelled awesome rong but still oooowee whats with that whats up with that 
5061	1	a	Great game just like gta and its free what more do you want
5063	1	a	I recommend this game because of its free roam worlds and the way you can do things in this game, its just amazing. The only thing that i dont like about this game is that the launcher keeps redownloading everything for the game for me. pretty much what im saying is, fix the launcher or dont have a custom launcher at all. why dont you just launch it from steam? Well other than that the game is absolutley fun!
5065	1	a	It's not pay to win. I promise.
5067	1	a	ermergerd love this game. only good with a relatively good internet tho.
5069	1	a	Wanna be a Criminal? Sure why not? Wanna be an Enforcer? Sure why not!?!?!? Shoot bad guys do missions rob people steal cars.... basically this is a GTA MMO. GET THIS NOW!
5071	1	a	This game. Hell yeah. You can be the biggest pimp there ever was. Sell stolen computers, mug scurbs on the streets, put on that backwards hat, add a spoiler to that gay car you bought, you can do anything in this game, well, that a pimp would do.
5073	1	a	cooooool nice games of open world games
5075	1	a	This game has a good idea about it but they need to sort out the level difference in lobbys 
5077	1	a	very nice game! Its free!! download!
5079	1	a	I got this game, and made an account to play it, but when i got on to try and play the game, it said that i was not old enough to play. seeing as i am 21, i am really confused as to why the game thinks i am not old enough. is there a way to fix this?
5081	1	a	fun as heck 
5083	1	a	LOTS of fun if u find out how it all works and find a good team of ppl willing to play with u
5085	1	a	im kind of in the middle on this one it isnt the best and it takes alot of downloading and a good computer the driving mechanics are bad and i mean BAD but if youre in to like gmod role playing you might like this it has alot of features and great potential this is the diference with pc and console pc can change big time and i hope it does but on console you cant do that much its free so i guess i would play it every now and then i really hope the developers start fixing all of the bugs and definatly fix the driving
5087	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate the game 95/100 percs
5089	1	a	PVP only crime sandbox MMO. Its super imbalanced and Pay2Win but I'll be damned if it isn't fun. The best character customization in any MMO ever.
5091	1	a	It's a bit frustrating at times, but over all alot of fun, and with a nice set of customizable options too! :D
5093	1	a	This game is basicaly Gta mixed with Saints Row
5095	1	a	Saints row MMO. 
5097	1	a	This game sucks
5099	1	a	APB Reloaded is a fast paced, shoot em up, Free to play, open world strategy combat MMO; and if you are any good at it, you hate it with a passion.   I recommend it.
5101	1	a	Very nice game!It is so fun if u have some friends!It's not pay2win because Star556( free gun u get it at start) it's op if you know how to use it! 
5103	1	a	fun as all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! this game is what gta should have been!
5105	1	a	If like GTA, honour first creator, play APB. Plutarks be pleased.
5107	1	a	This game has an awesome grindy mmo feel with a GTA-like theme. The only problem is that it's very pay to win but you can EASILY avoid it by going into servers for lower ranks so you dont run into high level pay to plays.
5109	1	a	come try this game out with me! my name in game= Mimistacy (enforcer) its not that populair but a bunch of ppl still play it! super fun game and rek ppl on and also costume ur own cool car/costumes (see my screenshots of APB)  HAVE FUN xxx
5111	1	a	All Points Bulletin, or APB for short.....what to say? It's a 50/50 with me,   This is a great free-roam game, and the ability to make your own character is good. all the different vehicles you have to choose from are great, and the fine details on everything is nice to see.  However, there are problems (still decent for a free game). First thing being that you don't own any of the guns unless you go to Armas (and pay their BS prices), which could very well ruin your experience in the game; seeing as they don't know how weapon-fairness works. If you don't have a premium account, then you're limited in EVERYTHING (so don't go thinking big with those decals and clothing designs). While you're driving you might also experience this funny lag where your commands are a little late and you end up smashing into something.  Don't get me wrong, I like this game alot. Just don't go in with high expectations or you will be disappointed
5113	1	a	its so funnn
5115	1	a	This is a fun multiplayer third person shooter, it has a lot of customizaiton and is very addictive. If you enjoy GTA or games similar to that this is a must have, and best of all its free.
5117	1	a	Very fun to play with friends or without friends. Either way, it's solid. Being a good change to other MMOs. The game looks amazing and even with minium settings. 8/10 stars.
5119	1	a	The Cops vs Robbers you dreamed of, but with less freedom and more trolls. The dress up is awesome, the combat isn't terrible, and it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing free. You want it and there is no reason not to get it.
5121	1	a	pay2win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t that I will likely play again with my friends because I remember that my avatar in game is really tall, has a great tan, striped panties, and DEM HIPS. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5123	1	a	the best game but kicking me all time plz fix it
5125	1	a	Its rediculously fun
5127	1	a	This game is one of the best mmo games in my opinion. It's a third person shooter in the great city of San Paro. This game includes so much customization. You can tune your car, buy some clothes and make music and share it all. You can choose between an enforcer and a criminal with both their own gameplay elements. You can choose various guns out of a huge arsenal of weapons. This game is also free, so don't doubt to download this beauty and try it out yourself.
5129	1	a	Fun game to play with friends
5131	1	a	Most of the time it wont work
5133	1	a	this is a great game!!!!
5135	1	a	10/10-APB Reloaded it is a very fun and unique game you pick a side the cops or the criminals both with different gameplay the criminals can rob store windows and load the stolen items into a truck and the police can chase them or the criminals can go and sell them for dirty money. I do reccomend you play this as it is is free but the only down side is that there are many hackers and it is kind of p2w at some points with super fast tommy guns or super fast cars that are bought with a ton of real cash.
5137	1	a	awesome fun.Lots of players andd missions.customizing is amazing
5139	1	a	Always better with a team.
5141	1	a	If im being completely honest here, it's one of the most exciting games ive ever played. Yes At low levels and if you dont purchase items for the sellers it's quite hard to win missions but even the basic details like driving and looting bring a smile to my face
5143	1	a	it is fun play now it isn the funist one yet
5145	1	a	this game is awesone
5147	1	a	Great game if you can put up with the lag and occasional bull poop moment... has improved slightly over the years but they wont fix the servers for some reason...
5149	1	a	+ It's a nice game with decent graphics, and multiplayer. + Alot of nice vehicles, some new would be nice though. + The customization is out of this world, i have never seen a better one + Driving is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. + The game contains some nice tunes in it, that you can access anytime with P. + It's free for play, and not pay to play. + Premium is a nice touch, only that it's pricy, would love some more free premium days! - The matchmaking system is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you end up with gold threat even though you are silver, and if you are gold you end up with noobs. - You usually end up with stupid teammates, and ofcourse they have the worst gun and can't aim. - Griefers with trucks, they ram, slam and kabam you into buildings making you explode &gt;:(. - People speaking other languages in chat even though it's EN server. - Waterfront seems a bit grey, try adding more colour to it. - The 'Whisper' is to OVERPOWERED and should be taken off the game.  i give it a 6/10 :)
5151	1	a	Hack vs Hack free2play
5153	1	a	Great game. If you like Grand Theft Auto, you'll love this. Very great character customization, car customization, and it's just an all-around fun game.
5155	1	a	it is a good game if you are not old enough to play gta giving nearly the same gameplay 
5157	1	a	Awesome Game Great Free To Play
5159	1	a	'This is the best game'
5161	1	a	Damm good game 51 hours of play 2 characters. This game is pure epicness definatly get it
5163	1	a	This game is amazing in every way. I recommend it because it is one of the best shooters out there, lets you customize anything you really want to: Cars, Character, Clothes Etc. If you're into the CoD series, you just might like this game although its not really like CoD, it's fast paced battles with Enforcers, (Cops) Versus Criminals. This game is not, however P2W(PaytoWin), but if you do play it P2W you might have an advantage over other players. This game has been INFESTED with hackers lately, I would not reccomend it Atm(At the moment).  I currently have an R229 Criminal on Colby(NA WEST) The name is SeemsLegitBro
5165	1	a	Great game. But at times it feels like pay to play as there are some OP players out there with payed equipment though with good enough skill you can win. And the game support is actually quite good.
5167	1	a	VERY FUN GAME and now with steam the player base has increased by 3 million get this game its is very beastly
5169	1	a	-=NOTE=- I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME, I'M JUST SENDING A MESSAGE ABOUT ONE PROBLEM  This is an AWESOME game, but there are SO MANY HACKERS!
5171	1	a	Pretty fun game, especially now for being free. Lots of customizing your character, even if you don't have premium membership. Lots and lots of mission variety, from kill the vip, to defend and take and hold. Plus even as a cop you can highjack people's cars. Decent variety of weapons, and the mission districts are pretty big. Overal a pretty fun game
5173	1	a	cool 
5175	1	a	Mediocre, through and through. An good try but F2P limits its potential.
5177	1	a	Great game, alot of customizing, alot of options, over-all entertaining and nice gameplay.
5179	1	a	I And We Dance All Night To The Best Game Ever  OH DIDNT SEE YOU THERE THIS IS THE BEST GAME  IF YOU HAVE COOL COMPUTER XD
5181	1	a	this game not playing in my pc
5183	1	a	Good game,but need a strong computer :) I hasn't it.. :( but I working for it :))
5185	1	a	APB reloaded is an action packed game. It is full of suprises and is so random it's kind of funny.
5187	1	a	Fun with friends, occasional hackers, getmad noobs, pay2win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.... 10/10 best game.       Oh yeah, by the way.... This game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. I love it though.
5189	1	a	This game has excellent customization, not even AAA titles come close to the amount of customization this game has. Too bad the core game is not as good (a bit pay to win too). Had fun with this though, you really should try this game.
5191	1	a	So much P2W, not much fun.
5193	1	a	It's a bit laggy but its fun. 
5195	1	a	If gta and Saints row had a free to play baby
5197	1	a	This game is amazing, especially for a free to play game! I love knowing APB Reloaded is here waiting for me to return home from a long day of work. Whenever I turn on the game it whispers my name telling me to never leave again or it'll delete itself off of my pc :'(
5199	1	a	This game so good
5201	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played! Highly recommended for everyone! It's level of customization is too good to be true. It's amazing! I can't get enough of it!
5203	1	a	10/10 This game is the best when played with friends 
5205	1	a	GTA Online, free to play, nuff sed
5207	1	a	Great idea, not great game. Loads of cool thing behind pay walls, some items are pay to win, severs can be lagy and a fair few hackers. Got a mate or two the game can be real fun, other wise it's pretty bad.
5209	1	a	Game is super cool.T.H.E.B.E.S.T Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool GAME xD             
5211	1	a	As a grizzled APB veteran with a staggering 2.4 hours on record, I can safely say that this game sucks alpaca gooch.
5213	1	a	Award Winning Rage Simulator - 2011 - 2012 - 2013 - 2014  The classic Cops versus Robbers. Create your own music, create your own logos and design your own clothes and cars. Customization keeps this game alive and a wide selection of arsenal from stun guns to rocket launchers keeps it interesting. The community ranges from the underage to your average manchild. Lots of passion and lots of hate.
5215	1	a	Great Game with the best Customization I've ever seen . But you also need a lot of money to get everything you want. And its also kinda pay2win .... Theres many more which could be improved .
5217	1	a	is there a new update becase i full clean my pc
5219	1	a	how do i staert it 
5221	1	a	Love it!
5223	1	a	Very awesome, 1st place in my games list
5225	1	a	a little laggy for me but great game this is like GTA F2P
5227	1	a	very good concept but lags all the time!
5229	1	a	A Nice Open world GTA Style game. Just get it play and enjoy!
5231	1	a	VERY good customization, anything from clothes to cars to your own EYES can be customized almost infinitely! Gameplay is solid, has very good shooting mechanics and the misson system is just to die for, however the car driving seems to lag for me, (probably my crappy internet), but it is still a very engrossing game, i played 8 hours last night, all in all 9/10, i reduced the score by one since latency issues are a bit to severe even for people with good internet.
5233	1	a	IDK I NEVER GOT INTO IT THATS PROBABLY A SIGN!!!! DUDUNDDDNUDNUDNDUNd
5235	1	a	Its Gta Online 
5237	1	a	i liked it just you have to buy weps with real money if you wanna keep them
5239	1	a	WE HACK!
5241	1	a	get apb because u can mug black people
5243	1	a	its amazing  
5245	1	a	While the character creator, theme song composer and the car/tattoo/clothing/logo customisation is top-notch, the lack of a true PvE venue of advancement might be a turnoff for some fans of traditional well rounded MMO experiences. If you love MMOs mainly for the PvP and competitive aspect however, then this is a really solid modern setting title that has decent replay value.  I reccomend you grab a friend before heading out on the town, it is easy to get overwhelmed quickly without some backup!
5247	1	a	I recommend anyone who likes online games and a relatively large arsenal of weapons...
5249	1	a	Always been one of my favorite f2p games.
5251	1	a	good game with friends
5253	1	a	Having logged nearly one-thousand hours into APB:Reloaded, during the many updates, I can confidently say: This game has me forever. APB:Reloaded caters quite well (Thanks to the more recent updates) to new players, but still has a fair learning curve, and rewards the more hardcore gamers like myself.  APB:Reloaded hosts two Factions: Enforcers and Criminals. Whichever faction you choose, you're signing yourself up for the most brutal Cops vs Robbers shooter you've ever played.  Just like with any shooter, no matter how meshed it is with Online play, the tedious dying and respawning will sink its teeth into any gamer and steer them to the point of aggravation. Team up with friends or acquaintances, however, and you'll be the one enjoying the sweet taste of Raging Gamers.  APB:Reloaded incorporates teamwork as well as common sense and intense strategy. Playing against opposition, you need to spend your time wisely; rushing straight for an objective is the best way to feed the opposition kills and points. That being said, retreating to cover behind a vehicle after snagging a briefcase, you had better pray said vehicle doesn't explode if it takes too much damage.  All this reviewing, and I haven't gone over the character, vehicle and weapon customization yet. Needless to say, the vast majority of options given to you, the player, is quite overwhelming and will keep you playing for hours.  All aspects considered, I'm giving APB:Reloaded 8/10. There is room for some improvement, but that will not stop me from playing.
5255	1	a	Weird combat. still a good game fun to crush and be crushed.
5257	1	a	Not bad for a free game however as soon as you start the game you instantly feel the pressure of microtransactions.
5259	1	a	Easily a great game with amazing customization aspects and gameplay, but unfortunately falls short due to a mediocre matchmaking system. If you're persistent enough to push through the bad parts of the game and play with friends, there is a huge potential for lots of fun to have.
5261	1	a	Really needs controller support.. But for a F2P game, it's ruddy impressive!  I'm normally pretty harsh when assessing F2Ps but with this, I'm officially hooked :D
5263	1	a	FUN need fast internet to be able to play 
5265	1	a	GTA Online with 100 people per server? Oh God Yes!
5267	1	a	APB: Reloaded was probally one of the best F2P games I have played, but like with every other game hackers found a way in for a long time now. Theres been a lot more recently too, but APB has given me one of the best expriences in gaming in a long time. People claim that this game is Pay To Win, when if you pay you just pay to get the item faster nothing more nothing less. APB is an amazingly fun game, if you get a match without hackers that is. Although there is an abnormal amount of bugs in it that NEED to be fixed. But, overall APB is really fun and I reccomend it.
5269	1	a	APB is a great game, The gameplay is alot of fun. And I love the way you can design clothes, cars and symbols!
5271	1	a	Deffinately recommended since it became free to play. Its fun and entertaining. If you dont pick it up full time it will atleast make you giggle for a weekend if not a week.
5273	1	a	look stupid and shoot guns
5275	1	a	One of my all-time favorite games on Steam. This game has insane customization and lots of replay value.
5277	1	a	After 1h of gameplay this game ill make u bored =d But atleast its for free!
5279	1	a	really cool game  
5281	1	a	Its only good to hack in, dont waste your G1C because they will ban you for no reason anyways. infact dont waste your time and internet downloading this peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5283	1	a	Talking to friend both get in car hit the front of a van neither of us move Car and Van fly in the air Van explodes both die  10/10 Would question again 
5285	1	a	A good MMO to pass the time with....
5287	1	a	Very Addicting funny game. Nice for playing with friends. I recomend it to everyone (of coure above 18). 
5289	1	a	My game is broken but i have played it before and its realy good. 
5291	1	a	Nice game,good idea - 'Cops vs. Thugs' ,I like that you can create character how you want.
5293	1	a	This is a awsome game if u like being a cop or a robber because this games has what u need
5295	1	a	It's from one of the designers of Grand Theft Auto. So think of it like that. But better, because this is not a serious game in any way. It's all about fun, and it is. I love the customization-- crazy stuff!
5297	1	a	This game is very fun! You can do many things and it has that one thing GTA 5 dosen't have a Cops and Robbers mode and this game is entirely based on Cops and Robbers. Each has there own Vehicles and Weapons very fun and i really recommend this game mostly for Roleplayers or Cop Lovers!
5299	1	a	Good game lots of hacker
5301	1	a	its a awesome game
5303	1	a	Nice to play !!
5305	1	a	Thisis Osam
5307	1	a	i get to draw â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and other insulting icons on my car to strike extra fear into the enemies
5309	1	a	Rather a lot of fun!
5311	1	a	sehr cool 
5313	1	a	It's the multiplayer version of cops and robbers you've always wanted. It almost feels like it's pay to win, but it totally isn't.
5315	1	a	Really addictive high octane 3rd person shooter reloaded with adrenaline shots on every single mission. Huge cities, nice environment, pimped cars, cool music, extreme customization options, tactical missions, good people, good fights. Almost ruined my life!* 10/10 &lt;3         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  APB Reloaded Live Action Trailer HD&nbsp;
5317	1	a	Best Free to Play game out there, the graphics and ability to customize your character make it fun. Not necessary to use real money to advance in the game, i maxed out my character without it.
5319	1	a	One of best Free-To-Play MMO out there! Definitly give it a try. Won't be a waste of your time!
5321	1	a	Best F2P shooter, despite the ongoing server issues and the 'youthful spirited' community.
5323	1	a	There are a few thing I have to say about this game. It grabbed my attention because it was a cops vs. robbers type game that would keep me entertained for hours. First the cons, very repetitive, stupid A.I., cars are difficult to drive, and hard to play at first (minimal problem). Now the pros, great customization, fair for starters, teamwork is required trying to lone wolf it will get you killed, good music, own kill theme, and NPC's run away when there is gunfire.  There are some other things I want to talk about before I finish, all of the players look the same unless you look at the arrows on their head, as said before, you have to work as a team mainly because this is a team game so you have to stick with the team you have because without them you could be going 5 to 1, and the game will be extremely repetitive so you will get bored within 10 days of downloading it (maybe less) only two types of missions.  This game is a fun experience when you begin playing it and gets boring within a short amount of time, but the amount of fun you can have can be worth it if you really want to invest the time.  7/10
5325	1	a	i cant log in to my steam account
5327	1	a	Great game 
5329	1	a	very good game but only enjoyable if you play with a group of friends
5331	1	a	OMG GET THIS GAME BE CRIMINAL AND DO STUFF! ITS SOOOOOO AWESOME
5333	1	a	this game is really fun to play plus its free!
5335	1	a	This game is pretty cool for a realistic shooter.. doing crime is fun I haven't tried the Police yet.. its a bit too hard to shoot other players and I rarly played it enough for all the space it took on my pc so i uninstalled.. it was Enjoyable tho
5337	1	a	APB (All Points Bulletin), the first online game developed by David Jones, the creator of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is a massively multiplayer online game based in living, breathing cities that will feel familiar to players, as they precisely replicate famous cities all over the world. APB is a turf war involving two main factions, the Squads, whose goal is to uphold the law, and the Gangs, who seek to break the law at all costs. Players will be able to choose their side, in a classic good guy versus bad guy scenario.
5339	1	a	I wish it was a Mac Os game also.
5341	1	a	It's like GTA Online, but free. Customization is unreal, so much you can do to make your character.
5343	1	a	Fun game to many pocket warriors
5345	1	a	the best
5347	1	a	APB:R - What can i say? 1: It's the best game i've ever played. 2: It's the worst game i've ever played.  The good:  - First its a fun F2P game.  - Once you get use to the driving in the game cars can be really fun and you and your friends can setup waypoints around the map and race. - The game stops most hacks. Though the game still can't seem to stop some aimbots and macro's. Many cheats in other games on offer are simply not on offer because the servers are hosted by GamersFirst. This means no annoying speed hacks/GodMode/Etc. - No other game can offer you this much customization. You can make your charatcer look like anything you can think of. From 'Ronald Macdonald' to the 'Joker (Batman)' Any of this is possible. You can customize your cars and even make some crazy tattos. - The game unlike Call Of Duty. Requires a lot of teamwork. So i strongly advise grouping up with some friends. You can all work together using different guns so you run up to a enemy with a Shotgun whilst your teammate covers you from a far with a sniper.  The bad: - I have simply never played a game what is so demanding. By far it isn't the best looking game but you can play Battlefield 3 or Skyrim on High FPS but You probably won't be able to play APB at 60FPS without it dropping to 40 or less. - The servers. They suck. Thats all i can say. - Like many F2P there is some P2W in it. If you want to invest a little real money in APB it costs a lot just to get a perm gun for your account ($30+). The guns aren't really P2W. Most of them are just reskins of guns you can unlock in game without paying real money. - This game isn't Noob friendly. Many new players join expecting to play another noob. Well guess what its a either a pro whos created a new account or a decent player who has decided to dethreat so they can stomp on the poor noobs. - They constantly bring new things out. What pretty much always cost you real money.  Conclusion: Get the game its free try it out. When you first get it you probably will get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ kicked all the time. Just chill and carry on playing. When you hit around 50hours playtime you'll be a good driver. Have some cool stuff unlocked and will be winning a few mission =)  Rating 7.5/10 
5349	1	a	yes, this game looks really like gta. but its getting boring after a while! but you should get this game  its really cool
5351	1	a	FIX THE SERVERS!!!!!! Im never able to connect.
5353	1	a	This game is fun...
5355	1	a	i have a lot of fun while playing this game it is difficult but amazing 
5357	1	a	It's pretty good. There's no harm in getting it, so if you're curious try it out.  However, be wary of snipers.
5359	1	a	how do i staert it 
5361	1	a	Great fun, some problems but they only small.
5363	1	a	this game is awesome! love the Customization in it, and its just really fun driving around as a cop :D lol!! highly recomend ^_^
5365	1	a	Good free game, but lacking something......
5367	1	a	This game man. I played it in its original form before it shutdown. I still have never played a game that beats this in character customization. The game itself is fun. More enjoyable with friends. It just feels really cool to be driving around with your buddies and having them hanging out the windows with guns blazing.  Now that the game is free, it is totally worth checking out.
5369	1	a	cool game
5371	1	a	awesome game, hard to play, hard to master, so if you want a challenge play this
5373	1	a	I know a lot of people who dismissed this game as a GtA knock off or a crappy fps. But some people don't dive to far enough into the game the see what it really is, the world of Chaos and Law. Now before you jump to conlclusions i was sceptical of the game as well at first, but it's one of those things that have what you would call a wind up period where people have to get used to the game and figure out what they have to do. That being said I tried it for a couple hours at a time at the start of my criminal career, but i soon found myself logging in more time over and over and over, until i felt like i got into the swing of things. At that point I had been playing solo but i had convinced a couple of friends to try the game and after i had showed them the ropes we got addicted to what we thought was the best part ...MULTIPLAYER... Multiplayer is what can make or break a game and for this game i say it made it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who might be a little lacking in the $$$ department or is just looking for a game that they can have fun with some friends.  8/10
5375	1	a	it is fun but deffinitly is not free to play if you want to actually have guns. they start you out with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ weapons annd the most basic stuff. no more than a rifle a pistol and some clothes, while others are driving arounnd in their 30$ irl money cars with 10$ guns with their fancy clothes that also costs money. not a fun game if you want to play it FREE.
5377	1	a	Great game
5379	1	a	for those who are fans of playing TPS-type games, or you're just looking for something new....this game right here? totally worth it.
5381	1	a	apb is a really fun game it provides lots of customization and u can go out on the streets of san paro with friends and start doing missions or just fool around its up 2 u.
5383	1	a	Awesome cops and robbers style gameplay that pits criminals against enforcers. Crims get to ram-raid shops for quick cash and Enforcers get to use 'less than lethal' (LTL) weapons to bring an enemy in alive by arresting them for more points and cash, along with 'witnessing' crimes by pressing ALT on a criminal commiting a crime in order to get a bounts mission on them.  Overall a great game with tons of customization options and a wide variety of weapons.  A solid third person shooter with a solid style.  9/10 [Mersey seal of approval.]
5385	1	a	I like this game alot.
5387	1	a	this game is the best but i wonderd what if i riched the last lvl in the whole game  would it be fun?
5389	1	a	I don't even know where to start with this game.  I will say first that in my experience, if you don't have someone to play it with, this game will be borning as hell.  with a group of atleast one other person it is hands down one of the funnest games ever. as a criminal you can rob stores and what not which isn't very flashy but still fun.  and as an enforcer it is your job to you know....do cop stuff.    the only flaw to this game that i cannot stand, is the WEAPONS i swear not even with the starting gun i can stand still shoot someone in the back with a assault rifle and they never die, however someone else can shoot me across the map with a different assault rifle and 3 bullets kill me  its so F**KING annoying.   def worth playing tho especially if you can get someone to play with you.  also give it a few hours chance, the interface was confusing at first for me atleast but its worth it. play it. do it now. gogoogogogoggogo.   u.s server joker (na east) deputydann add me.
5391	1	a	very real.....good game 
5393	1	a	The gameplay is likeable, with some nice gunplay and driving mechanics. similar to that of GTA. The character and vehicle customization is rather amazing. you will probably get hours of gameplay simply from customizing and using your character, not to mention how addictive the game is. This is an ideal free to play game for people who do not want to spend money, considering how real money is not required at all to play. Almost all items in game can be purchased through ingame cash, with the items that are not buyable with ingame cash are extra things. Overall the game is fantastic.
5395	1	a	The best way i found to describe apb is that the game is a gta san andreas version,but with a huge range of customization to be done and a lot of fun.
5397	1	a	APB Reloaded isn't necissarily something you would want to play extensively. Much of the maps are drab and boring, customization is enough of a hassle to where you have to farm and play to start looking like you want, and alot of the mechanics that this game tries to work with fall short and make the experience lackluster in the long run. While it's not something I would call a favorite, I have moments in the game I remember fondly, so it's good enough to try at least for a bit. I would reccomend that you pay for at least a month to get a taste of the full game and see if you're happy with the result. I'd give APB: Reloaded and unofficial 7.2/10.
5399	1	a	its the best better than tf2
5401	1	a	Nice game
5403	1	a	I recommend this game to all because it has that good gta side and the saints row the third customization to it it is also really fun too your character can be a cop or a criminal you can have your own crew ive seen team joker army and a bunch more stuff so donwload now
5405	1	a	Like Grand Theft Auto, but like Team Fortress at the same time!
5407	1	a	While playing APB when I did, which was at least a year ago, maybe more, I had fun doing so. In my mind, when I was playing APB Reloaded, I thought of the game as gta online (when it didn't exsist) and I had fun playing it. Though I was mainly robbing places from a day-to-day basis in this game and running from cops. I had fun doing so. I never spent actual money in this game, as I don't for most other free-to-play games. This is a Third Person Shooter/MMO. You can either choose to be a Good guy (Cop) or just a regular criminal. I only played as a criminal but I have heard being a cop can also be fun. And of course this game is a lot more fun to play with friends, but you can always make friends in the game too, I did a little of both while playing this. At the end I grew out of APB, it wasn't a bad game, just moved onto other games mainly because I wanted a feel at other stuff. But when I did play I went on at least three times a week, and eventually got the fast car I wanted to get. Though I wish I could've obtained the Tommy gun, I could not mainly because I didn't really want to spend real money in the game. I would suggest this game for people who are into third person games, gta, or mmos. If you're into buying stuff in the game, and designing your character when you start off this could be for you, though (at least when I played this a year or so ago) didn't have the best character creation. You'd go to a seprate server to purchase clothes, cars, and etc. And you couldn't get the really cool stuff unless you use some of your real money. With or without the real money it is still fun, so play how you want to play. This game is worth checking out, but that's my personal opinion. From my experience of playing this, as long as I did, I would rate this a 7/10 It lacks some things, but there's good things in the game too, hope you liked my review!
5409	1	a	i wish i could play it all i get is a black screen and i can see the main menu flashing.......i think
5411	1	a	loce this game
5413	1	a	Its like cookies, sweet and sometimes bitter
5415	1	a	For being a cop or criminal, this is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It is one of the funnest games I've played and I totally reccomend it to you. It can be hilarious in various ways. So get a muscle car and ramp off â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Go have fun.
5417	1	a	If you have a good graphics card, but to catch the realism of the graphics in GTA'll see.  Also, any items that unlock the fun of feeling can make you a basket case.  In addition, the items are free to unlock the fun you can feel that you can customize.  However, as mentioned above, this game is really high, or if you will need a computer with good specifications.
5419	1	a	An amazing game where a conflict cops/criminals is bloodly, there're a lot of action, in big districts, a lot of ingame hours !
5421	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this with The Respectable Gentlemen Crew on Guardian Server. Lots of great times and laughs. 10/10 would play again.
5423	1	a	I accidently left this running for like 2 days, but I played a good hour and made Paul Sr. from American Chopper. 10/10 IGN 
5425	1	a	This game basically ruined my computer, took me 2 days before it started running back to normal I can play this game at a decent graphic setting but this game is laggy, and very P2W.  Edit: Decided to play again and feels like it has improved pretty decently would recommend. Be warned that this game eats up your RAM.
5427	1	a	Really good F2P gta alternative!
5429	1	a	Best tps F2p game IMO
5431	1	a	Great game before it went free to play.
5433	1	a	:)
5435	1	a	Fun at times but it can turn boring quickly
5437	1	a	Awesome game like GTA but the lag is very annoying so I'm not playing APB anymore but it's an awesome game.
5439	1	a	I love this game. I have played it for years. It's all pvp which keeps the game fresh mission to mission. The character, vehicle, and weapon customizations are awesome. My only suggestion is they should have cooler weapons and upgrades as awards for fight club. My biggest complaint is regulating people who use cheat mods...Gamersfirst has gotten better about it but there shouldn't be an ability to have them.
5441	1	a	Greatest cops and robbers/gta style game of all time. Vast customization and utilization of diverse resources. One midgame-ending flaw: company abandoned its own game as far as rebalance and you have to pay to win at mid-game level.  Definitely worth a play but don't expect to love it as much as you want to love it.
5443	1	a	awesome game, if only they made every item just a bit cheaper. but i dont care. EPIC COPS AND ROBBERS LIKE GAME.
5445	1	a	i love poilici chase so i download this game i LIKE IT SURE PLAY IT
5447	1	a	This game is super fun!!! I love the multiplayer and the character costumization. The guns in the game are really unique because theres such a wide variety of them so it will take a long time to use every gun. Also this game is not a pay to wing game so thats a positive. I give this game 5 stars. Such a good game!! :D 
5449	1	a	Very nice game
5451	1	a	GREAT AND LAG SOMETIMES BUT STILL LOVE THE GAME 
5453	1	a	it wont let me play the game this is bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5455	1	a	It's a tough game. Hard to learn te dynamics and when you really hit someone. It's a very cool game... something like GTA but only with players, including the Police!!! :D Everyone who likes GTA will have some real fun with this one!
5457	1	a	From a totally honest standpoint, I had my objections when I downloaded this game, I thought 'Will this be a pay2win?, Will there be uneven player matches, Will there be hard quests and laggy servers?' Well of course. being the APB is a one of a kind MMO, it's bound to have so many negative features, but what game out there doesn't?  APB Reloaded is an action packed third-person POV game that makes you really on strategy, teamwork, and gear, and although there is a pay2win aspect, you don't need to buy gear just to be a great player. The missions do get repetitive, and it seems like the characters all give you similar quests, which is a downside, but the multiplayer integration goes along well, and most matches have several parts facing you off with opposing forces.  The game is glitchy, to be expected, but it isn't terrible. There is not much lag, and the ragdoll physics are a personal favorite of mine. One thing I do have to say that bugs me is if your car is going about 70 mph or 5000 km/h and you eject, the game gives no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s and you get out unphased. Please fix  Overall, it's a quite smooth, relaxing game, that's really good to play with friends. A big tip to getting famouse would be to make and sell whatever products you make. Always take requests and form alliences at the social districts, or in missions. And lastly, just have fun. Don't let what people tell you to persuade you to not pick up this game, it's a good waste of a few gigs. So see for yourself. If you found my review helpful, please thumbs it up and let others see how good this game is.
5459	1	a	for those who are fans of playing TPS-type games, or you're just looking for something new....this game right here? totally worth it.
5461	1	a	Its all about the wisper OCA man.
5463	1	a	I can describe this game in two words ' APB Reloaded ' now play it.
5465	1	a	Funny open world multiplayer game with criminals vs police. Can be hard to learn and master.  Plus: Funny gameplay Good character customization Good car customization GTA feeling  Minus: Pay to win? Can be hard to master Can be frustrating sometimes
5467	1	a	Nice game, i've been playing as a criminal
5469	1	a	Great fun free to play cops vs robbers TPS. Battling out with up to 50vs50, can get very intense!
5471	1	a	The best MMO shooter ive ever played! Honestly the game is mostly about customization! If you like amazing games then play this!
5473	1	a	great game if you don't mind disconnecting every 30 minutes or so on the weekend. do not play this game during summer, or only play around 6-9 AM EST, when all of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 12 year old brats are asleep. during school season, 4-11 AM EST is a decent time block for playing, since they're all passed out by then. the cash shop â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t is just that: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. paying for access to the premium shop, and then paying a subscription for your extra special guns really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks and you should never, ever do it. always best to play with a group of people for missions, since good tactics and communication always beat shiny cash-shop â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. besides being able to have really intricate character customization, i really enjoy getting in my obnoxious van and following people around while playing stupid music. attempting to follow traffic laws is pretty fun, and a difficult challenge.
5475	1	a	This is a fun game if you get over the fact that high level players will pray on the low level players. I don't think that ruins the game though. I give this a 7/10.          YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  APB Reloaded - Reviews by Dr. Ubershadow&nbsp;
5477	1	a	I like this game alot.
5479	1	a	Its free you can steal cars and shoot people!
5481	1	a	The gameplay and customizing in this game is incredible I have played since the beta and I will always love this game
5483	1	a	this game reminds me of saints row 2 the best one 8/10
5485	1	a	Great MMO Grand Theft Auto style game.
5487	1	a	To actually permanently buy an item you have to pay an extreme amount of in-game cash. Besides that it is fun. 3/5
5489	1	a	I writing a game review cause I have to. Game is good if you play it a lot. its hard to get enough coin to get any good gear
5491	1	a	Yes very cool game!play lot of time!
5493	1	a	Dude grab ur friends and play so much fun man.
5495	1	a	This game has addictable gamplay but also it's poorly optimized ( Laggs,fps problems)
5497	1	a	i like this game its awosme but hard to buy cars 
5499	1	a	Good and fun game just one problem, too many overpowered weapons and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, take that out and the game is great.
5501	1	a	Endless playing. Very dynamic. You can never get bored playing, theres lots to do
5503	1	a	The potential of this game is high and that was already noted in the fact that it was picked up by a secondary company and 'reloaded' to make it into at least something worth playing. The main issue with the game i would probably say is funding as it is a free to play game. I would say this isn't normally to much of an issue if they would have re-released it and then balanced it or at least tried to balance it. With that said you will find yourself constantly out matched, out gunned, and battered into submission by the other players. That is until you make it to the tip top and can finally find some way to hold your own. If the enemy players arn't enough to get to you, the chances that your own team's derogatory comments will. If you can handle the backlash from your own team, the constant balance issues, and the lack of dev well everything then enjoy.
5505	1	a	I recommend this with the stipulation that your computer is better than average. This is a performance-intensive game, but it is worth it. The city of San Paro is beautiful, and the customization options you have for your characters and vehicles are remarkable. When a massive traffic jam causes problems, it can make for engaging gameplay - or it can bog down a subpar RAM setup.  It's a freemium game that under-delivered on the promises made by the original APB. While it is not a perfect game by any stretch, the interactions and gunfight scenarios available to you in the given setting are fantastic. This was GTA Online before there was a GTA Online. It's worth trying, at the very least.
5507	1	a	this is a great game,but i think u should have a X64 computer to run it well,because it needs 4GB RAM at least
5509	1	a	Very Fun but the game is mostly Pay-2-Win!
5511	1	a	Summary: In APB Reloaded you take on the role of a Criminal - hell-bent on causing havoc and making money, or an Enforcer - tapped by the city to keep order. The city never sleeps and the fight never ends in this fast paced Massively Multi-player, Action Shooter! 
5513	1	a	Great game. Loads of fun. It's like GTA but online. The amount of customization beats any game I've ever seen. Sadly, gameplay 100% competetive and ate up with cheaters. Aside from that, you will have tons of fun just hanging out with friends and designing your character, cars, clothes, tattoos, graffiti, and even music.
5515	1	a	A game that is worth playing
5517	1	a	GTA online. pretty much. If your pc can handle all the action, its worth the time. Plus free, win win?
5519	1	a	Needs a Mac version of this game ASAP!
5521	1	a	Hundreds of hours, since the very first P2P release. Five stars.
5523	1	a	A very well made Free to play game. Think GTA settings except better everything. there is TONS of customization for gear and cars to make your own personal theme.  Handles lag issues from Australia ok (except for driving but you get kinda used to it). Considering its free to play, it is very much worth checking it. Having tons of fun.
5525	1	a	The BEST free to play game ever! 
5527	1	a	Is laggy tho.
5529	1	a	very fun game minus tryiing to get mney oterwise I reccomend this game
5531	1	a	I never wanted to play this game.. I wasted my life.  10/10
5533	1	a	uuuuh I played dis game, I think it was about the old childhood classic 'Cops and Robbers'
5535	1	a	i have never played this game
5537	1	a	I can't say I played enough to give a proper review. 10/10
5539	1	a	APB Reloaded through steam was ten times fasted on the download/patch and game update. It like playing gta 5 online for free, with much more customization and its just a un experience. I have recomanded this game to many of my friends and i recomand that it should be played through steam.
5541	1	a	A lot of fun, steep steep learning curve as it is mainly focused on non-programmed cover based combat and can lag to an extreme extent.  Pros; -Best customisation I've ever seen in a videogame -A lot of fun once you pass the initial learning curve -Enforcer and Criminal factions are fairly balanced, with Less than Lethal weapons being the only real difference -Ram Raiding/Witnessing crimes and bounties have very fair pay offs -Teamwork really does shine -Premium benefits are well worth the price   Cons; -The learning curve is easily 16 hours of just pure experimentation -The difference between f2p players and Premium players is apparent as the f2p players will be at the disadvantage in both weapons and funds -Expect to pay at least $50 -Terrible AI -Vehicles differ in stickyness and handling -Repetitive missions -Lag will destroy you  Solid 75/100 game. 
5543	1	a	Great Game and Free i think u would enjoy :D!!!
5545	1	a	this is a really good game if you want to play a game like gta 5 but dont have the cash to fork over. 8/10 overall
5547	1	a	This is quite possibly one of the worst games I've ever played- No balance and lackluster story make this game more of a chore than entertainment.
5549	1	a	Three words: Saint's Row MMO....Nuff said.
5551	1	a	this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ flame â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5553	1	a	Great persistant world GTA-like MMO! Absolutely love it! :D
5555	1	a	Awsome game. Awsome when alone and even better when playing with about 2 friends.
5557	1	a	 Easy to learn, a lifetime to master
5559	1	a	This game is a great MMO. Be a crimilnal and rob people or be a vigilante and stop the criminals. Play with me on the server thats closet to your location ;)
5561	1	a	The worst â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing imbalanced crappy piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you could ever play.Stay far away and let it die once and for all.good game for griefers,trolls amd hackers.
5563	1	a	Really good game overall.
5565	1	a	wow much shooter
5567	1	a	I am so addicted to this game. If I could afford to, I would skip work to play this all night tonight and all day tomorrow. Simply amazing!
5569	1	a	It's best Game...download and play it.  It's Funny xD  E na figata scaricalo e provalo
5571	1	a	One of the best 3rd person shooters I've ever played, lots of fun in a massive city!
5573	1	a	even tho their are hackers this game is great fun just to mess around on the phusics are comical i love this game
5575	1	a	Loads of things to do
5577	1	a	Great game just needs to fix the bugs. has a lot of potential tho
5579	1	a	Nothing is more then unique then APB, it has it's flaws, but the game model is quite the experience.
5581	1	a	very underestimated, its really good i like the creativity involed in the game and you should definatly download this. people say this game has hackers and bad performance, i have encountered no hackers and have smooth fps, but what do you expect its a huge game its not going to run 60fps with no problem.  11/10 - ITS FREE!
5583	1	a	APB is a very good game. Belongs to the sand table style game can be where you let all can go. There are many ways to do the task, very interesting
5585	1	a	This game is one of a kind.... But it runs out of fun after you get some good stuff 
5587	1	a	-Pros Good open world with lots of landmarks and combat-friendly areas Fun car controls &amp; car variety Lots of stuff to do Music player in vehicles is pretty cool Amazing customization of characters and cars  -Cons Pay to win Really bad servers (although they're getting better) Unoptimized, lag spikes (even on great hardware) Takes several minutes to launch for some machines 
5589	1	a	i dunno man, this reminds me of Saints Row + Gta
5591	1	a	its a cool game 
5593	1	a	-
5595	1	a	The overpowered paid weapons and occasionally inappropriate match-making cause this game to be unbalanced. Otherwise it's a pretty decent multiplayer shooter and it enables comprehensive avatar making. More fun if playing with friends.
5597	1	a	I play this game when I want the flood of hackers to punish me.
5599	1	a	APB is a very nice game but too bad I mean get stuck in the game I play 2-3 minutes and locks. Pretty please help me. Thanks
5601	1	a	After playing this game for over 120 hours, I've finally realised that it is just a ploy for money. Having said that, I should also bring to light my very many laughs and good times I've had with this game. With the 'missions' and pvp so frustrating, the only redeeming quality of this game is customization. Filled with infinite possibilities, the game is fun, however tiresome and rage inducing. I'll have to give it a 6.5/10
5603	1	a	I enjoy the join friends factor of this game. Being able to group up with friends and go out on a mission of chaos as either a criminal or a law enforcer is completely fun at times. The game itself can be challenging unless you like games where you can kill others and just cause utter mindless destruction. I also like the options of gaining different clothing, guns, vechiles and such for doing missions. And if you are especially creative, you can make emblems and designs for clothing, vehicles and sell them on the marketplace to other players for in game money.
5605	1	a	Simple Cops vs Robbers but highly addicting ! One of the Best F2P Games
5607	1	a	a lot of lag, but a great game~
5609	1	a	Good graphics, big community, frequent updates, A HUGE CUSTOMIZATION, and it's free. What else could you ask for(besides for the cars to have better steering)?
5611	1	a	this game is for sure one of the best games ive played i would recommend it to people who like mmorpg games and people who likes action games and free roming without doing missions it has great quality and the sound is perfect the only problem i have is i wish there were more districts.
5613	1	a	Imagine GTA where you should buy everything for REAL money.
5615	1	a	this game has change a lot but what sucks is low lvls get kill my higer lvl people but other than that the game is pretty good
5617	1	a	its a pay to win game but play if you want to
5619	1	a	Free-To-Play, is about the only reason to pick up this game. The community is small, and it's not as polished as it could have been. That being said, it does have it's fun aspects. Everything is a little confusing/overwhelming at first because you're kind of dropped into the world without much of a tutorial, but it's not difficult to work out. Having a friend who plays or would play with you religiously would make it a decent way to spend some time.   Overall I give it a 6/10, it just seems like a dying game that didn't live up to it's potential.
5621	1	a	nice but not working plz cantact the server 
5623	1	a	Yes, definitely. It's free and it's fun. Cops and robbers, man.
5625	1	a	Wont Start what to do?!
5627	1	a	Very fun, you can creat a lot of stuff for your cars or your own outfits and it's a Shooter, what do i have to say more exciting than that? :D
5629	1	a	This game is decent if you are willing to look past the bugs and rage inducing Pay 2 win weapons. I do suggest that you play with a group of friends and use VoIP, seeing as how its damn near impossible to win any missions without communication. This game is also pretty poorly optimized, loading the freckles of the pedestrians faces before loading the wall that you are about to unwittlingy drive into, so I urge you to only play this if you have a damn good machine and no anger problems.
5631	1	a	Despite APB's insane customisation options it's hampered by a too small a gameworld to play around in and repetitive missions. Hopefully future updates will rectify these issues, but until then this game is just 'OK'.
5633	1	a	APB Reloaded is a very unique game in certain ways. Even though it may have low critic acclaim, it is very similiar to Grand Theft Auto, with fun car and gun play, infinite customization and tonnes of side-quests. This 3rd-person, sandbox, action multiplayer is a must get as it is free and quite simple to download. My Rating: 7.5/10
5635	1	a	the best f2p i ever played,its a gta style based mmo,wich will grant endless hours of fun for the lovers of the style. the costumization is awesome,wich gice u the power to make very cool distinct chars or vehicles,etc... have its flaws,and requires a powerfull pc to play even in lowest settings,but the size of the worlds and the concept manage to keep the game interesting and fun.  i have 4 chars 2 accounts,and more then 2000 hours combined,it says alot about the game. im a gta lover,and this is the ultimate multiplayer for playas like me. at least till something can compete with it.  many will say its a pay to win game,but i have several premium weapons,and none of them is so overpowered like some people try to pass the image. btw if u wanna try premium search for the real retail pack in the web,will give u a premium primary weapon account lifetime,premium side arm,premium car,500g1 and 30 day premium account (wich allows to win money faster,and wider costumization) if u buy the rt1 (retail pack) check utube videos t see wich weapon is best for u. the normal player preference is (scout,csg,whisper,ntec) by the order i putted.  its very hard game to enter,with a long learning curve,but after u manage to pass that part,will become a game that u will return over and over again. a must have,and one of the best f2p in present time in my humble opinion. peace.
5637	1	a	Bears similiarities to Saints Row and GTA, steep learning curve but alot of fun. This game has been going strong for a while now and though progress is slow it is being update constantly, a whole new area has been added as well as multiple items which can be had at not actual cost. This game is the very formula for a proper F2P, there is no pay to win and should you chose to purchase a weapon or vehicle be certain you shop wisely since each is well suited to a particular playstyle.
5639	1	a	Im as gay as this game!
5641	1	a	All Points Bulletin, or APB for short.....what to say? It's a 50/50 with me,   This is a great free-roam game, and the ability to make your own character is good. all the different vehicles you have to choose from are great, and the fine details on everything is nice to see.  However, there are problems (still decent for a free game). First thing being that you don't own any of the guns unless you go to Armas (and pay their BS prices), which could very well ruin your experience in the game; seeing as they don't know how weapon-fairness works. If you don't have a premium account, then you're limited in EVERYTHING (so don't go thinking big with those decals and clothing designs). While you're driving you might also experience this funny lag where your commands are a little late and you end up smashing into something.  Don't get me wrong, I like this game alot. Just don't go in with high expectations or you will be disappointed
5643	1	a	This is a fun multiplayer third person shooter, it has a lot of customizaiton and is very addictive. If you enjoy GTA or games similar to that this is a must have, and best of all its free.
5645	1	a	Very fun to play with friends or without friends. Either way, it's solid. Being a good change to other MMOs. The game looks amazing and even with minium settings. 8/10 stars.
5647	1	a	really fun when working with people.
5649	1	a	Combine GTA with E-style GunZ and you get this game. It isn't a new game on the street either - its just recently been converted into free2play. Granted, the nearest Asia server is at Hong Kong, but its still hell of a fun and a challenge to drive cars with one second delay on steering. Shooting's fine though, but expect certain moments where you get awkward kills/teamkills. Yep friendly fire's on, no trigger happytarding here.  The tutorial of the game is limited to the point of being inexistent as of writing, but within minutes you should pick up the basics. Theres a (uncompleted) wiki on the game anyway, go check it out for more info  http://www.apbrwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page 
5651	1	a	um yeah i think that you should make it a fun game to play and get it to be have fun playing
5653	1	a	Like GTA? Basically just like it but as an MMO. Really fun to troll as well lol
5655	1	a	Awesome game, concept's one i'm a fan of.. but if only they had a server in Australia..
5657	1	a	Great character creation and artwork. Strangely addicting gameplay.
5659	1	a	This game is like gta 4 but online mmo. so you chose Criminal or Enforcer?
5661	1	a	This game took me by suprise it drains your time and is very fun GOOD GAME!!!
5663	1	a	Hilarious
5665	1	a	10/10 This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome. Just like GTA except far more indepth with charactacter and vehical customization. Its massively multiplayer and best of all ... Its free. Only one down side is the Australian server has not been released yet, but I will be patient.
5667	1	a	Cool, Game, Very GTA but with mates.
5669	1	a	Like GTA you can customize character,car and many more.you must try it!!
5671	1	a	APB Reloaded, pretty fun MMO. I enjoyed the time I played it. I recently stopped playing it. Idk why. It got really boring after a while. Pretty much this is a Grand Theft Auto MMO. Which I was excited about! Grinding for money also got boring. The game was really p2w. All the good weapons you had to pay money for. I recommend this game to GTA and sandbox type game fans. Just try it out, you might get bored, you might keep playing it!
5673	1	a	Rating 5~~~ Would love to give this game like a 7-8 but due to Aimbots and hackers this game can give you a hard time. So when play'n you might have to pick this game up and drop it for a bit to cool off if you get mad at games. Yest its a Free to Pay game i.e. youll be just fine with out getting out your wallet but be prepared when you face a subscriber or someone who just felt like sinking some money into the game. Very Cops &amp; Robbers/GTA/MMO style game. I say make sure you try it out but relize you have been warned.
5675	1	a	If your computer is from the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ future then you'll love this game. Luckily, I'm Christopher Lloyd so...yeah.
5677	1	a	Played it for awhile too like planet side 2 but i dont understand such a thing O.O the Vehicle control really hard to learn.. and its fun never tried playing like police or something
5679	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with this game, free to play, and cool
5681	1	a	this was my fist stam games 
5683	1	a	I like to describe this game as basically, 'Multiplayer Grand Theft Auto'. You're in a large scale city environment with traffic, NPCs, and other players and it's third person shooter style. The storyline behind the game makes it somewhat believable: the city has deteriorated and crime is rampant. In a last ditch effort to save the city the mayor deputizes anyone who wants to help enforce laws, thus the creation of the two major factions enforcers and criminals. Characters are grouped (typically groups of 2-4 or up to 8 if you call in backup) to help each other with missions that are assigned by a dispatcher depending on their faction. You can create your own groups with friends or be auto grouped. Firefights run rampant and most are really enjoyable to partake in. But it's the endless amount of customization you can do to your character, music, and vehicles, that makes this game shine. If you can dream it, then you pretty much can create it with all the different ingame editors.
5685	1	a	Love it 
5687	1	a	Fun way to kill some time, just don't take it seriously. The community on this game is awful.
5689	1	a	Alot of fun! Competitive, alot of room to be creative, and is a good challenge to constantly be on your game and get the advantage over your enemies, I love playing this game, it's personally my favorite free to play game on Steam
5691	1	a	Great TPS very nervous !
5693	1	a	game is pretty cool
5695	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
5697	1	a	Love this game. It's a nice twist on cops and robbers. The addition to being able to arrest criminals is awesome IMHO. If you're looking for a good Cops vs Robers kidna game this is it.   The only con I have with this game is that at times it will freeze and force you to restart your computer unless you disable all but one audio device.
5699	1	a	for a free2play, its pretty darn good :)
5701	1	a	worth a try, it has mad customisation and the idea is pretty cool
5703	1	a	Great game if your a fan of GTA series.
5705	1	a	This game is BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING BUT STILL FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
5707	1	a	Pretty good game.
5709	1	a	Everybody Should Play
5711	1	a	Great TPS very nervous !
5713	1	a	Cool game :)
5715	1	a	Very good mmo game.Sometimes the servers are not so good but it is nice.
5717	1	a	After playing this game for over 120 hours, I've finally realised that it is just a ploy for money. Having said that, I should also bring to light my very many laughs and good times I've had with this game. With the 'missions' and pvp so frustrating, the only redeeming quality of this game is customization. Filled with infinite possibilities, the game is fun, however tiresome and rage inducing. I'll have to give it a 6.5/10
5719	1	a	Love the game and the customizations but some hackers r spoiling it
5721	1	a	this game is awesome 
5723	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
5725	1	a	Free? Oh dear, not another bad ga- Wait, this one is actually... Quite enjoyable! Customizable cars, characters, logo's and themes? Woa! With a competitive free-roaming Multiplayer with it? Hundreds of weapons to choose from?! I'm in.
5727	1	a	Strongly recommend this game.  Possibly the highest customization you'll ever see in a free PC game, ranging from character appearance to car appearance to weapon appearance. Strong and intense gun fights, strategic play, teamwork, open-world, you can have fun when you're not even in a mission, collect items, patterns for your customization, parts for your cars, new guns, make your own theme song for when you kill someone, maybe you want to dazzle them with your impressive skills or maybe just completely annoy someone by using an annoying tone such as the mario death theme or the trololol song. The horizons of this game are only known by your creativity and skill. You want to use a car as a ramp and jump out mid-air and blow your enemies up with a rocket launcher? You got it! You want to stun groups of enemies, arrest them and dance around them while they're left defenseless and waiting for the timer to run out so they can respawn? You got it! You want to joyride? Got it! Want to steal items and cars to make money from them? Got it! Are you a enforcer? You can't steal? Who says you can't? Ram a criminal's car into a store and those items are yours to pick up, unless you want the criminal to put them in his car first and then steal his car with the rest of his stolen items, you can turn them in for cash too, just like they can. Want to host a huge group and muck around in the social district? YOU CAN. Want to voice chat to your team and other people nearby? YOU CAN. You want to tag your customized graffiti on a billboard? YOU CAN. You want statues of yourself? HAVE THEM. Whether you want to be good or bad, or a mix of both, there's something in this game for everyone, except for maybe children and pregnant women, well maybe pregnant women are okay, idk, go into labour and let your kid's first words be 'Hey brudda' ~ Wilson LeBoyce.
5729	1	a	This game is like a Free GTA, plus more
5731	1	a	APB: Reloaded.... Where to start, a fast action pace 3rd person shooter (Left or Right arm angle) Drive Cars, Shoot People, Collect Cash, Upgrade ur weapon/car &amp; Customize EVERYTHING! Its great game but very rage based in the fact that competition is so high.
5733	1	a	I loved this game, but i have a problem with it. Everytime i play APB Reloaded after around 2 or 10 minutes it Disconnected, I couldn't find the solution, What am i going to do? P/S : Sorry for Broken English
5735	1	a	good game with vehicles,thiefs,cops,and arsenal but some weapons are with real money so if u realy wana be good game is pay to win
5737	1	a	Honestly the ONLY reason i gave this 'Do you recommmend this game?' a *Yes* is because it is good for someone who doesn't own Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row, *!WARNING!* If you own ANY Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row game's this is a 1 out of 5 compared to those game's which have a 4 out of 5. also all that is different between the good cop like people and the bad thief's are that they have different vehichle's and clothing. as both the cop and the thief you can steal from place's and even rob people really bad design on their part.   Okay now for the good part of this review.  This game is a extremely good game for the first few day's / hour's if you are a person like me you play it for 30 minutes see you can't actually go in any building and can't really be happy with the story, Anyways, this game has some nice vehichle's *saddly if you want something better then the starting one you have to pay real cash for the awesome one's*  This is honestly just a rip off version of GTA and Saint's Row.
5739	1	a	Best thing ever
5741	1	a	this game is amazing and i love it no joke
5743	1	a	awesome game anyone wanna come on it 
5745	1	a	this is a really good game if you want to play a game like gta 5 but dont have the cash to fork over. 8/10 overall
5747	1	a	I like tha game....kinda like GTA but its not at the same time.
5749	1	a	It's kinda like a free GTA. But with teamwork and a MMORPG style.
5751	1	a	Awesome game. It's like GTA Free to Play... Neverending customizable options for your Character/Car/Music. Run through the City, fight for/against the Law, Spread the safety/terror. Shoot, steal or complete the randomly generated missions. Run up your rank/Prestige, buy weapons, cars and upgrade them. Definitely worth a try. Only problem were cheaters.. but that's from the time it wasn't on Steam and like almost 1 year back, I wonder how they solved that problem.
5753	1	a	yes great game 
5755	1	a	it is a cool game  
5757	1	a	i would recommend this game because it makes my penus large
5759	1	a	This is both the game I've had the most fun with but also the game I've been most frustrated with. It's great fun if you're playing in a party of 4, but playing solo or in any less than a group of 4 can be very aggrivating. If you have friends who can play with you, play it - otherwise, you'll just hate it. Also, a large amount of people hack.
5761	1	a	It never seemed to run on my computer but I have always wanted to play it. I am undecided but it would mosst likely be a positive.
5763	1	a	nice game fight
5765	1	a	Saw butts on a sign and uninstalled.
5767	1	a	I've been playing APB reloaded for about 100+hours so far its not that bad i find it quiet fun, if you arent that skilled it could be a complain on match making, im alright with this since i usually get 2k score rating im inbetween gold/silver ranking. To me its not bad at all nothing wrong with it, yes some weapons are OP in Weapon shop which could be considered Pay to win, but i found after i get upgraded stock weapons that usually comes to Tactics and which weapon is equiped but mostly on tactic it self, i killed and won over many Pay to wins.   To me try it out see how it goes dont give up so fast, you must be pretty good at games like a proper 'gamer' good with progression, people who have just started gaming or havent played much of these type of games would find this game abit challenging. How you tell your doing any good is if your getting better scores they do and over 1k score rating and going up most matches, winning.etc barely dieing. those type of things.  Give it a shot, if your good with it its never a problem with match making at all Also adding - stock weapons are pretty good, i still own golds and silvers with it, not really your weapon, tactic/dodge.etc is the aim i do, i even try crouching time to time. Also a tip you should see if they have any perks like Blood clotting and more armor on them selfs, and change your tactic towards that 1 person, usually for the more armored and slow, i usually fire abit and hit them and reload as quick as possible, then full on kill them with the means to kill them.   Also dont go to Hong Kong server as it isnt in 'hong kong' its more in USA side, also it doesnt have many people in it. so i disagree ever going that server. Give it a shot Gamer!
5769	1	a	This game...Too damn good; been playing only a week and cannot seem to stop. The community is mostly good, and the gameplay smooth and well put together. This is one of my only reviews on steam and for good reason, I don't consider myself fair enough to not be overcritical, download this game, its truly free with premium mostly involving looks and vehicles.
5771	1	a	Truly a good game worth trying.  Pros: Customization on almost everything, Clothes, Cars, Your Personal Avatar Cons: It is somewhat pay to win, premium gives advantage over poorer players.
5773	1	a	Really good game overall.
5775	1	a	A really fun game, have played since the original from Real Time Worlds was released. I would recommend to have a great computer with the minimum of 4 GB of RAM to play this. Apart from this, the sandbox environment of cops and criminals makes anybody happy. Just word of advice, don't play this game if you are easy to become angry.
5777	1	a	It's really got a lot of potential and is already fun if you like games like Saints Row or GTA. It has a lot of customization features and in great detail as well. The only thing I don't appreciate is the rental systems for guns, and the over priced real money purcahses. So for a free to play game it's current structure of real money purchases is highly over valued.  7/10
5779	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME! this game is beautiful, you can create your own cars and characters, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT! APB Reloaded is one of those games where 80% of people have spent alot of money buying cars and weapons which are OP, this makes the game hard to play at times because you are put up against people who can kill you with one shot. it would be cool if you could choose to verse people that are your level and have the same guns as you, so you are not getting demolished by the people who pay to win. But if you dont mind getting killed with one shot well this is the game for you! It is fun to just get your car and Drag Race your friends or Random people, and cause Havoc on the streets with you Dump Truck, speeding along the roads blowing up everything in your path. I would rate this game a 8/10 because of its massive selection of cars and weapons, and the amount of fun you can have with it!
5781	1	a	Kinda cool! :D
5783	1	a	Where do I even start with is game. you got guns. you got hip hop. and you got customization like you wouldnt even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing think possible. this game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. you even wanna roll 4 deep with some homies and just shoot up â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? well in this game you can. need I say more?
5785	1	a	This game is incredible! Comparing it with GTA online, it's a peice of poop. Why?  Charactor creation! You wanna have your character musclar, well OK! You wanna customize your hair style! No problemo. There's so much options for your character! Change cloths, customizing cloths,...etc  Vehicle customizing! Put at least 25+ decals for your car! Even a starter car can be majestic if you know how to! You can also DESIGNER your decals and vinyls with the designer!   Awesome weapons! You can mod the weapon too!   Good friend systems!   There's also some bad things: The match making system. Sometimes you are a newcomer and then you have to face P2Ws. There is a small amount of hackers.  You don't get to change and buy cars right in a mission district. You have to go to the social district in order to do that. I know there are some poopy PCs and it takes 10 minutes to go from a district to another.   The vehicles have too big limits. There aren't boats, helis and jets and tanks. I want it to be in there.  We all want to set our own bounties. I don't like how I have to get killz until I get to notoriety 5 (and that's nearly impossible xD). I want to be able to set my own bounties and the amount of money you get out of a bounty is too small. We definitly want to set 20k bounties.  SUMMARY  Pros: Awesome customizing systems Weapon modding Friend system!  Cons Too much P2W. The worst match making system. Limited vehicles Non-setable bounties.  -----&gt; Game score: 7.1 GOOD
5787	1	a	This game....LIKE OhMehGAWD, My absolute favorite game ever. Having both my favorite things..Cars &amp; Gunz 8)
5789	1	a	awesome third person shooter epic
5791	1	a	THIS MIGHT BE ALRIGHT
5793	1	a	This game is like GTA online bt withought the worry that it will be outadated by a new system or a new vertion because it is on the computer you never have to worry about it being replaced by GTA 6 OR 7 because it will never go away and if you get another computer you can just pull it up on it instead of getting a new x-box or ps5
5795	1	a	Customization in this game is pretty varied and cool. Missions start to get repetitive, but the rewards make up for it.
5797	1	a	Awesome, high quality &amp; freedom. Those 3 titles speak for themselves.
5799	1	a	Game similar to GTA but with an MMO twist on it and random cop vs robbers events at all times :D
5801	1	a	APB Reloaded is an Open World, GTA-like, cops vs robbers style MMOTPS. You get to rent cars and weapons for 10 days minimum or buy them permanently from their overpriced store with real money; then you get to customise those cars with parts you earn doing missions or if it's bought from the overpriced store. You can also customise your characters extensively, dye clothes, design patterns, use them on your clothes or even on your character as tattoos or just add them to your vehicle. About the gameplay: it's purely PVP, meaning you will be fighting against other players, you will either have a lot of fun or get pissy for being accused of hacking/name calling, but that's a bit normal for PVP isnt it. All that being said, game still has some bugs and an imbalanced system that sometimes favour one side more than the other, not to mention the 'pay4win' thing, the overpriced and overpowered market weapons and such. Despite everything the game is quite fun and the best in its genre.
5803	1	a	Its a great action filled MMORPG. You can customize nearly everything in your Playermodel and your vehicles, as well as your loadout and weapons. Big fun with some friends. You'll love to run over the enemies with your cars or blow sh*t up, or just simply hunt the opposition down with all the gunpower you can get. Best thing: Its totally free ! Absolutely worth the try !
5805	1	a	Fun game but when it comes to specs this things just loves to hog your computers power. It really needs to be optimized more and always have lag issues. That being said, it is a fun game espically if your a robber.
5807	1	a	great art work, fun sound, well done customization
5809	1	a	OMG THIS IS SO AWSOME 
5811	1	a	Really good game having fun with it so much i recommend to u ;) try it out.
5813	1	a	Why do I keep coming back to this game? I honestly can call this my first MMO RPG
5815	1	a	It is like GTA but online. I don't pay for money or do missions I just drive around like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Not bad for relieving stress.
5817	1	a	Cool game if you are playing with friends, but it has a lot of downfalls. Graphics, AI problems, Fps drops and hackers...
5819	1	a	APB is an awesome Cops and Robbers game pitting player against player in a fight to control the city. The high customization, as well as the firefights and car chases ensure this game will be high on your favorite games list. 8.5/10
5821	1	a	Pretty Decent Game.
5823	1	a	A fun pvp game of cops and criminals. Good f2p fun, with a few bugs that don't really take away from the over all experience
5825	1	a	this game is absolutly awesome
5827	1	a	You should definetly try this one , since its the best Free to play on steam.Its not a gta mmo but its close , diferent and good.
5829	1	a	Amazingly fun F2P MMO shooter. Best customization out of any game I have played.
5831	1	a	game is good i really like it but we need a Australian Server or something as i get a huge lag and makes it hard for me to play.
5833	1	a	APB is an amazing urban fashion digital dressing room with some ok shooting and driving bits tacked on. Quite possibly the best avatar customization tech ever seen in any online game and worth checking out for that alone.
5835	1	a	Smallest Maps in the History of MMO gaming lol, Still, a funky â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, glad it got brought back. Had a good fan base :)  Game has WAY too much customization, which in turn made the game extremely small in comparison to other MMO's.  If the maps were bigger, And didnt take 30 seconds to get from one end of town to the other, I'd consider giving this another go, But Beta was as far as I went :|  Maybe one day :P When I'm bored â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5837	1	a	Tis game iz lik GTA Saints Row Call of Dutes and Random crap fun, Get it :D (p.s. if you are, go to Colby SW Server)
5839	1	a	The worst game EVER in the history, worst gamplay, worst community, worst everything. DonÂ´t download it.
5841	1	a	Though the game suffers from some imbalances due to bad matchmaking and the arma marketplace, it's one of the best (if not best) third person shooter mmos out there. Take the time to get used to the weapons and driving and you'll love it.  7/10
5843	1	a	A great Third-Person Shooter that allows for full character, car, symbol, and theme customization. That's basically the only positive aspect of APBR.  Negative aspects include a multitude of hackers and exploiters which cause for people to rage easily. The game also includes trolls which like to drive dump truck into your vehicles. Open world districts allow people not a part of your current mission to grief you with what's called 'Ghosting'.  The game is full of bannable offenses but the company, GamersFirst, does nothing about it since their ban policy is based on user input. Users need to record and report a user for a person to be banned.  If you have a weak control of emotions then I would suggest not playing this game.
5845	1	a	Go ahead punk, make my d- OH GOD HE'S PAYING TO WIN, HELP!
5847	1	a	APB is what GTA should of been. Best of all, it's completely free.
5849	1	a	Ambitious, that's for sure, with plenty of insane customizability, but overly-high system requirements and unsatisfying gunplay will undoubtedly see this game die. Again.
5851	1	a	I love this game ! You must to try it &lt;3
5853	1	a	Doesnt Support dual screens, so i had to disable a screen to play it, throws you into a game with no information on what you have to do or when or how. all the quests are as followed, go to point Hold the F key. Pick up thing with the F key drive back to start point. get reward. Driving is terrible cars handle like they are on ice every mechanic in the game is clunky and un refined to the point of it being unusable. Quests that use PVP are simply defend point or capture point while killing people that respawn over and over for 10 minutes. when u die ull respawn about a half minute walk away from the action. youll die in 2 hits, they will die in about 2 Clips. no exceptions. camera sways from side to side like your drunk in gta4 with roman. everything about this game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. a person i know just said that you have to get used to it, but id rather not lower my standerds of play. The only people that play this are the sad people that cant justify paying for it before it was f2p
5855	1	a	Not a bad game when your playing with friends and are looking for a laugh. Major Hacking Issues though. Store Hacked Items, Aimbots, etc.
5857	1	a	I played APB in the First State of game and after the Gamecompany has changed... 99% of the gamer Hack like hell and yes its an nice game if your good in designing Clothes and Cars but so its more like an 'ok' game.
5859	1	a	One of the best MMO Third-Person FPSs that are out there! You are separated into criminals and enforcers, a.k.a. the police. It is basically GTA with all the epic car explosions, absolute chaos in the streets around every corner, and co-op mission style based to achieve all objectives before the other team. It is a must try game! :D
5861	1	a	APB Reloaded is free to play, free roam game.  (i have played roughly 8 hours, so this one may be lacking)  To begin, this game is deffinatly a game you should try, it's a fantastic alternatative to the famous 'Saints Row' or GTA that everyone seems to love.   The game has 2 factions that you choose at the begining of the game  Criminal or Enforcer.  These 2 factions fight eachother to either destroy the city or rebuild and defend it.  The free roam aspect is done well, gameplay is smooth and there's always somthing to do. Gunplay is a bit laggy but manageable   Like all F2P games, there is a Pay sectrion where you use real money to get exclusive items, this may potientally abe a game breaker, as alot of the items are pretty overpowered.   There are also a heap of customisation options avalible to make your character look uniqe.    APB is a fun game with stuff to do in it, Deffinatly give it a try. 
5863	1	a	Prepare to die... A LOT! Particularly whilst you're new. Great character / car customisation, combat is so, so and be prepared to come across the odd cheater or two.  Apart from that it's good enough to waste a few hours on.
5865	1	a	If your short on money or just want to have fun, this is the game for you. When you start up the game, you are told that some city somewhere has gone into complete anarchy. The government has passed a bill that allows vigilantiasm to try and bring down the crime rates. You are then told to choose a side 'Criminals' the Anarchists, who can Mug people for money, steal cars and sell them for money or plow there cars into store windows and steal all of the items that fall out and sell them for money. Or you can choose the 'Enforcers' the vigilanties, who can do missions for money. They can still 'Steal' cars but they have a special badge that makes it ok. You then create your character and give him/her a name and you are ready to play. Basically you roam around the city waiting for a mission to pop up. When one does, people from around the city are randomly selected and put onto two teams. (Recomendation cut short because steam caps the character limit) basically its good dl it.
5867	1	a	If your interested in playing a MMO which has a INSANE amount of costumization options, then give this game a shot.  If your not interested in costumeization, then walk away. Very Very slowly
5869	1	a	Fun if you have friends to play with
5871	1	a	This game is a ton of fun. Once you start making some customizations, and realize that you won't win every fight, you begin to grow and have a lot of fun. There are tons of options to chose from without ever paying, but the paid XP boost is very helpful.
5873	1	a	DUDE YOU GOT TO FIX THIS I CANT EVEN PLAY
5875	1	a	this game was fun
5877	1	a	Cops and Robbers, GTA style. What's not to love?   In-game midi sampler to create your own 'theme' In-game MP3 import system for car radio F2P Customisations only limited by number, not customisation.   Only thing is 250ms+ latency makes some missions unplayable, especially against those near the US Datacentres.
5879	1	a	This game is so very addictive i have never written a review for a game befor but this game is awesome its a little PTW but the amount of joy and awesomeness far outweighs that negative impact... huge wepon selection... lots of different single player type missions and group mission (group missions are a bit on the repetitive side but if you got a good group its fun and there is nothing like jumping in a car and trolling the boys in blue with a few homies in your back seat droppin brass....)  If your looking for a fun time killer and wanna shoot some ppl up as a cop or outlaw this is your game i highly recommend this to GTA lovers....
5881	1	a	onlion GTA?
5883	1	a	Fun game, though slowly turned into a pay to win, but still, worth playing if new to the whole, MMO.
5885	1	a	Great game but it was really laggy for me so I didnt have the best experience,but it was still good
5887	1	a	Okay here's the scoop on this one. Its a great game, annoying, unfair and sometimes downright infuriating, but GREAT! The customization alone should attract you, but there are problems. The balance system is sometimes just strait up unfair as hell. It'll pit you by yourself against 3 other players while you alone attempt to capture an objective. The weapon balance is a MAJOR issue as well, most of the weapons they have in this game dont act like they should in real life, sometimes you can unload on a high player character and while your steadily putting shots into him he still has enough power to tun around and kill you with 2 bullets.  All and all this is a great game, just make sure you have a microphone to coordinate attacks and you'll do great!
5889	1	a	This game makes me happy when i kill the crims and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u should play it now   pick a enforcer or crim enforcers make more money on missions crims can make money buy ram raiding and doing missions
5891	1	a	Not the best shooter around, mostly pay to win because of the wepons ect. But still has an amazing customization option and gives you the chance to create your own thug/hero.  6/10.
5893	1	a	gta for free that is less inapropriate and good game that you can play for hours (criminals are more fun to play) 
5895	1	a	This game can be repetitive on long gameplay but you have at least 10-20 hours of pure fun. GTA style, this game combine a good coop/pvp system with free roaming. There is also a lot of costumization about dress, cars and other stuff. FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
5897	1	a	wow, i have not played anything so bad in my life.. soooooo not coool. terrible physics
5899	1	a	IT'S AWSOME you can't deni it.... IT THE SECOND GTA. BUT WITHOUT HELI'S AND STUFF
5901	1	a	Awesome GTA MMO clone
5903	1	a	This is probably the best rage simulator on the planet.  I am a very in control person when it comes to fast paced shooters even when my computer physicly cannot keep up but this game has managed to release my inner anger i never knew i even had. But dispite all the times you will be angered, infuriated, and made really mad this game is actually really fun.  This game has great customization over your character and even over all the vehicles you own. You want chrome plated wheels you can have it. Police lights? no problem (enforcers only btw) and you can even make your own decals to put on your clothes and cars and even as your ingame logo.  The shooter mechanics of it are good in that it allows you to peak around corners, crouch, and even switch which hand your character uses. You can also take (except for enemy owned or someone elses personal spawned one who isn't in your group) every single car in the city a civilian is driving and use it and pretty much destroy every sign, car, etc... in your way.  Pros: Great customization. Open World Shooter. Matches, open world stuff, and close, medium, and long range combat.  Cons: Lots of lag and some issues with performance (for now they may fix it) Toxic community (its really bad with the occasional good person.) And the occasional aimbot that will get banned in the next few minuets but does not change the damage it caused.  10/10 Would rage, logoff, think, and log back in again.
5905	1	a	Cool!
5907	1	a	Good, free to play game! The best customisation ive seen in any game.
5909	1	a	APB Reloaded, not that bad but not that good either.  You play as either a cop or a criminal and you do missions while you are able to get weapons, customize your character and hang out. This game is seen as a pay to win and there are sightings of hackers so watch out with this game. This game is fair if you actually want to pick this up as a free to play and you're new to Steam. Try it out and see what you think, I was about to not recommend this game but I did since I had fair enjoyment while playing this game
5911	1	a	Decent game with a lot of flaws.
5913	1	a	I've been playing APB for serval years, and i've seen that GamersFirst are updateing the game every week/month with cool stuff, i've wasted 15$+ And it was worth it. I recommend you to Play this game and have fun with others, like your friends, or create new Friends. There are 2 sides who are fighting upon: San Paro, Criminals and Enforcers. I'm an criminal, criminal can ram raid and get money faster Enforcers can witness you and Deliver the money if they Can.  You'll learn fast how to play. The map: Fight club, is used to Comaplte challenges and get JT (Joker Tickets) The others maps like: Finanical And Waterfront are used to do Missions and Rank up, and unlock cool stuff, The max rank is R235 I think.  SO I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE WHO LIKES ACTION!
5915	1	a	The game is fun
5917	1	a	If your waiting for GTA V to come out for the PC like me, this is a fun game to pass time in (assuming you don't want to play GTA IV, of course...)
5919	1	a	Its a free game to blow some time on every now and then. A little confusing at first, but slowly becomes more and more endulgin for a creative mind.
5921	1	a	Very fun to play with friends. Alone it's not as fun but still it is. Being a nice change to other Free 2 play MMOs.
5923	1	a	A Good fun game , It's much better with friends, The only thing i can complain about is the fact that you can only buy weapons that run out after 10 days, Or you can pay real money or farm for 1-2 months to earn one, If you go to buy one with money the cheapest for a character is 28 euro. (Perm for that char)
5925	1	a	I wish it was a Mac Os game also.
5927	1	a	It's alright...I get to many flashbacks.
5929	1	a	Looks so real
5931	1	a	This game includes a dynamic custom content editior in which you use too create all your own content; For example you can make a Hello Kitty symbol and place it anywhere on your Character, Vehicle, or Gun.   You have two factions, Enforcer or Criminal, these two factions battle it out in mini-games known as 'Missions'.This is a very team orierented game. I highly recomend getting a group together before jumping in.   Understand that this is an M Rated game and as such there is content inappropriate for children under the age of 18.   This so called 'PAY 2 WIN' doesn't really exist in this game despite what people will try to tell you. Most of the guns are balenced and can kill any purchased gun, given proper weapon skill, e.g. knowing where to move and how to fire.  There seems to be a minor hacking problem amoug users but, nothing too serious, The Company that runs this game(GamersFirst) does a good job at banning the big hackers. The Servers can be quite laggy at times and this is partly due to the old Unreal Tournament III Engine not being able to handle the game in the first place. They've added a lot of modications to the engine in order to do what it does today. As time progresses we should see an upgrade to the engine, so that is soon to come.  Overall this game gets a 8/10 for replayability and overall tactical battle sense.  Download and try it today!
5933	1	a	a great game, lots of costumization, cars, guns, explosions, this game has everything... except jetpacks :(
5935	1	a	Its fun when you have someone to play with.
5937	1	a	Best game ever exept u have to add that u can destroy the windows from cars so put that in the next update
5939	1	a	You could have a better singleplayer experience from Saints Row (for the similar art and customization) or GTA (for the game type). This game is far from being perfect, and G1 is basically the 4th reich. But it gives me my fill till the HD rerelease of GTA V. But back to the point. APB is awesome, fun gameplay, they just upgraded(?) their anti-cheat and cheaters have been getting kicked like an mma fighter. Graphics are acceptable for how cartoony they are, servers could be better. I get a ridicoulous amount of lag sometimes or none at all other times. Also its not Pay-to-Win, which I love any game that is like that.   tl;dr  Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 Customization 10/10 Community 5/10 Servers 5/10   Overall 7.5/10
5941	1	a	It's an intersting game. Criminals vs. Enforcers duking it out. It's not an MMO apart from an MMO type lobby. The game is made of closed off matches. It's more of the third person shooter variety than a MMO.
5943	1	a	loce this game
5945	1	a	I can't say I played enough to give a proper review. 10/10
5947	1	a	Amazing game, defenately worth a try. However, preapare to grind a little for good items.
5949	1	a	I remember watching the YouTube trailers for this game back before it's first release. I'm glad to see it's still around.
5951	1	a	good time waster
5953	1	a	fun game but because of the Tweeny Bopper that play it and the de-threaters it can get on your nerves
5955	1	a	Free game similar to GTA
5957	1	a	THIS IS ALSOME!!!
5959	1	a	Really fun game, although I heard there's a lot of slowdown issues if your PC isn't from the last year or two. Personally, I like the Criminal side better - but Enforcers are fun to play as well. PVP is fun, however there's a few tweaks that could be made. For example, hitting someone in the head with a gun does the same damage as if you'd hit them in the foot, therefore making snipers almost useless - (or overpowered, depending on your stance - missing the head now works better11) that's my main gripe. Other than that, the customization options are awesome, the music is great and it's a fun thing to play with friends :D 8/10.
5961	1	a	Cancer...
5963	1	a	This game still exists?
5965	1	a	Enforcer Anaiyah approves. (thumbs up) get this game. Do it. Do it now. lol right now!
5967	1	a	Cars, Guns, Newby P2W Newbs, All you could ask for in a F2P game.
5969	1	a	This is the best closest thing to gta 5 for pc that there is 
5971	1	a	While the character creator, theme song composer and the car/tattoo/clothing/logo customisation is top-notch, the lack of a true PvE venue of advancement might be a turnoff for some fans of traditional well rounded MMO experiences. If you love MMOs mainly for the PvP and competitive aspect however, then this is a really solid modern setting title that has decent replay value.  I reccomend you grab a friend before heading out on the town, it is easy to get overwhelmed quickly without some backup!
5973	1	a	I enjoyed this game for like two years i love every thing about it. just the only thing that sucks is that its pay to win most of the time.
5975	1	a	While hackers run rampant in this F2P and there is occasional lag, as a shooter game it's one of my favorites. GTA type gameplay, full customizable options, can be easily played solo or with a group.
5977	1	a	I love this game,except that the noobs don't really get a chance.It needs to be less of a p2w
5979	1	a	The game is extremely difficult to get good at. Hackers are easy to spot. Just dont take it too seriously.
5981	1	a	This Game is like GTA You get to Rob stuff Kill people Mug people and other stuff. You can do hold up's and allmost kill everbody. This game contanes Groups Or also known as Factions. If you like GTA get this game.
5983	1	a	Awseme... Gud Grophix!!! Adn amezang gayme
5985	1	a	
5987	1	a	Its An Awesome Game , A Mix Of GTA And Some Other Random Game
5989	1	a	its like a ex wife thats really hot, you play it for one part that turns into a addiction and hate all the other parts.
5991	1	a	its a good game and dont argue thats a p2w game because if you do it right you preaty mutch have the same gumes 
5993	1	a	Very fun game so many gamemodes so you never really get bored :D
5995	1	a	People say this game is Pay To Win... But it's not, when i started to play this game i killed people that had Payed items which wasn't that difficult, However if you save money like me you can get really cool and good stuff from the shops in the game. For example if you spend real money on to the game its just giving stuff that looks better and its upgraded little bit too. I played this game for few hours and i am so close to get a really good car without spending no real life money. Hope this changed your mind about this game. :)
5997	1	a	Awesome game recommend playing it.
5999	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this with The Respectable Gentlemen Crew on Guardian Server. Lots of great times and laughs. 10/10 would play again.
6001	1	a	Kind of hard to get into the game, but when your in you can have some fun.   Not the best, but not the worst.
6003	1	a	I find APB Reloaded to be pleasantly suprising. It is more variable and fuller little details than i anticipated. The intensive tempo of game is enough to keep you playing for quite some time. If I should find something negative to say about this game it would be its poor documentation and confusing tutorial.  Even with this limitation I can recommend this game to anyone interested of this type of online action games.
6005	1	a	Imagine GTA but free
6007	1	a	cant recommend because i couldnt get it running ?/10
6009	1	a	good game over all great balanced f2p
6011	1	a	It's the best free game !!!
6013	1	a	You dont have p2w u just need some skills, but take time, now with the new patch the ahckers star to be bann and that is a progress because is more fair, this is a great game to paly with friends or to make new ones because many people are social, but a few are #####, in my opinion i love this game, but you need to try it before belive me
6015	1	a	0/10 Cant wear a bra as a man
6017	1	a	Start game. Be immediately greeted by the sales pitch and storefront splash page. Uninstall.
6019	1	a	It's fo free and it's off da heezy!
6021	1	a	One of those Free Games that you Don't want to miss out, And Btw, don't hesitate to buy premium definitely worth it. Goodluck my Fellow APB Players. If you are a Enforcer, prepare to get pwned.
6023	1	a	Very fun game, and in some aspects beats GTA...
6025	1	a	I've played first version of APB( with subscription like for one month or so) and it was poorer than this. Wow! Awesome FPS with open map. It's like GTA but smaller. I like whole 'in game'system and shoping. This game has only one defect - frustration when someone kills you! ahh
6027	1	a	APB Reloaded is a fun game in general, it's your basic shoot em up but it has a distinct twist of cops and robbers feel to it even though its just like any other game. What is realy surprising is that so much planning and detail went into it but the lag and the people running it our terrible. They gave up on the game but it's still fun to play if you deal with all the problems, its a load of fun especialy with friends and since its free, its a must have!  What stands out:  Fun with friends: 9/10 Lag level: 5/10 (thats bad btw) Design and Polishing: 8/10 OVERALL: a 7/10 but still worth playing! 
6029	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldn't find the stupid cake.
6031	1	a	I CANT PLAY IT . IT WILL NOT LET ME PLAY THE GAME
6033	1	a	doesnt work well not the best havent even been able to play it
6035	1	a	It's decent now that it's free and I HIGHLY reccommend you play with friends rather than alone.  Customization options are still awesome, though you're limited if you've got a free account. Not to say that you can't create something awesome with that though ;)  Of the free to play games I've played, the gun play in this game is great. It feels responsive enough to pull off pop-shots and quick swipes across your mousepad.  As for the guns themselves keep in mind that different weapons fill different roles. The game might not do a great job of teaching you what to do off the bat but it's fairly simple once you get used to it. i.e.: A SMG or shotgun will generally lose at range to an assault rifle; Assault rifles are good all-around. The starting rifle (STAR 556) is not to be underestimated, you can definitely outplay other 'paid'/'armas' guns with the right strategy.  Speaking of strategy, it plays a HUGE role in the game. A bit too much to explain in a little box here, but just remember to use the camera/third-person-view to your advantage, remember to check your flanks, and remember to stay in cover. As with any shooter, you'll have to learn the maps for the advantages each area holds, and how to counter them, how to flank them.   Once again, gaming is always fun with a friend, and for free? Sure, why not.
6037	1	a	Great free to play 
6039	1	a	If you can stick with the HUGE learning curve this game has, this is a real gem. The biggest problem with the game is the community. Find some nice friends in game, or a clan, talk to NOONE else, even turn off district chat. The shooting is fun, the missions are fun, the driving is fun. The game progression is OK, but slow, unless you have Premium.  I suggest if you like the game to get Premium, it's much more enjoyable ( for me at least ) to see progression happening at least daily, or semi-daily.  This game has VERY few aspects of P2W IF any ( arguable ), so as a F2P player, you can really keep up as well, but it's just slower to progress with contacts.  Again, if you can take the learning curve, and the community, it's a fun game. 
6041	1	a	SO MUCH FUN :D  This game may be a pay-to-win but just avoid the few players that pay to win and you will have a great time with mates. The more people you have working together the more entertaing it is ^_^
6043	1	a	IT HAS GUNS AND â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6045	1	a	i wish i could play it all i get is a black screen and i can see the main menu flashing.......i think
6047	1	a	Best game ever . GTA+Saints row + multiplayer = AWESOME!
6049	1	a	I do have an Alt which I have about 3k hours on, and by far this game is amazing. Except for some of the people I know, they're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. Plus, the hackers too, but Fairfight gets em'.   Def. Recomend this game.
6051	1	a	Game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T alot of the time but its unique in its own way. Lots of costumizations. i still love playing the game. i rage here and there but its nothing i still have fun
6053	1	a	good to play with friends
6055	1	a	very nice game
6057	1	a	the first game to come to mind when play ABP is gta5 online with the cosrimization of everything
6059	1	a	I love games where first of all you get to choose either female or male, but customization is key for me. Being able to control something like that is top notch already. But i love the feel of the game too. Flows nicely and i enjoy every step of the way.
6061	1	a	This is the best game on steam for free there are massive multiplayer and there are on your decision who you are Policeman?? Or gangster if you want game where you driving car in city and killing peopls this is must you chose
6063	1	a	I've played APB for about 2 years. I see alot of negative review concerning the game regarding poor matchmaking, bugs, hacking and most of all the community. To be honest I could not see APB nor could I enjoy playing it the same way if it weren't for those things. You are in a game where you can make yourself look however you want. Literally I've seen people walk around gunning people with what looked like underwear with a giant brown stain and a party hat. I've seen people paint masterpieces on the sides of cars and vans alike. I've seen people put so much detail in their characters they stand out no matter what. Everyone stands out somehow. You have your own personal touch that people will recognize. Your shirt, your car, your tie, your makeup or a tattoo. The customization on this game is endless and you can even make your own MIDI songs ingame. Sure they won't be pop quality songs but how many games can do that today in the MMO field?   Matchmaking is good the way it is simply because there are people who are on a higher tier than other players and pick on the newbies. This game is brutal concerning that one detail... Its f*** or die and granted that is sad but this is not a game that will spoon feed you skills nor will it hold your hand till you can walk by yourself. You can't just click a button or two to make your problems disappear. The more you play the more you will understand that it all comes down to two things. Skill and teamwork, with an emphasis on teamwork. The hardest, toughest mother*****r can be killed with teamwork that is guaranteed. However there will be times when its all you under the spotlight vs three other people and only 30 seconds left on the clock to finish the mission... You will probably fail but sometimes you will be able to shine. Once you put such a high bar in a game the satisfaction of winning is increased ten fold.  Now regarding the community... I want everyone for just a moment to understand something. This is a game where you either pretend to be a criminal or a vigilante (neither have a problem killing pedetrians at will). Its also an FPS game with things like 'lootable' money. Also let us not forget this is the internet... Do you really think everyone is gona be nice or play nice? People will insult you, they will hate you, they will bother you, hell if they could they would perma crash all your cars, steal your money and leave you without clothes. However... Every world is the same town, there are good people and there are bad people. I've met decent human being on APB who were not hell bent on defecating on your gaming experience. The community of APB in my mind is exactly how San Pedro would be if such a situation ever existed. Besides I personal find satisfaction being s**t talked by the entire opposition for 30min after I win the game.   To conclude this game is not for everyone and it requires a bit getting used to. If you read this review and decide to give it a shot don't worry about sucking at this game. Even after you become the proest of them all, to someone (or a few people) you will always be a 'noob' ;).  9/10 They don't get my full vote because I'd very much like to see new maps from time to time xD
6065	1	a	Oh god it hurts to much to play but it's a good pain UGHN END MY LIFE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AAAGH
6067	1	a	despite what people think about this game, i think its alright. one thing that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off though is that, i was making a design for a shirt, and it was pretty intracate, took me a few hours. then after all that hard work, i came to find that there were only 3 slots for items that you could add. yea. i was raging inside, but ya know, just gotta accept it. pisses me off how they do that, but want the money any way they can get it. i dont know, i was thinking of buying some in game stuff for it, but the way it did that to me, makes me feel kinda iffy.
6069	1	a	Awesome game. Very open worlded and customizable. Definitley get it.
6071	1	a	Quick fun gameplay, right from the begin!
6073	1	a	I have just one question. How hard is it to make controller support? very shameful
6075	1	a	Regardless of the amount of people shouting pay to win, the game is somewhat enjoyable. The only downside for me is living in South Africa and not getting a good latency. If you looking for some gang related time to waste this is your game
6077	1	a	Been playing this game on and off for years, and finally something somewhere was fixed and I can FINALLY play the game without server lag like I had all the time before. Now to get right into what I think and what you should/shouldn't expect.    If you're into a great balanced, and fair battle system, please stray as far away as possible from this game. APB has arguably the most back@ssed, unfair and poorly balanced gun mechanics I've ever seen in a game. I mean you could shoot the enemy in the face 10 times with a pistol and they won't die, I have literally hit people point black 100% accuracy with grenades and they took no damage and when they throw one in my general direction I went flying. The driving mechanics are also all miss, not even close to hitting but it gets the job done. Physics in this game do NOT EXIST. The missions get repetitive after a while, but you realize how much you need to do them to unlock everything so you'll have to bare with it. The matchmaking is also pretty terrible since there is no skill matching (at least that does its job) or level/rank system, so if you're starting out, have fun dying A LOT from people who have either been playing for a while and have better stuff than you or are hackers. That's another thing, this game is kinda old, and I feel like the developer just doesn't care much more about security so there are plenty of hackers.   Really, I'm sure by now you're probably going 'wow this game sounds like it sucks bad' but let me give you my reasoning as to why this is still one of the most interesting and worthwhile (for a little while at least) MMO's around.    Customization. This game does it better than any game around, unless maybe you're playing Black Desert or Sims 4. Absolutely amazing customization options for detailed character creation, tattoos, cars, custom music, all kinds of armor options, and more. Honestly I would consider this more of a social simulator with guns and cars than an actual third-person shooter MMO, since the focus on the personal and social aspects seem to carry a bit more weight. Graphically the game has held up surprisingly really well. One of the more pretty games you'll see from the last generation of MMO's (obviously no match for something like ArcheAge, Black Desert or Dirty Bomb though (but who really cares)) Another maybe little but big to me thing that I love is that you can import your own music from your computer into your in-game radio to listen to in the car which adds a nice bit of immersion, and yes I know I could just open up Spotify, but I just like having it this way.   If you go into this game expecting GTA or Saints Row quality gameplay, you'll be surely disappointed. This isn't bad though. This game doesn't really try to BE either of the two. If you love having vast and unique customization tools and just trying something other than the typical cookie-cutter MMORPG/FPS give it a try. Don't just go in for 30 minutes, really give it a good few hours, learn the game, unlock some stuff and feel it out. It may or may not be for you.
6079	1	a	Great game.
6081	1	a	Playing this game til GTA comes almost as good as GTA!
6083	1	a	Good game, basicly is GTA multiplayer where you can choose cops insted of gangsters xD wepons could be better!
6085	1	a	Nice game!
6087	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME  
6089	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed Game
6091	1	a	This is by far the greatest rage inducing game I have ever played. You can customize your character to look like just about anything, or make your character into your own unique personality. You can do this same with your vehicles. I have 750+ hours in this game, not just through steam. Most of it was spent customizing, just because you can get very detailed with it. If you have not tried this game, I highly recommend it, but be warned it is not easy and you will rage a lot.
6093	1	a	Best online 3PS game by now
6095	1	a	it is fun 
6097	1	a	Great game
6099	1	a	I LOVE IT, is like A..... GTA game unless is just MP and is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ loads with friends :D
6101	1	a	APB. Thats it.
6103	1	a	Funny game. Get's boring after awhile since the missions are the same. Alot of hackers once you are gold threat.
6105	1	a	Like FTP GTA, Hoping Rockstar will be able to do something like this one day.
6107	1	a	If you like an open based world, customizable characters and vehicles, and plenty a guns to choose from. this is youre game. you can pick to be a good cop, bad cop, or just a criminal. the choice is yours.
6109	1	a	Loads of potential, ruined by hackers, overpowered pay-to-win weapons, and a lack of excitement. This could've been an amazing game if it weren't for repetetive, unbalanced missions and hackers. There's also not much else to do while free-roaming. There's great customization, though. But that's about all APB Reloaded has to offer.
6111	1	a	Graphics 5/10 Average Story and tasks 2/10 Boring... Gun Play 4/10 I seen way better. Like BF and GTA and COD. Controls 8/10 Way easy to learn. Fun 4/10 Lots of grinding.   So average!! 5/10
6113	1	a	Spent three hours making a sticker 18/10
6115	1	a	i dont care about the rating or other reviews. this game is what i'd call the second gta 5 online. its great and its for the computer which i'd call a cool game so argue all u want about this i still say this needs more people
6117	1	a	Awesome game. MMO version of Grand Theft Auto.
6119	1	a	APB Reloaded is a very nice game to play with friends to experience the fun of the game to the fullest! I highly recommend this game if you want to experience what GTA online would be like! You and your friends might enjoy it!
6121	1	a	It's a fun game to play with 1 or more friends but alone It's not as fun. Still a great game.
6123	1	a	i cant download the game 
6125	1	a	The best online game ever. You must play it if you like GTA IV or Saints Row etc. Very good game, and finally its free to play. EVERYONE MUST PLAY THIS KICKASS GAME
6127	1	a	this game rocks men but there is a problem with the internet conection i dont think is my computer problem who i m must to ask to find uot what is wronk 
6129	1	a	I like it...its fun...play it....yep
6131	1	a	Good Game but only downside is you need a good computer to get alright fps. Some Servers are very small and you get to know alot of people good but really bad mission pairing. I give a 7/10.
6133	1	a	Amazing F2P grand theft auto type game love the fact you can also play as the police or criminals and even upload your itunes music and play it in your car! :D
6135	1	a	Closest game to gta I have ever had   9 out of 10
6137	1	a	its sort of fun
6139	1	a	it's awsome
6141	1	a	Be who you can't be.
6143	1	a	idk if is good game have not play it but it look fun it almost look like gta5 in a way
6145	1	a	seriously, wtf are you doing reading this? PLAY THIS GAME!!  APB is an online 3rd person â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t simulator.  Hours of fun can be had and sometimes you just cant help yelling 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T!' at your screen as you get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ handed to you.  Though nothing beats the feeling of rolling in a car through the city with some good friends who you know got your back.
6147	1	a	great , love it
6149	1	a	this is a fun action pack game it is hands down the best PvP game i have played on Steam.
6151	1	a	cant start it 
6153	1	a	This game could be a good replacement for GTA if you get past the lagging when you drive !!
6155	1	a	i love this game
6157	1	a	some times it does not work ama try again
6159	1	a	Nice game, i've been playing as a criminal
6161	1	a	the game never launches for me =(
6163	1	a	Its pretty good but can be improved 
6165	1	a	For some reson i love this game. the first time i played i didnt like the game that mach but i really recomend it to people that love being cool and are really good with art (on computers of cors) and for people that don't like killing but making money of the marcketplays thats it
6167	1	a	
6169	1	a	If you like playing GTA with forgeign, children, and hackers this game is for you!
6171	1	a	Pretty Good if you get used to it, no real pay2win and alot of options for free players.
6173	1	a	this game is really fun i you can make your car make your own chacter you can mug people theres drug missions i mean the game is like saints row dont listen to any body that dosent like it they might be gay im just saying you can have clans gourps and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ oh whatever you do dont pic cop its not that fun lol i made my chacter as a old asin guy thats fat and whereing just his underwear lol
6175	1	a	When I first downloaded this game I jumped straight into it and have played it for 62 hours in total, it has its ups and downs. But also holds a great downside which is where newbies are being put up against veterans/experienced players. This could be fixed by adding 3 servers, one for low levelled players, one for higher levelled players and another one for mixed players where low levelled players can still go up against higher levelled players, this would be good because you could have a friend who is a much higher level than you when you're only level 1, you can just jump straight into the mixed server and join him/her
6177	1	a	THIRD BEST F2P GAME ON STEAM 100 PERCENT LEGIT
6179	1	a	Not enough guinea pigs
6181	1	a	GTA Online before it was cool.
6183	1	a	Read stuff, adn you are perfect at the game, a couple of mintutes of me running around mugging people a girl askd me if I needed help and she showed me how to play the game! robbed people, killed cops and earned about over 10000 dollars in mintutes! so just play the game and ask for help!
6185	1	a	An absolute and horrid waste of time if you're looking to play something for fun. Cheaters, griefers, whiners and a horribly mismatched matchmaking system. Lag even in the same state as the server, a community typical to free MMO's (children and trolls), and a frustrating grind for simple items.  If you can get past all the negatives, the game has a decently fun fighting system when it isn't pitting you against a horribly imbalanced enemy; the customization is absolutely wonderful, if not lacking in just one or two things; and there's a little bit of charm to the characters and their backstories.  By the way, this isn't a game for lower spec computers.  In general, if you have the patience to deal with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t after â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, or can aim very well... This is a great game
6187	1	a	Good game to play at random moments. Like gta 5 but in a simply version
6189	1	a	This Game Is Not As Good as U May Think But It's Similar To Saints Row 3 and Grand Theft Auto Except You Have The Choice Of Playing As Good At The Start Or Bad:Fighting Against Crime Or Fighting AlongSide Crime Of Course I Chose To be Good :D But Yeah This Game Is Basically Grand Theft Auto Etc. Rating:6/10
6191	1	a	sucky â™¥â™¥â™¥ pay to win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6193	1	a	love this game, honestly thought it would be bad but it is so amazingly fun to play with mates or by urself.
6195	1	a	Loved this before and after f2p great game with friends
6197	1	a	I'm going to try and get back into this with the new 'Revolutionary' anti-hack system, I can't say it'll be as good as it used to be. But..........I can hope. And it probably won't be &gt;:/. I recommend people to at least give it another go. I guess.
6199	1	a	one problem is figuring out wht weapon you want because it dosent show weather it is semi burst or full auto
6201	1	a	This game is like free cancer
6203	1	a	Best shooter i have ever played
6205	1	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
6207	1	a	Makes grand theft auto look like sesame street
6209	1	a	It's Saints Row 2 minus the shenanigans and the purchase price.
6211	1	a	Alot of fun! Competitive, alot of room to be creative, and is a good challenge to constantly be on your game and get the advantage over your enemies, I love playing this game, it's personally my favorite free to play game on Steam
6213	1	a	Cops and Robbers, the MMO. The price is certainly right and like TF2 you can have a fun time without spending a dime. The customization is pretty amazing and shows just how much time went into making this game; making it's lack of initial success back in 2010 all the more sad. You can play in a group or on your own, it's all good.
6215	1	a	Really fun, more friends you play with the more fun this game can be.
6217	1	a	the best game but kicking me all time plz fix it
6219	1	a	Basically GTA f2p
6221	1	a	is apb reloded available for apple computers
6223	1	a	EPIC GAME so much fun GET IT its free!
6225	1	a	Absolutely Love this game, takes combat to a whole new level.
6227	1	a	apb is a really fun game it provides lots of customization and u can go out on the streets of san paro with friends and start doing missions or just fool around its up 2 u.
6229	1	a	This game is the bomb! Must Must Must play
6231	1	a	Fun game. Still getting used to it.
6233	1	a	Good game not as good as a GTA but i still give it a thumbs up but the only problem is the 30 mins it takes to load it.
6235	1	a	I like this game because its very good action, more than more weapon, and its pretty!
6237	1	a	Great game, when the server isn't lagging or matchmaking is broken or you end up facing a hacker. But the customization is great visuals are cool and combat is fun if you can get used to it and the driving.
6239	1	a	If you can aim at all, prepare to be called a hacker after killing a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off white kid
6241	1	a	My â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6243	1	a	pritty fun game reminds me of gta 5
6245	1	a	Good game but full of cheeters... :(  is good to play...
6247	1	a	Still one of my Favorite games to play, it's F2P and has lots of action and fun  Wacky physics, great gun play  Smart strategy and skill is key to become a gold level player  New players can easily dominate vets if you have the skill and ability to stay calm and play smart  APB:R atleast try it!
6249	1	a	Launcher has lots of errors
6251	1	a	The customization on APB:R is insane, you can make your vehicles and character look any way you would like. For the most part the missions are fun if you can overlook all of the server lag (Joker-East) and the OP weapons that you can purchase through the in game market with real money. I have put a ton of hours into this game and as much as I hate playing it with the server lag/hacker issues it is still a really fun game to play. *I am not calling everyone a cheater either but there are a select few that still roam the joker server every now and again.* I would recommend this to anyone that was wondering about it because it can be a really fun game to play if you really have nothing else to do.
6253	1	a	why can't this game ever be good? 
6255	1	a	its game good 
6257	1	a	This game is AWESOME, been playing it for almost a year now. Ppl who read this. DOWNLOAD AND PLAY IT! :D
6259	1	a	BEST game EVER
6261	1	a	2/10  - Interesting gameplay - Imba cash shop - Cash sink
6263	1	a	Do you like spending real money over and over agian on the same game? Well this one is for YOU!! Friends are needed to play and have fun IMO, being the cops can be quite dull most times, and the crooks are ballin. The power of the darkside is everywhere, no one should be able to survive. He runs the underworld with a deathly fist. Why you ask, because it's raining .... raining upon my teary eyed face with no way to tell if you are Dead or Alive?!
6265	1	a	Pay to win. 9/11
6267	1	a	If you have some friends to play with, APB Reloaded gives one many hours of great gameplay. Unfortunately some decisions from the developers give a hint that developers' name 'Gamersfirst' leads to a false point of view.
6269	1	a	Awsome game!
6271	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME!! I love everything about this game! I play it with my bro all the time and we are obssesed. I totally recommend this game. The only bad things about this game is 1. Mine takes SSOO long to open and play APB, but this isn't their fault, my computer just isn't very good. 2. Everything in the store on the Social District is so expensive! Again, not their fault. Players just sell items in the game for ridiculous amount of money xD
6273	1	a	IS THE BEST GAME IN WOLD 
6275	1	a	Prefect game, Just needs a touch up with Gun combat then it will be prefect!!
6277	1	a	nice game now with the anti hackor cheat system
6279	1	a	ok if GTA met pc for free here it is you get to choose either crinimal or enforcer thats up to you the game is good but lag issues are a major issue
6281	1	a	this game is well made and its fun to play and blow tings up
6283	1	a	This is an overall great game with all its fun.
6285	1	a	i would really recommend this game for players of the crackdown and crackdown 2 xbox 360 games because there really alike 
6287	1	a	Best dress up game ever made. Also really fun to play with bros for a while.
6289	1	a	No, I actually canÂ´t recommend this game to anyone. In the beginning youÂ´ll get kill-farmed by the veterans, the mission design is repetitive and the community is the worst IÂ´ve ever seen. Still, IÂ´ve played almost 450 hours with my two chars, so there has to be something with this game... Enjoy!^^
6291	1	a	Love the game! Just wished fairfight would do more work :D 
6293	1	a	can u fix the lag
6295	1	a	APB Reloaded has been retuned since it's initial relaunch and the game has a lot to offer. Not a perfect title, but worlds better than it used to be and very fun with tons of customization. No PvE, the game is entirely PvP so be prepared.
6297	1	a	this is the version of GTA. it is holy fun
6299	1	a	Ya this is a kool experience in itself.
6301	1	a	Me and my one friend were driving after this package in the enemy's car and there was a guy on to of the car who had a rocket launcher and blew us up.  69/10
6303	1	a	Well this game is great things that are premium are just about the same as the ones you can buy through earning my biggest problem is that all the cars in this game even the premium ones are so hard to drive and in a mission some times get paired up with pros and guys who pay to win which is unfair.
6305	1	a	Improved from original, people are actually playing it. Fun, however this game is a major â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ magnet. Play, don't give a damn, and you'll have a blast. Outside of the lag spikes on both east and west coast servers...a worthwhile venture into MMO 'Cops &amp; Robbers'..
6307	1	a	Overall good,graphics are good,even if you lower it,customizations is cool,aiming is a bit weird,driving is very bad,i prefer playing on foot,as for playing mission,well for a new player it's really hard to figure out what to do &amp; where to go...when playing in multiplayer,the cool thing is that it doesn't lag even if your internet is slow...so it's 6/10
6309	1	a	When I played the Closed Beta in late 2009, it was a really cool game. But when Realtime Worlds, the makers of the game, went down, Gamersfirst took over the game and made it Free-to-play. It is now a pure pay-to-win game with extreme bonuses that are included in the premium membership etc. It's almost impossible to enjoy the game if you're not a premium user.   But hey, give it a try - it's not a bad game afterall!
6311	1	a	this game is so fun 
6313	1	a	I would really LOVE to play this game. The character customizeation proves to help you make a unique character and vehicle. But there some downsides in which i should mention... 1. No sign of australian servers. Im from Sydney, so that means playing on a US server is like playing with alot of viruses in your pc. and i mean ALOT. 2. AIs. Yes, the AIs are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, like. Very Very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But really, the fun youll be getting out of this is the players. Which is another problem. 3. Players. There really isn't alot of people on the servers, Exept for like, one US server. The rest of the servers are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing empty nearly, i saw a server with 4 people on. Get this is mind, one server PER country, no, one server IN US AND BRAZIL. 4. P2W. Or Pay to Win. Lets get this straight. I, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing, Hate, pay to win games. Sure, it can be fun to play f2p games, but when it comes to that point when you keep getting killed by the same noob who bought a shotgun for 10 dollars. Its just not fair. I have no problem with pay to win games like planetside 2, because the stock weapons are newbie-friendly. But the stock weapons on APB reloaded is just, No... 5. Car mechanics. Oh god where do i begin? You know those frustrating Ice physics you see in games? Its sort of like that. but this time, you driving a car on an ice-skating rink painted black and white with a bit of yellow. Its that bad, like REALLY bad. IDk if its just ther server problems i mentioned earlier or just a bug the developers cant be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed fixing.  Overall, these are just badsides, the customizeations is something deffinately worth playing this game for. i'd say 5/10. If you have spare time, give this game a ride.
6315	1	a	APB Reloaded is (even) great(er) to play if a) you're an elite FPS b) have a top end computer.   Since I am neither I enjoyed spectating missions, getting booted and continually and unintentionally having my vehicles blow up due to poor driving.  Highly recommended.
6317	1	a	Awesome Game But The Update Doseint Make Me Play The Game :(
6319	1	a	pay to win but is a really cool game
6321	1	a	I love this game and the fairness it provides to all players. Looking for a fun fair game with instant gameplay? This is it. It's like GTA V without limits. Play with me on the 'Colby' Server and be a criminal- my name is Drakonite; pm me!
6323	1	a	Because far out character creation, actual teamplay, and shooting stuff.
6325	1	a	there were several bugs, but now its awesome! :3  cool with friends
6327	1	a	This game used to be an ultimate battle of Good vs. Bad. When it first came out, you would log into a world of chaos as criminals and enforcers were shooting, driving, looting, and running everywhere. The experience of logging in and knowing what was awaiting me was a thrill. When it became free to play, I returned to it and had the same excitement going in. Now, it seems the game has begun its decline. You have to be lucky to find a decent amount of people online and when you do they are mostly criminals. It has basically became an online single player game which makes the missions feel very repetitive. Even though this is a negative I have with the game, I personally dont think it's the game's fault. The game is still fun to play, the missions are fun if you have someone to play them with, and the customization of clothing and vehicles in APB is amazing. If you havent played this game before, I strongly suggest giving it a try.
6329	1	a	This game is a great game if you have the Patience!
6331	1	a	This Game would be more fun , if it have boat or motorcycle
6333	1	a	Its ok but... IT WONT EVER LOAD FOR ME!!!!!! Im still going to give it a thumbs up becuase i only played 1 min of it and i got scared so i accidently shut it down but what i did do in that first minute was fun.
6335	1	a	WTF!!!!!  Best game I have played in a LONG time, and the game is an endless world of Murder and Missions, along with ULTRA Customization for Cars, Clothes and Facial/Body features.
6337	1	a	one of the best mmos ive ever played!!!!
6339	1	a	At first it's boring but once you get a good character on it it's quite fun.
6341	1	a	/spoiler This game was ok...hard to launch
6343	1	a	I didn't do a single mission. I just customize my character all day. 11/10
6345	1	a	Very fun. Didn't like it in the first time but I am now loving it.
6347	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME. NO KIDDING. see the hours... multiply that by 5 and u have my total overall
6349	1	a	Pros + You can do all what you want in this game. There are lots of futures. ITÂ´s NOT Pay2Win, because you can play very well with â€žSTAR-556 or N-TECâ€œ from the beginning. You can buy also every car with Ingame-Cash or Joker-Ticket. You can also buy R195 modifications for 250 Joker-Ticket.  Cons - The Game needs very high system requirements. ItÂ´s very teambased game. AND lots of cheaters and macro players. 
6351	1	a	spent all my money on cars
6353	1	a	Good game a crap load of bugs, for instance it won't even install.
6355	1	a	its cool but not that cool 
6357	1	a	Played...  Died...  Spent Money...  Couldn't stop even when things got bad...  Things got better...  Became a 'somebody as one of the trailers suggests...  Spent more money...  Satisifed with the 600 dollars spent on this game and the endless customisation.
6359	1	a	This is the best game ever in my opinion any way I recommend this at a 5 Star rate
6361	1	a	When you are playing alone you will suffer in agony so get a friend. Then you both can suffer.  10/10 best heroin simulator
6363	1	a	Nice game to play. 9.5/10
6365	1	a	Love this game. PLayed it for years.
6367	1	a	Nice game :D
6369	1	a	playing this until gta v comes out...
6371	1	a	love it but is not leting me play anymore 
6373	1	a	This game is legit! i've had so much fun playing it! and its addicting to play 
6375	1	a	awesome fun.Lots of players andd missions.customizing is amazing
6377	1	a	Great game &lt;3
6379	1	a	If im being completely honest here, it's one of the most exciting games ive ever played. Yes At low levels and if you dont purchase items for the sellers it's quite hard to win missions but even the basic details like driving and looting bring a smile to my face
6381	1	a	cooooool nice games of open world games
6383	1	a	This game has a good idea about it but they need to sort out the level difference in lobbys 
6385	1	a	Good Game but has very poor matchmaking and slow game development, even still it's probably the best game of cops and robbers you will play and it's totally free.
6387	1	a	Heavily reliant on your RAM. Synchronization is server-based rather than client based, so when you press W it takes an extra half second for you to move forward. Once you get used to the slight lag, it's a wicked good game dude.
6389	1	a	This game is pretty cool for a realistic shooter.. doing crime is fun I haven't tried the Police yet.. its a bit too hard to shoot other players and I rarly played it enough for all the space it took on my pc so i uninstalled.. it was Enjoyable tho
6391	1	a	Its pretty good once you know how to get costum stuff very unique engines of creating stuff, You get very confused for a bit at the start but it gets really good! kinda reminds me about GTA
6393	1	a	Let me start off with the word: 'wow...'  This game has stolen so much out of my time. But in the good way of course!  I have played APB: R for a COUNTLESS amount of hours. I met tons of nice people, that I eventually have become really good friends with outside the game.   The game has TONS of customization and replay value. The missions start getting repetitive, but the players and the gameplay of the different players make it so much different every time. I love it!  The game runs smoothly, but you do need a bit of a strong PC to play it. If you have problems over steam, I would suggest you to download the standalone from Gamersfirst themselves and add  APB Advanced Launcer  [forums.gamersfirst.com]  to it. It allows you with tons of more customization for your graphical settings than the game can give you. Props to the guy who made it!  Rounding up, 9/10. The game has its flaws, but I love the game with them. It wouldn't be the same fun without them! Cheers Gamersfirst for picking up a dead game and making it free to play! (the game died after a subscription model, but got brought up again)
6395	1	a	pay to win but is a really cool game
6397	1	a	APB is the only game that I never get bored of. I've been playing this for about 3 years now, and although I don't play it all the time anymore, I still jump on every once in a while, and then remember how great this game is.  They are always adding new stuff and its such a simple idea. You do missions against other teams over and over, but due to the size of the map, the weapons availalble and how fun it is, you never get bored. Get this game now
6399	1	a	10/10 would uninstall again
6401	1	a	JUST THUG LIFE!
6403	1	a	this game is hilarious you can do any thing you want to... also you can choose what thing you want to be... by that I mean that you can either be a criminal or you can be a cop it is clearly your choice... aswell as doing this you can customise your character an way you want to... this game I recommend it is brilliant... well that is what I think at least 
6405	1	a	It's a good game.
6407	1	a	I get in game do a mission and get rekt by kits that paid for guns that are better using their moms credit card. 10/10 would get rekt again
6409	1	a	Made my character look as much like me as possible, 5 min. loading screen, entered game.  No matter what you do, your character will look like they've just done heroin 500 times. 10/10 what will you look like on drugs simulator
6411	1	a	Very well made game and also can be extremely addictive,there will be a little lag now and then but its acceptable and not to bad
6413	1	a	There has to be 10,000+ more things to do. I started a long time ago and still havent finished, Customize Vehicles and yourself, You can pick 1 side, theres 2, Thug or Police Choose your fate, grab your gun.
6415	1	a	Fun game espiaclly with lots of friends
6417	1	a	Oh my god this is amazing! The action! The excitement! The love! The scenary! The time!                           I got from uninstalling this
6419	1	a	This game is actually really fun once you get past the steep learning curve. It will put you through hell in the start but once you get used to it things do get a lot better. The only downside is the hackers that run around but they are rare to run into. Just play for fun and and all is well.  I have to edit this review because although it can be a fun game, and it's not necessarily a bad game, this game is dated. There's supposedly going to be an engine upgrade and it seems like it's never coming but it's suppose to be soon. And with that, more bugs! The few things this game lacks is innovation and optimization. Match making is terrible, guns are hardley ever balanced and servers are still not up to par.  I'm still recommending this game for those wishing to play something with a GTA Online feel that's free to play.
6421	1	a	A great game of skill, stragagy and car surfing! I highly recomend this game to anyone.
6423	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥o 
6425	1	a	Been playing since 2010, just got it on Steam, great as ever!
6427	1	a	I get in game do a mission and get rekt by kits that paid for guns that are better using their moms credit card. 10/10 would get rekt again
6429	1	a	great game  
6431	1	a	suck my healthy nuts
6433	1	a	a great game but a bit laggy for me but its a awsome game
6435	1	a	Fun game to play. Highly Customizable. However it does get repetivive. Recomended to play with Friends
6437	1	a	When you are playing alone you will suffer in agony so get a friend. Then you both can suffer.  10/10 best heroin simulator
6439	1	a	Makes me wanna flip off myself for installing it
6441	1	a	This game gets me rock hard.
6443	1	a	this game is realy fun so i will give it a thumbs up the only down sides to this game is the 50 minute time it takes to load and the lag
6445	1	a	great game ive always wanted grand theft auto v but this can work the same as it so yeah 
6447	1	a	Typically pay 2 win... BUT it has a big pile of good content!
6449	1	a	u cant do any of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u see in the trailer but if u dont have money and u need a free to play game this is ok
6451	1	a	Awesome game, free version of GTA? probably.. yes sometimes you might get mad at this game but think again, at least your playing something. 
6453	1	a	GTA V for free .
6455	1	a	Stands for Action Police Brain.
6457	1	a	Not a bad game its just too fun and addicting
6459	1	a	I'm McLovin this games ! Once. Been a long while since I login. Gettin n00b. I will be back. Much customization in games and fun gameplay. One of the best customize I ever encounter. Need a good teamwork or frens to truly enjoy the games though.
6461	1	a	Started the game up, then got chased by a group of yellow cars and a yellow van.  10/10
6463	1	a	this is a fun action pack game it is hands down the best PvP game i have played on Steam.
6465	1	a	Fly around a big city, act like a gangster, pwn noobs trying to break the law, GG.
6467	1	a	I love this game and would highly recommend it to my friends (if they're not already playing it) and want to delve into it more, unfortunately, I need to switch over to a 64 bit system in order to play it properly.
6469	1	a	Despite the AWFUL AWFUL start out and cruelty towards newbies, but once you force yourself through a veritable HELL in the game it eventually calls to you in a way that says 'play me some more, play me some more, you will like it once you play it long enough' which seems to be the case for me, but the lag spikes are kinda irritating and if you have a really under performing NON-gaming computer, you'll have a HELL of a time trying to play this game!
6471	1	a	When I first downloaded this game I jumped straight into it and have played it for 62 hours in total, it has its ups and downs. But also holds a great downside which is where newbies are being put up against veterans/experienced players. This could be fixed by adding 3 servers, one for low levelled players, one for higher levelled players and another one for mixed players where low levelled players can still go up against higher levelled players, this would be good because you could have a friend who is a much higher level than you when you're only level 1, you can just jump straight into the mixed server and join him/her
6473	1	a	it ruined my life
6475	1	a	Spent 4 hours Ram Raiding and mugging Got caught by an Enforcer Tried my best to escape Died Watched,how enforcer stole all my money Lost Took a mission Won Got a spray paint as a reward Went ram raiding again Bought a gun for 10 days Took another mission Got rekt by a guy with a Machine Gun Lost Game crashed Could not login for 4 days On 5th day I logged in It said that mine account does not exist 11/10 Would kill myself again
6477	1	a	Wish there was a neutral recommendation button. This game is a lot better when played with friend, that's for sure. They can help you play the game and it makes the overall experience of that game much more enjoyable. Not exactly new-comer friendly, so be prepared to have your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ handed to you. A lot. But, the missions are quite enjoyable, and I found myself enjoying this game quite a bit. I'd recommend playing it if you're curious, but be prepared to get killed when first starting out. Go ahead and give the game a shot!
6479	1	a	Really good free to play game and Specially if u like shoot guns and drive cars designe cars designe a caracther or more!
6481	1	a	This game has come a long way since its early stages. I hope you guys give this MMO a shot cuz its pretty dang good and if you do look me up ill most definately be loggin in the hrs on this one!
6483	1	a	When I first started playing APB few months ago I wouldn't have recommended it as it was a lot of gold tier players stomping me every mission but they have added new match making which has me playing against other silvers and I'm actually having fun. The combat in this game is very fast paced like GTA 2 or 3 in fact specific weapon types are made to run and gun rather then usual iron sight shooting I'm used to. The cars are also realy fun to drive around and the physics of crashing them together can be hilarious at times especially with the heavier vehicles.   I should note that if you don't have the paid subscription (premium) that the very very good clothing/tattoo/body modifications are severely limited to the point where you will won't get the crazy details you see in most screenshots. The same applies to cars though even with subscription it is still much more limited then player models.  The game is free to play so you have nothing to lose to just jump in and run over and or shoot people to see if it's something you can play for a while there's no hidden pay wall or 'pay 2 win' though they do sell guns and some are a lot easier to use then the default weapon but skill plays a lot into it.
6485	1	a	Has lots of problems, mostly created by G1. Fun though. Lots of potential.
6487	1	a	Ok. So you like grand theft auto? Do you like MMO's? Cause if so, this Free-to-play game is a fun one. Its a very skillful game is a lot of fun to play. Now with all F2P games, there is a paying part to it. But listen to me, the paying to win part is not that bad as other games. In this game, for most paying purposes, it would give that SAID player a Advantage to OTHER players. In this game, I like to think of it as the COC iOS game. You can do it all legit, or you can pay for shortcuts. Those guys who kill you and seem so good? Its cause they have 1000 hrs+ alts and have spent ACCOUNT PREMIUM stuff. Now if you start out BRAND new, you will have Abosoutly have no idea what your doing, but it does have a VERY rewarding tutorial. Anyway The real P2W part about this game is the PREMIUM. Yes just Premium. This 'Premium' is alot more powerful than people think. This P2W aspect makes you make your normal cash, normal contact XP (XP) and THEN, the EXACT same amount with a 50% increase added to it. so in all, its like your getting a 150% increase in your stuff. Anyway, enough rambling, this is a VERY good game, giving people free Codes to enter and enjoy some of the P2W stuff. Now this is the kind of game that you either like or dont, but there are so really dumb aspects to it. Anyway, overall Good game. The P2W's and Smurfs (CS:GO Lingo meaning alters) kind of make it hard to join in. But this game is very skillful and, if you get some friends, its ALOT of fun.   ------Stay Awsome-----
6489	1	a	This is the best game ever in my opinion any way I recommend this at a 5 Star rate
6491	1	a	super cool game, awesome gameplay and style. there is a awesome comunnity if you arent good at the game cause if you rek people you hack. but there is a good antihack system in this game so hackers are rare. i can totaly recomand this game, find a clan with teamspeak and you can spend years on this game.
6493	1	a	Be who you can't be.
6495	1	a	...
6497	1	a	This game rocks. There isn't a better free play game out there
6499	1	a	very fun open world game kinda like grand theft auto!
6501	1	a	I just mess up all the other people's stuff, like 1. he parked down his car next to the mission building 2. I crash into his car 3. everybody yays   oh me :(
6503	1	a	The customization is pretty cool on here, I believe.
6505	1	a	... Pay to the win.  
6507	1	a	Crim teams full of cheaters. Crashes all the time. Guns work for others but not for you. Free to play.
6509	1	a	Friend submitted support ticket and it was resolved within 30 mins. That kind of response is amazing enough to outweigh any cons of the game, if there were any.
6511	1	a	Not Recommended for people who don't understand that this is just a game.
6513	1	a	Spawned in my friend Mr Super Swag Money picked me up in this grey van and we drove around the hole city in the van running into shops and stealing tv's. 9,5/10 pretty fun game.
6515	1	a	Its a really fun game, u can play as a cop or criminal, I perfer criminals
6517	1	a	come try this game out with me! my name in game= Mimistacy (enforcer) its not that populair but a bunch of ppl still play it! super fun game and rek ppl on and also costume ur own cool car/costumes (see my screenshots of APB)  HAVE FUN xxx
6519	1	a	awesome game, hope it would repopulate because of the long matchmaking queues
6521	1	a	I think this is a quite enjoyable multiplayer game. It's especially fun when you have friends do do it with, as there are missoins to complete in-game and a nice, fun free-roam outside of the missions
6523	1	a	great game
6525	1	a	why is the gun play still so bad in this game, no such thing as accuracy at any distance and no patern at all. The best example being, assult rifle at close range kills full health enemy instant even when they have a high power shotty and fired first, the next day same senario but at a distance with shotty killing enemy with full health out side of shotty range. Love the rest of the game but the gun play is maddening at best with its lack of consistency...... i recommend only based on customization only.
6527	1	a	 Click Here to go to their website  [www.gamersfirst.com] 
6529	1	a	fun, good customization, pleanty of cars, lots of clothing,customization scrolls, etc.
6531	1	a	APB Reloaded is an alright game.. it feels kinda like GTA's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cousin. Its biggest problems is pay-2-win and matchmaking. 6/10
6533	1	a	Very addicting, even if it's a bit repetitive. Admittedly it's hard to progress without premium once you get to a certain point, and a lot of the premium weapons are overpowered, but not to the point where you NEED them to do well. Admittedly, I haven't played in over a year, so this may have changed.
6535	1	a	Really enjoyed this game, Does have abit of a pay to win feel to it sometimes but other then that I'd give it about a 9 out of 10, Now i just have to wait and see if the rumors about a PS4 and XboxOne release are true or not.
6537	1	a	Now i dont really like many MMO's but this... is just AMAZING I just wish they would kinda stop thy lagg, if they havent really.
6539	1	a	Awesome Game (Y) :3
6541	1	a	God game just add anti cheat and perfect game for now its 8/10
6543	1	a	Everyone has to try this game and experience what F2P GTA is like
6545	1	a	this game is awesone
6547	1	a	APB is very fun its kinda like Gta mixed cops and robbers and car chases but it as its limits once you rasie a mentor to level 10 and get the clothes you want your pretty much done with the game its really fun when you play with your friends it also has a free roam around city there are 2 diffrent cites and a social area for changing your clothes i think they could of made this game a little better and give it more free stuff to do in the city I rate this game out of 10 7/10
6549	1	a	this is very awesome game i want this game to live through ages and this game will live forever
6551	1	a	yoin mah clan... shadows of the nassebjÃ¶rns... its for only swedish people 
6553	1	a	It's a very good game. But it's (very) hard for newcomers. Some people say it's pay 2 win - nope it's definitely not P2W. People say that when they are losing and going mad about it (They're using excuses like 'This game is P2W' or 'You're Hacker' or they say that the weapons are unbalanced.) This game is fun, you must enjoy it and have fun while playing (with your friends or even alone) If you'll decide to play APB i recommend doing all tutorial tasks, trying every weapon you can and bringing some friends with you :D (use team speak 3)  Remember - Stay cool, never give up and don't go mad
6555	1	a	This game very good i play so much and someday it crash always crash and no one want help me i very very play this game when i playing and crash Dricx_invallcall i dont remember please anyone can help me   my PC core i5 2.50ghz ram 4GB and video card intel hd family 4000 (intel hd 4000) please help me fix this crash
6557	1	a	Its a pretty awesome game! It's a lot like GTA. Only issue is the steering on the cars... its hard to steer.
6559	1	a	This game is pure and insane fun. Imagine GTA. Multiply it several times. Total Chaos and Havoc everywhere. Two factions with clear focus on PvP action. Matchmaking is fluid and intuitive. Give it a shot, it's free.
6561	1	a	I recommend this game
6563	1	a	this game is amazing... I was looking for a GTA substitute and this fit the bill and more. I mean GTA you cant ram things and raid it! but this game includes a lot of customization which is awesome to express what you like in VG's. but in general a good game for anyone
6565	1	a	+ It's a nice game with decent graphics, and multiplayer. + Alot of nice vehicles, some new would be nice though. + The customization is out of this world, i have never seen a better one + Driving is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. + The game contains some nice tunes in it, that you can access anytime with P. + It's free for play, and not pay to play. + Premium is a nice touch, only that it's pricy, would love some more free premium days! - The matchmaking system is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you end up with gold threat even though you are silver, and if you are gold you end up with noobs. - You usually end up with stupid teammates, and ofcourse they have the worst gun and can't aim. - Griefers with trucks, they ram, slam and kabam you into buildings making you explode &gt;:(. - People speaking other languages in chat even though it's EN server. - Waterfront seems a bit grey, try adding more colour to it. - The 'Whisper' is to OVERPOWERED and should be taken off the game.  i give it a 6/10 :)
6567	1	a	Great game if you can put up with the lag and occasional bull poop moment... has improved slightly over the years but they wont fix the servers for some reason...
6569	1	a	this game is awsome
6571	1	a	Ebola Game :) been playing it for about 3 to 4 years...
6573	1	a	Customization is amazing.  Yes, the game is difficult. (learning curve 3steep)  No, there's no p2w.
6575	1	a	Its very fun and its worth the while
6577	1	a	I greatly engoy this game. heck, its my favorite game. the animations are a bit rough but if i had to choose i would pick apb reloaded. good job creators.
6579	1	a	good game only issue is its pay to win
6581	1	a	Overall a good experience when you are high level in the game and you are playing with 3 friends using VOIP, But now ever since the game switched to Steam, Its been riddled with hackers.  The game is about tactics, But new players don't see that part, They just run and shoot like CoD players.  The game is highly customisable, And has a wide variety of clothes and character attributes. You can be any character you'd like, Just re-create it, Takes some time, But its nice.  If you'd like to give it a try, I recommend it, Its free after all, But don't play alone.
6583	1	a	This is an really awesome game played over 250 hours with my main account !
6585	1	a	its hard but thats what hard core gamers like, like me
6587	1	a	This is a game of shooting, driving and sometimes getting angry.  It has a learning curve and sometimes will put you up against tough opposition which feels noticable but if you've played BF2 or similar multiplayer you'll spend the same amount of time getting killed before you get used to it.  The community is made of 'u mad bro' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ rejects and as such its best played with a few mates.  Customisation is massive and worth playing with. Spary your car. Dress and alter yourself and your clothes. You can also compose tunes to play when people die.  Worth trying, but worth knowing that it takes some time to get in to it.
6589	1	a	Just don't be a crooked cop.
6591	1	a	YOU BUY G.I. 11/-1  A caring message from the Vietcong Recruiting Office.
6593	1	a	I Think Is A Bit Like GTA That Is Free To Play! But Remember That If Its Free To Play It Want Be That Good But I Still Have A Lot Fun Playing it Specialy With Someone :D Its Cool Get It If U Don't Belive ME!!!!
6595	1	a	wher do you find the grage 
6597	1	a	i would recomend it for fast computers but not for slow ones or you will have a verycrappy time
6599	1	a	Fun,but only if you don't take it to seriously, as I can see one of my friends did -_-.
6601	1	a	This game is very great i love it.
6603	1	a	Great game i would recommend to anyone
6605	1	a	I found it to be very fun and enjoyable, the game dose not offer as much (if any) realism as other shoters, howerver its the content and the great custimazability that makes this game so great and highly adicting. If you want to try a new type of shooter with great possibilitys than try apb and find yourself glued to the screen!!!!
6607	1	a	I liked APB.. but didn't continue after a couple of plays.. simply becuase it lacked controller support. There were a few features I would have liked to have seen also.. radio stations, more solid single quest modes and not just MP, because if your just starting, single quests is where you learn your tools to play the mp. a more detailed customisation of char. but I havent played in around 2 years so maybe they have these features now.. if your Kb&amp;M and stuck for cash, it's F2P.. worth a tryout, if you don't like then no harm done.
6609	1	a	Go ahead punk, make my d- OH GOD HE'S PAYING TO WIN, HELP!
6611	1	a	APB is what GTA should of been. Best of all, it's completely free.
6613	1	a	Ambitious, that's for sure, with plenty of insane customizability, but overly-high system requirements and unsatisfying gunplay will undoubtedly see this game die. Again.
6615	1	a	GTA online FTW !!!
6617	1	a	Cant wait to try it out but it keeps saying i did the download wrong
6619	1	a	I love this game a lot.A real police game. I would like to have good Grapical. I really exicited to play this game. I canÂ´t wait anymore.I love police games.And in this game you can play youÂ´re real life that is fantastic. Fantastic
6621	1	a	Very fun, very exciting and it makes me hard! This game has so much to it, there is almost never something to not do, but warned little wallets, they vant ur moneyz I do not recommend purchasing ANYTHING for this game, it's a free game, it's fun to keep it that way
6623	1	a	Excellent FTP game that is fun to play with friends or just when bored. Downside is the lag that you may sometimes experience from this games heavy usage. Other than that this game is truelly amazing for being free.
6625	1	a	cool Free Action game i Love it
6627	1	a	Fast cars, Sweet guns, and money (that isn't yours) sounds amazing, but when you play the game, you get to live it.
6629	1	a	This is not a 'pay2win' game. I have played for several months now and it is laggy but I am using a computer that was born 2009. My friend plays on a recent build and gets no lag at all.   Pros: Challenging Customization is great Upload your music too Make music for themes or songs Fairfight banning hackers(woohoo)  Cons: Not enjoyable on older computers(laggy)  This is an awesome game to get into but if you love winning every time then maybe it is not for you. You still level up, earn money, and unlock items even when you lose. So, give it try. If you don't like it you can always uninstall.  Update due to other reviews I have seen: You can always play while events are going on and get prizes (like premium) and use them to create whatever you want (tattoos, car decals, and such). It will still be there when the premuim expires. :)
6631	1	a	A good GTA like game that has a lot of customizations but it is multiplayer. A lot of missions and contacts that are fun to play with. But there are many hackers in the game which sucks. But it is really an awesome game after all. I will recommend this game to open-world gaming fans. :)
6633	1	a	Amazing game when playing with friends!
6635	1	a	Fun game. Reminds me of GTA. It is one of my favorite Free-to-Play's on steam.
6637	1	a	This Game is MAJOR Pay-2-Win, the Anti-Cheat System Sucks and there is some Input Lag as well.  But if you can get past all that then the Game is somewhat Fun and Enjoyable with Friends. Just my Personal Opinion Though.   Final Rating 5.8/10
6639	1	a	Its cool
6641	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Awesome ( All I Have To Say)
6643	1	a	its ok
6645	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APB's new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010's deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results.  The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first game's devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one.  Reloaded's missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars.  These do happen more regularly than before â€“ little adrenaline shocks to punctuate hours spent bumbling around between jobs. More often, playing Reloaded's missions is like beating your head against one of San Paro's flat, grey concrete walls.  Mission locations are invariably overlooked by high ground. The first team to occupy that ground is the de facto winner, possessing sufficient cover to pop anyone who comes close. Grenades can't flush them out. Well-versed players will simply set up camp in an unassailable location and sit out ten minutes of screaming frustration. San Paro is so full of hiding spots and high ground that it's far easier to put someone else's mission under lockdown than it is to complete your own.  Urban renewal doesn't seem to have been high on GamersFirst's list of priorities: APB had the same spatial problems, and the same tiresome missions. The new devs have instead focused on the economy. Reloaded is free to play, supported by item, modification and vehicle sales, as well as a premium semi-subscription option. Steer clear of the latter and you get obnoxious little reminders telling you what you could've won in XP and in-game currency if you'd stumped up the cash.
6647	1	a	ruined my life :D liek if yuo kry evrey tiem!
6649	1	a	oh hi  nice game   i have 60R in this game :D
6651	1	a	The coolest free to play game of all times, iv'e really got addictet to it. come and play with me.
6653	1	a	Doesnt Support dual screens, so i had to disable a screen to play it, throws you into a game with no information on what you have to do or when or how. all the quests are as followed, go to point Hold the F key. Pick up thing with the F key drive back to start point. get reward. Driving is terrible cars handle like they are on ice every mechanic in the game is clunky and un refined to the point of it being unusable. Quests that use PVP are simply defend point or capture point while killing people that respawn over and over for 10 minutes. when u die ull respawn about a half minute walk away from the action. youll die in 2 hits, they will die in about 2 Clips. no exceptions. camera sways from side to side like your drunk in gta4 with roman. everything about this game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. a person i know just said that you have to get used to it, but id rather not lower my standerds of play. The only people that play this are the sad people that cant justify paying for it before it was f2p
6655	1	a	this game is awesome i love that you can have more then one charachter
6657	1	a	Rated A for AWESOME
6659	1	a	The game just wont work. I downloaded this for gamerfirst then steam....none work. Please tell me how to fix this.
6661	1	a	Yea i REALLY like this great game
6663	1	a	really awesome
6665	1	a	0/10 did not even download the game
6667	1	a	Fix your game, i am stuck on the character menu.
6669	1	a	game said i had corrupt files. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ didnt even work. still looks fun
6671	1	a	10/10 would uninstall again
6673	1	a	JUST THUG LIFE!
6675	1	a	Has lots of problems, mostly created by G1. Fun though. Lots of potential.
6677	1	a	This game is fantastic. However it is hard for new players to get into it because of the amout of pay to win players. That does not mean quit. Just stay in a green or bronze District and get better. Pay to win players can be beat. You just have to have a large arrangement of weapons because pay to win probably only have a few guns that they use so if you find one that overpowers it then you can beat them easy. Every pay to win gun has a normal gun that can dominate it. Other than that slight problem the game is basically GTA just alot better and free.
6679	1	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Sprayed nazi propaganda on a massive wall.   Go download this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing thing
6681	1	a	THIS GAME IS GANGSTER
6683	1	a	
6685	1	a	6/10 Good Graphics *10/10 Customization -Weapons, Outfits, CARS 5/10 PvP -Takes getting use to  
6687	1	a	super cool game, awesome gameplay and style. there is a awesome comunnity if you arent good at the game cause if you rek people you hack. but there is a good antihack system in this game so hackers are rare. i can totaly recomand this game, find a clan with teamspeak and you can spend years on this game.
6689	1	a	I actually really like this game Pro: smooth gameplay(from asus computer) Con: REALLY LONG update time (on old computers)
6691	1	a	Great game, ruined by hackers. Fairfight only gets a few. =\ I still think it's a great game for other features.
6693	1	a	Yea, this game, its addictive, yep. You start, then you don't finish. This. Game. Is. Addictive. So if you want to have a life, have friends, and not think crazy thoughts, don't play this game. Yea. Yes.
6695	1	a	This game is like chewing gum, you eat it, spit it out and never eat it again. ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)  10/10
6697	1	a	Instead of 'Gamersfirst' it should be renamed to 'Wallets First'  8/10
6699	1	a	Massive customization options overall, even if you don't have the prem account, you stil can do a lot of fun making your own character if you have imagination, of course. Good shoot arenas, pace gameplay, tons of fun shooting others up. Not perfect, but it's free and really playable .. reccomend this for a choise over buying a GTA series, still not so good as those, but surelly worth a try..
6701	1	a	Fun Fun..... not a lot for me to do like drive around since my Fps skills suck but its a fun game.
6703	1	a	great game thou i dont like the player vehicle system where you can only drive ai cars, your car, or people in the same mission you are but other than that really fun open world mmo
6705	1	a	Love it, I hate it, but thats why this game is so much fun, you can be losing and the next moment TABLES ARE TURNED, GUN FIRE ALL OVER THE PLACE TEAMMATES BLOWING EACH OTHER UP AND YOUR SUDDENLY WINNING. WATCHOUT ITS A GARBAGE TRUCK READY TO GREIF YOU BADLY...   got carried away there for a moment, but thats how this game makes me feel. its too fun and addicting.  I give thumbs up cause I've been playing for a long while now :) and once you get far in ranking its really enjoyable  Pros: you can meet some pretty interesting people on here and teamwork is vital which is the success to this games team vs team  cons: needs to get rid of the bots and ghosters, and G1 needs to be more truthful and up to date with there releases... still waiting on the engine update.. :( otherwise this is my first longest review, hope you all enjoyed my input...
6707	1	a	Great game can be Paid to win, but you dont really need to pay it just makes it less of a hassle. If there are no people on the server it goes to crap because your stuck running around collecting things or having to play vs a very high ranked player and he just camps you over and over. Mic is required or fast typing skills lots of communication. Servers are dead lately so might want to check it out before you spend any money.
6709	1	a	i wanted to play this but it was rather glitchy and laggy and i couldnt auctually play it at all and i am sad about that. 
6711	1	a	Grills, kills and glitches. +300 rep for grills -100 rep for glitches 9/11 points
6713	1	a	;)
6715	1	a	I'm Commisioner Gordon by day, and the Black Mask by night.  7/10  Would cruise in Police Car to 'In the Air toinght' By Phil Collins again.  Would not get kicked off team before xp gain for 3rd time though.
6717	1	a	cool
6719	1	a	I would not recommend this game to anyone... Why can't I stop playing it? Somebody help me. (Play this game with me)
6721	1	a	Good game, but requires a VERY good computer to run. I found this out the hard way, as it crashed about every 30 mins.
6723	1	a	One word, ruthless. APB can be spectacular and awesome one moment, and frustrating as hell the next, amazing levels of customization in a game thats just like GTA, if you can get over the occasional hacker and the childish members of the community you are in for a treat, if not then dont play APB, go pet some kittens instead :p
6725	1	a	The design is far from mature and beautiful. Play it unless you love to shooting with massive other players or you enjoy drive cars in a sandbox.
6727	1	a	i want to play this but it wont function even though i meat the minimal requirements
6729	1	a	Very Addicting funny game. Nice for playing with friends. I recomend it to everyone (of coure above 18). 
6731	1	a	Really well thought out game - a bit pricey if you're looking for items on the marketplace; but understandable due to how the game itself is free and doesn't require you to buy anything for it in order to play without any hassle - ignoring the people who complain about it being a Pay2Win scenario. Buying marketplace items is just for vanity mostly. :)
6733	1	a	Really recommended game it has everything
6735	1	a	It's basically a poor man's GTA Online. The character creator is suprisingly in-depth for some reason. I can't speak for whether it's pay-to-win or not as I never actually bothered looking at the cash shop.
6737	1	a	Love It
6739	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME   ESPECIALLY IF U R IN A CLAN  +REP
6741	1	a	Cop stealling innocent's car and in legal Criminals stealling innocent's car and illegal  Cop and Criminals can shoot each other every time they want. and no one stop them   Seriously?! Cop Can do everything they want    Overall  Graphics - 8.5/10 Gameplay - 6.5/10 Servers - 9.5/10  Overall 7.5/10 -Not Bad
6743	1	a	personally my on of my favorites
6745	1	a	Rated A for A-holes.
6747	1	a	To be honest I do really like the game but it is more of a pay to win game since you need to buy weapons with real money to actually own them forever, other than that it's great.
6749	1	a	It's a very good game. I just hope they keep adding new updates to it with more variety of clothes.
6751	1	a	  Its good
6753	1	a	it soo much better now than it was. would also be beter for m if i was a good shot.
6755	1	a	Easily a great game with amazing customization aspects and gameplay, but unfortunately falls short due to a mediocre matchmaking system. If you're persistent enough to push through the bad parts of the game and play with friends, there is a huge potential for lots of fun to have.
6757	1	a	APB Reloaded is the best F2P game but cheater destroy the fair play in critical fights. The cheater can activate and deactivate the cheats in seconds. They switch very fast their 'god mode' because they donÂ´t want to be detected and banned.  The game is a third-person shooter with RPG-like character settings.  At the beginning you have to choose one side - enforcer or criminal, which you canÂ´t change easily. The huge variation of weapons you have are impressive and make fights really tactical and hard. Teamplay is really important in APB but lots of players fight solo - including me.  IÂ´ve learned to fight alone against groups but that was two years ago - Meanwhile, I have forgotten it because the cheaters made me angry and i decide to stop playing APB.  I hope that the developers from APB had a solution to detect cheater, why i started a week ago to play APB.  LetÂ´s hope iÂ´ve made the right choice !  If the cheater problem is solved i can recommend hundred percent APB !!!
6759	1	a	played for 10 minutes.  10 minutes trying to get the game to launch 0 playing  10/10 launcher simulator
6761	1	a	My rating : 6/10  This game is a bit similar to GTA or Mafia 2 with okay performance.
6763	1	a	My review for APB Reloaded: Pros: Great game,I play it everytime and now im used to it. Massively Multiplayer which I like. Even though I dont like third person shooters,I still love it's gun physics. The game is stable which makes my computer totally crash. Has alot of things to do which I also like personnaly since there will be alot of playing and lots of fun too.  Cons: This game has HORRIBLE matchmaking. Game has too many bugs and glitches (espacially the wardrobe one.) Has too many hackers and Gamersfirst isnt doing anything about it. Game is p2w which I spent 50$ on just a rly bad gun. Chat has too many bad stuff and annoying people which I hate.  My rating: 8/10.Great job Gamersfirst.
6765	1	a	A fun free to play GTA-styled game with lots of customization. Worth trying! Recommended! :)
6767	1	a	Been playing this for a few weeks now, enjoying the GTA like game in a mmo style, try it :)
6769	1	a	If they remove all the hackers would make the game so much better, but if they did that it would be such a fun gmae
6771	1	a	don't know why so much people whine about unfair MM, learn to aim its not harder then that, i have played 65 hours and still stomping people who is lvl 255, can do it with the first weapon to, they just don' realise how to aim and learn it.. it takes like 10 hours to understand the recoil in the game..
6773	1	a	It's pretty good as long as you don't play it too much
6775	1	a	This Is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING Good game
6777	1	a	RON IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6779	1	a	Have not played in awhile, waiting on new engine. However, GREAT GAME!
6781	1	a	i drove a car once or twice
6783	1	a	I played in the Original BETA with RealTime Worlds. This version KICKS MORE ASSSS!!! Play it. Come onto Server: Patriots EU2
6785	1	a	this game is really fun and just a great game 
6787	1	a	10/10 Would run around in social district again.
6789	1	a	The game does have it's flaws but overall it is one of those games where you can troll other people and have a decent time with friends. Like to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ people off? Well this is the game for you but warning! Other players are just as good at trolling, even better at times. So eat tacos and let the bodies hit the floor.
6791	1	a	Its perfect if you like wallet warriors who spend their hard earned money on over priced items!
6793	1	a	its a great game alotlike gta with saints row
6795	1	a	Tons of fun for a F2P game, the more friends you play with the better. Only drawbacks are the slightly awkward UI for shops and the time limit on weapons and Vehicles which you purchase but that is a downfall of the sales model.
6797	1	a	Played with a buddy of mine for about an hour or so, it was very fun flanking camper VIPs and killing them one by one until the game asked us to go after people carrying drugs and we got seperated. Didn't see or notice any hackers, but almost everyone was playing together with their friends so not suggesting playing this alone. It's a free game, don't have high expectations but it's good enough to waste a few hours now and then with your friends.  Here's a gameplay video for you;          YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Being Bad at: APB Reloaded | This is our trash! | BurasÄ± bizim Ã§Ã¶plÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼mÃ¼z!&nbsp;
6799	1	a	My thing wont update so i cant play!?
6801	1	a	It's pretty much the biggest Pay to Win game out there. Is it fun? With friends, Hell yeah!
6803	1	a	  i like the game but honestly the community sucks as i free player its not possible to get past silver since all gold players are premium and have paid perks and weapons. but as a silver player or below you can have a good time with the game
6805	1	a	Its free and its amazing! Download it!! 
6807	1	a	Great game.... Alot of bugs and it's poorly optimized, we've been promised an engine upgrade for years now... still waiting  But the idea and concept of the game is the best i've ever seen.. (Y)
6809	1	a	Cool game for going all out against hordes of cops/criminals. Also, very good customization options, I recommend. 
6811	1	a	Well, the balance system is a do-it-even-exist but it has the most advanced character custumization system ive seen and the environment in missions is awesome so its worth testing
6813	1	a	nice game you can keep playing it you don't get bored
6815	1	a	Let me start off with the word: 'wow...'  This game has stolen so much out of my time. But in the good way of course!  I have played APB: R for a COUNTLESS amount of hours. I met tons of nice people, that I eventually have become really good friends with outside the game.   The game has TONS of customization and replay value. The missions start getting repetitive, but the players and the gameplay of the different players make it so much different every time. I love it!  The game runs smoothly, but you do need a bit of a strong PC to play it. If you have problems over steam, I would suggest you to download the standalone from Gamersfirst themselves and add  APB Advanced Launcer  [forums.gamersfirst.com]  to it. It allows you with tons of more customization for your graphical settings than the game can give you. Props to the guy who made it!  Rounding up, 9/10. The game has its flaws, but I love the game with them. It wouldn't be the same fun without them! Cheers Gamersfirst for picking up a dead game and making it free to play! (the game died after a subscription model, but got brought up again)
6817	1	a	armas marketplace
6819	1	a	I miss this game, gonna have to start playing again!
6821	1	a	Get ready to get rustled.
6823	1	a	this is good game
6825	1	a	Man, what can I say? I'm basically playing my character from San Andreas, busted out of Federal Prison after 10 years!   Different city, sure. But the street feel is familiar. High nostalgia hit for the violent 300lb homie covered in badly spelled jail tattoos. MO Cops and Robbers. Ultraviolent roadrage incidents. Taggin' grafitti spots. Rollin' in a group. Customizing clothes to wear or sell. Kitting out mods to make life bearable against live opponents. 4 levels of Threat: Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold...Open Bounties on Prestige 5 Enforcers and Notorious Criminals. Decent variety of vehicles and weapons to unlock.  Cons:- not real minuses, but worth noting. Playing from Australia on Han server, expect noticable lag if map population is over 40. Still playable with up to 60 on a map, but you better let someone closer to the server drive. Much past that and it's not great. There will be undrawn walls to collide with, stuttered audio and ghosting. But you can always hit the Marina Social District and work on designs, or swap map instances to a less populated map. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics can be difficult to use. Important to pick the closest server. Match making can feel a bit off at times.  Pros: Multiple instanced maps. 3 mission districs with average threat level displayed, and open conflic maps where the matchmaking is turned off, plus Fight Club. But I won't talk about Fight Club. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics are easy to learn. Same as basic movement substituting handbrake for jump. If you're a GTA fan who just wants to play Cops and Robbers with some open-world interactions and a story if you want it, this could well be the game for you. If matchmaking is off, or teams are unbalanced, you can call for backup.  Fairfight Anti Hacking seems to work, not much problem with hackers these days. The ban announcements pop up in the chat window for everyone to see. Doesn't appear to be Pay-to-Win, they claim tactics can win over load-out. I've seen that, too. Gold players will hand you your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unless you're an exceptional lower Threat player, in which case you'll go up in rating faster.   This is an &lt;R&gt; rated game. Not for kids. Thought I should mention that. Bombings, Arson, Carjackings, Muggings, Ram-Raids, money laudering, automatic weapons and bad language. It's rated &lt;R&gt; for a m___________g reason, yeah?   Welcome to San Paro.
6827	1	a	Too Costly The Dlc's !!!!
6829	1	a	Its pretty good once you know how to get costum stuff very unique engines of creating stuff, You get very confused for a bit at the start but it gets really good! kinda reminds me about GTA
6831	1	a	This game is oodles of fun. But don't let that mask the greediness of the people of Gamers First. Yes this game does intail all that it says. But you have to 'pay' for more then half of them. Customization, Permement and Exclusive Guns, Cash and Progression (Exp) bonuses, Car Parts, Symbol creation, and I'm sure there is lots more you will find.   Premium (Which entails Bonus Cash and EXP, Symbol/Car Customisation and... I think that's it.) costs 799 G1 credits which ammounts to 10$ US total. But that I beleive is the beta price. Because the image has a 1199 (15$ US) crossed out in the back which makes the current price a special and assuming it doesn't last until it's fully released.  Permament/Premium guns. Guns can range in price from 17$ all the way up to 60$. 60 Dollars! I cannot fathom who decided to begin the price range like that, but for G1 to agree on it takes the cake. These guns are character bound. So if you want a gun on your Criminal and Enforcer then your lookin at 120
6833	1	a	Best copV.sRobber game ever
6835	1	a	cool game austin should get it
6837	1	a	Very Good Game. Kindam pay to win, but still you ca have lots of fun when you are skilled to use the starter weapon.a
6839	1	a	This game. Still one of my top 5 fave games, even after playing it for a long time. Skills and reaction time is all you need to win in this game (and maybe internet with good connection). No matter if ur playing against people with premium weapons or not, the stock assault rifle is enough to handle anything. Maybe except for OSMAWs and OPGLs. Customization is also the most thorough one i have ever found in games, MMO or non-MMO. check out my screenshots and see for yourself what level of customization level im talking about. enough of me talking, Play The Game. May seem a bit complex at the beginning, but once you got the hang of it, its really simple and fun. WARNING. HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.
6841	1	a	Worth playing, me and my friends Mike and Tristan play this all the time, a fun multiplayer shooter
6843	1	a	A game of 'cops and robbers.' While the robber's have it easy, they can earn money by robbing, and cop 'must' earn money by 'taking' a robber's 'stolen' money and by missions. The game can provide entertianment, but does tend to get 'old' after a while.  -dark  *This is my review but the best way to find out if you like it is to play it.
6845	1	a	  its a good game but we need a motorbike and a bus and a plane and a tank and a aircarft
6847	1	a	Best free game ever made download asap!
6849	1	a	good game good game i dont even like this game 10/10 I would install and uninstall this game!
6851	1	a	After a few hours it will be boring
6853	1	a	Its fun. You shouldn't expect very good graphics nor very good car control. The mission system is fun though its not perfect - still some things to improve. Also this finally gets its engine update. But well.  Been playing this for 800+ hours and over a long time period. Paused once but then came back. Also spent lots of money in it. Shortly before the engine update it finally happens, I get banned for some reason, haven't been told a reason why when contacting the support either. Sorry but that is bull_sh.it. If I get banned for whatever reason, it should be my right to at least know what I have done wrong. Besides that, the game is fine and fun and eats your time. But you shouldn't expect a graphical marvel.
6855	1	a	I've had a case of hemeroids that was more fun than this game.
6857	1	a	I cannot believe this game is still around...so many bugs and cheaters.
6859	1	a	totally tubular 
6861	1	a	Nice game :)   Very deep customization, make your own unique Character, Clothes, Cars, logos, music themes etc.   You can buy permanent guns and clothing items in the Real money store, but all the guns in the store can be obtained free aswell from contacts just not permanent (7 days etc for ingame currency).  One of the best F2P games yet imo, but if youre thinking of starting to play now i would hold off until the upcoming Engine change.
6863	1	a	3/5 - Great game, ruined by hackers.
6865	1	a	love this game
6867	1	a	This is one of the most broken, poorly coded, bloated, neglected, newbie-unfriendly MMOs I have ever played, yet I can't seem to pull myself away. It's a mess that somehow still manages to provide hours and hours of ridiculous fun. I consistently neglect the mounting hoard of games in my library to play this game. I therefore do recommend it, although I would caution anyone that wants to get started that the game has a rather steep learning curve. The matchmaking is very hit and miss, which means you will likely get curbstomped for a long time before your feet find the bottom of the pool.  The plusses for this game are its impressive array of customizable options, and the intensity of its firefights, which can, at its best, feel relentless and fast-paced. The negatives are its bloated memory requirements, server lag, the toxicity of the player-base, the repetitiveness of missions. and the lack of administrative support.  In the end, however, if MMO GTA is what you're looking for... well, this isn't exactly up to that, but it's the closest you'll get, and for me, that was worth the time.
6869	1	a	 Gameplay
6871	1	a	Good ol' APB, I have over 2000+ hours on my other acc where I used to play. However now I moved on over to a second acc due to my main char being removed. Anyway--  ----- Pros: -----  + Customization is GREAT within this game, you can customize anything from your clothes to how your car looks to how your character looks.   + Can get most things in-game for free, there are some weapons on Armas that are a bit too 'OP', that'll get fixed eventually but there are ways to counter weapons that are 'OP' anyway, it's all about teamplay and tactics.  + Not that many hackers around, atleast not for long. (Might take a few days for someone to get banned) It's mostly experienced players, who've been playing the game for a long time and for that reason alone they're being accused of hacking by a majority of players.  ------ Cons:  ------  - Nowhere near as many admins/GM's in-game as there should be, there's lots of things going on in chat that shouldn't. So don't take it to heart if anyone is trying to offend you.   - Some OP Weapons in Armas, as I said they'll probably be fixed in the future ''  - Poor optimization, you'll need a pretty good rig to be able to play this game with decent framerate unless you're willing to alter some text files or download Adv.APB Launcher that'll do just that.  - Takes a few days for hackers to actually get banned, FairFight doesn't work that fast, and sometimes it can ban an innocent player. I have a few friends who've become a victim of this Perma Ban sentance.   ---  There's a bit more than that, but the game itself is FREE, so I'd give it a shot. The Tutorial isn't the best, and the community might be a bit hostile, but there are friendly players who are willing to help you out.
6873	1	a	I cant get in from this game 
6875	1	a	although my email doesn`t work for some reason the gameplay is pretty good
6877	1	a	It was a great game untill I went over to a Mac. Could the developers, if it's possible, try to make it available for Mac users also? This was by far one of my favorite games to play and I'm wishing to play this game again on my stronger computer.
6879	1	a	it is a fun third person but one problem it crash A LOT i can barly play it but it is the first week on steam so....
6881	1	a	I would say it is a pretty solid game, it's just that the Pay to Win is a bit too obvious but with the majority being f2p I think it is not a big problem.
6883	1	a	I got this game before i had steam so i have about 1000+ hours. This game is somewhat pay to win but then again you can reach almost everything without paying. The physics engine might not be the greatest but boy you can have a lot of fun with it. 10/10 would stunt again.
6885	1	a	Love it man just need a good net and a pc but i love this game since gta 5 hasnt released for pc its like a replacement :D
6887	1	a	5/5 would flip my 4x4 vegas again
6889	1	a	  -Really fun gameplay -Graphics are okay -2 Teams -Open World Multiplayer!
6891	1	a	Ain't much worser than GTA online. 3/5
6893	1	a	I haven't played this game enough to rate it. But i can tell that the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, and weapons in this game are making it awesome! The only bad thing about this game is the community, 50% are hacking russian â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But i enjoyed myself. 9/10
6895	1	a	Loading simulator 2015   10/10 would wait again
6897	1	a	A non stop Cops n' Robbers game were you can be flanked by any location,customize you car,your character,your clothes and even make your own music!
6899	1	a	This game is badass to play in multiplayer
6901	1	a	great game not p2w guns for cash are jsut reskins...Legendary weapons are the only thing that is very Overpowered!
6903	1	a	great game
6905	1	a	love this game
6907	1	a	This is one of the most broken, poorly coded, bloated, neglected, newbie-unfriendly MMOs I have ever played, yet I can't seem to pull myself away.

6909	1	a	This game, although heavy with pay-to-win content, is extremely fun. I'd highly recommend it.
6911	1	a	Yes it totally Worth it For Free
6913	1	a	All time favorite game. Especially when my teamates are bronze new players, And the opposition is the highest ranked golds, and they have P2W weapons
6915	1	a	Very fun game. I personally enjoy it, just being a cop is a bit harder of a job. I don't like the long loading screens, but of course, that depends on your PC.  Over all, very fun and good. Definetly check it out!
6917	1	a	Very funny game with friends :) 
6919	1	a	Got an anger heart attack. 10/10
6921	1	a	this game is the best game of 2015 and will be for the rest of my life because it is all in one missions open world 3 person and i just think you who dont like it just dont comment   thank you abp  
6923	1	a	Love It
6925	1	a	DO...NOT...EVEN...TRY. 3.5/10! This game may be free, but I PROMISE you, that you will end up uninstalling it.  I played it for a few hours, before I realized how bad the servers are. Constant lag, coupled with a rare form of 'repetitive first-person-shooter' gameplay... I give this game a 3.5/10
6927	1	a	Been playing this for a few weeks now, enjoying the GTA like game in a mmo style, try it :)
6929	1	a	3/5 - Great game, ruined by hackers.
6931	1	a	don't know why so much people whine about unfair MM, learn to aim its not harder then that, i have played 65 hours and still stomping people who is lvl 255, can do it with the first weapon to, they just don' realise how to aim and learn it.. it takes like 10 hours to understand the recoil in the game..
6933	1	a	This game is good. Ive been playing it for 4 years... maybe more I dont know. Most peaople will tell you its about pay2win, but it realy isnt I know it. You just need high skill. You just need strong nerves and some time from start. So I recomend this game because its: open world, perfect customization of character and cars, not many hackers (only no-lifers with super skills) and I hope the upgraded engine for this game will make it better. Also APB is growing every week/month so it never gets bored. Thanks for reading my review.
6935	1	a	good game apart from the other powered players.
6937	1	a	See, I love this game. It's kinda like a GTA V without homes, and where you get to play on both sides of the law in a city that has abandoned hope.  It that doesnt sound cool idk what is. The matchmaking could be A LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT BETTER THOUGH. I only recommend because it's fun to play. I only put that in because tha matchmaking is utterly terrible.  Other than that, it's great imo. 
6939	1	a	Don't feel like getting Saints Row the Third or GTAV? You will feel right at home with this type of chaotic madness gameplay. The game is alot of fun running around doing missions that take teamwork. But this free to play does suffer game crashes for now until it gets fixed in the future. 8/10
6941	1	a	Trash.
6943	1	a	Noice game over all tbh
6945	1	a	Ive played since it was first made by Realtime Worlds and its come a long way and its one of the best games ive played. The hackers are no longer an issue ever since they implemented fair fight. Makes a huge differance in gameplay now. I would highly recommend this game now.
6947	1	a	Good sides: 1) Customization! You can make own death-themes (5 seconds) in a cool midi-editor, you can draw almost any symbol (and put it on any part of clothes, cars). 2) Community. Someone may say that it's all about cheaters, de-threaters or just morons (which always try to ruin your game), but you just should know that quite nice people still exist and you can make new friends just by playing good or making cool stuff (do you remember? - customization!!). 3) Not the worst physics.  Now why I wouldn't recommend this game: 1) Lags. Game really lags even on the newest top PC. Also servers have big tickrate (server-side fps). Sometimes it crashes. 2) Cheaters. Even when FairFight was introduced, cheaters are still a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥. But you always can change the district or simply 'do not care'. Or play with friends and make a cheater ragequit! 3) Engine upgrade will never happen (sadly, the game should had been updated 5 or 6 times before I wrote this review, but it has never happened...).
6949	1	a	I cant install net framework someone help me please ...
6951	1	a	You can still get money for them big ole heavy tvs' from the shop! I think the games time frame is first nokia phone thru right before flat screen tv.
6953	1	a	400hrs And My â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is Still Soft...
6955	1	a	Have not played this game in quite some time but when I did, it was good. Anyone care to explain what happened and how they ruined it?
6957	1	a	;)
6959	1	a	Very good game exited for the new engine!
6961	1	a	Good Game A Big Maps And I DOnt See Some Bug in The Game And Realy Good Try It Out And You See
6963	1	a	i have had a tons of fun hours and a ton of bad ones, but this game have super fun gameplay and amazing customization lvl both to your character and car. the down sides is minor compared to how fun it is playing.there is allot server issues, but every mmo have that form time to time. another bad thing is the community, (for me its a fun thing) all the fun hate whispers i have gotten over the years. sadly right now the devs is trying out some weapon mechanics that straight out destroying the game  and the devs takes months to fix obvious broken guns.
6965	1	a	So, the most beatiful thing about this game are loading screens, character creation, ads and pure concept. Whatever else is just roughly mediocre. Yep, it may entertain you for some time, but... just try it.  (PS: I played this game long before it was merged with steam)
6967	1	a	GTA ONLINO FOR LOW PC! NICE GAME THX
6969	1	a	Lets start this off by saying I have 1k+ hours in this game. This game is really not for everyone, its kind of clunky, buggy and irritating. But if you can look past that to the simple joys such as spending hours in a customizer making your character look like a true badass or pulling off amazing stunts in combat it makes it all seem worth it. A lot of this games problem is it rarely gets new players, this is because the vets who've played this game for thosands of hours drive off the newbies. People are toxic, they spew hate and slaughter newbies as a past time. It also has lots of problems with hackers as its a F2P. However it can be incredibly fun, and the people you meet are awesome. I won't say the game doesn't have problems, but if you can pass the trial by fire it opens up. We need new players badly the game can't really fix the problems it has unless we get new players. So its up to you the consumer to decide if you're tough enough to make it in san paro, you'll get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ beat but make sure you get some good hits in and keep at it and you'll make it.
6971	1	a	Well, i can say this is really good. The texture, maps, yeah it's all great. Although it doesn't run well on my Acer laptop :)
6973	1	a	I really don't have much to say since I didn't get pass the loading screen
6975	1	a	how do you get to play the game!? 
6977	1	a	This game feels really good and easy to run.
6979	1	a	A horrible example of grand theft auto. You do missions but it was all PVP. There was hardly any info on the game other than 'awesome' descriptions that don't match the actual game after 2 hours of play.  The community around the game was just as bad, nobody answering questions on the chat channels or even trying to group up. Leave it all to auto-queue and don't bother trying to make friends inside the game.
6981	1	a	all i want to say is two things i think this game needs that might have made me play it more than i have  -1 it need a way where people who dont want to pay can earn cars through missions or just have a way that we can have more possible features if we dont pay.  -2the map is small like really small  i might change my mind it depends f the game changes.
6983	1	a	The has its problems, but what game doesn't. Overall a fun experince
6985	1	a	its like GTA so its cool
6987	1	a	I love this game, years of playing it. 1300+ hours between Steam and In-Game. It's a little buggy and full of raging teenagers, but the shooting and fighting is great. I've spent hours just driving around and ramming things. If you want a F2P Third Person Shooter with a little bit of a learning curve, I'd recommend this one.
6989	1	a	I actually really like this game Pro: smooth gameplay(from asus computer) Con: REALLY LONG update time (on old computers)
6991	1	a	update: the game is dead. now they're just milking the remaining players as much as they can. still... APB for life.
6993	1	a	Ignore all these scrubs with 10,00000000000000000000 hours obviously the game is great if they been playing the game for that long i only have about 80+ hours but here is what i think, This game is great because there is so much stuff to do! imagine GTA except you decide if you want to help the city or gun it down. sure its a little buggy, graphics arent great but HEY the game is free what do expect? for those who havent played it yet give it a try i promise it will be a fun game and even better with friends! just come and play the game with low-medium expectations.
6995	1	a	Not enough â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6997	1	a	Great game!
6999	1	a	This game is like gta online but with factions! 
7001	1	a	A good game, whit good graphics. I can say it's hard if you don't use gamers material, in the same time it's a P2W, but still recommanded for the people who have skills :)
7003	1	a	This game has Loads to do! but also has a bland map but makes up with all the stuff you can do :)
7005	1	a	Awsome Game, but It is hard to get cars
7007	1	a	this game need ALOT, i mean alot of work on the lag and stutter issues which make this game almost unplayable at times, it is a good game but lag kills it.
7009	1	a	Great game!
7011	1	a	Fun game, until you realize you're going to get murdered every round unless you use ACTUAL MONEY to buy FAKE MONEY to buy FAKE GUNS that you only get for a limited time. unless you PAY MORE ACTUAL MONEY to realize that there isn't much more to do.  The outfit and car customization is cool, and there is some cool stuff you can do with it, but ,most things you get ideas to do, you can't. The customization menu for clothing has a limited amout of symbols you can place down, which can limit your creativity in some cases. Same thing goes for the car creator, with an even less amount of symbols you can place. If you have a lot of money to spare and are ok with it going to limited things, then you'll end up with a good looking character and car.  For the rest of you, good luck.  TL;DR: Fun game with customizable cars and outfits, until you realize it's a pay-to-win. Play for a while, don't get your hopes up for something extremely amazing.
7013	1	a	It's fun if you play with friends and want to get cancer sheerly based on the community.
7015	1	a	.
7017	1	a	High character customization. All player vs player.
7019	1	a	Good game, just is it just meor is the max quality 144fps?
7021	1	a	RON IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7023	1	a	I would say it is a pretty solid game, it's just that the Pay to Win is a bit too obvious but with the majority being f2p I think it is not a big problem.
7025	1	a	Pro: it's really fun if u like gun shooting and driving a cool car in one game. Great customization. Many detail for making character, car painting/designing, and music. Best primary guns are free, NSFA/OCA(short range guns), HVR(snipe gun), n-tech/sr15(mid range guns)  con: High computer system requirement. Some guns aren't free. Colby CSG(longer range shotgun), DMR-AV(snipe gun that can deal great damage to cars), Colby .45 AP(best mid range secondary), N-SSW(more stable LMG and w/o slowing too much movement speed). Bad matchmaking. (gold rank players are in silver or even bronze rank districts. Playing 2nd day can put u in a match against max level gold rank....) advance too easy(from bronze to silver and then to gold). Newbies&amp;noobs like me are still trying to figer this game out but we are advanced to silver or even gold. You could even advance if the match was lost. Climbing ladders can be distrupted by teammate. (When this happens too often to me, it makes me shoot my teammate) Latency got higher since server merge(US server)  conclusion:  if u care about winning much, u gotta be very good at the game and team up with other pros.  If u dont care about win/lose, its a fun game to play.
7027	1	a	Wanna have ultimate character customization in a game in which no one gives a got damn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about it? Here ya go.  
7029	1	a	all i do is steal cars and crash them into walls.. 10/10 would drive off bridge again
7031	1	a	Sucks a load of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
7033	1	a	This is a good multiplayer game to play with and meet new friends. Although the majority of the community is somewhat backward when it comes to social skills.   There are some problems with server performance and hits registering which still need to be fixed. The developers keep releasing P2W weapons that are basically re-skins of stock weapons. Joker boxes are, well, a joke: you just get trails for guns you already have... unless you spend hundreds of $ (which is exactly what they want).   Snipers ruin the game.   Cheaters are still a problem, although they have a new anti-cheat (PunkBuster was a joke).  Character customization is good; however, the designer isn't very well optimized or user friendly.   People make a fuss that this game is Pay to Win but I actually don't think it is. An experienced player can do just as much damage with the stock weapons (some of them broken).   I do, however, think that charging people to unlock car parts is pretty low (you have to buy car parts with real money).  Also, you have to be certain ranks to use mods like car surfer etc. which I think is silly since it gives high ranks an even bigger advantage.   Matchmaking is shocking - you have r22 vs. r255 - r255 silvers in a bronze district etc. Matchmaking should go on rank, not threat. This also creates a problem with idiots who decide to 'dethreding xD' [dethreating] in your mission by completely messing it up, so they can decrease their threat level.   Premium isn't implemented very well - it counts down even though you're not playing. I'd like to see premium depleat per playing time. As it stands, premium is a gimmick.   G1 credits are overpriced, and most of the content isn't worth it.   Overall, it's a good game if you're not playing with nubs - otherwise it can get annoying. Gameplay is also somewhat repetative (and they keep fixing bugs that make the game funny).
7035	1	a	this game need ALOT, i mean alot of work on the lag and stutter issues which make this game almost unplayable at times, it is a good game but lag kills it.
7037	1	a	It's fun if you play with friends and want to get cancer sheerly based on the community.
7039	1	a	Everytime there's an update, it is harder to get into the game ... HALP. XD
7041	1	a	Realy nice this game i love it :3
7043	1	a	This game is no doubt pay to win(and its really not cheap), however u can have lots of fun even without paid items. Most of the free guns sucks if you compare them to the paid ones, but you can still kill people with them quite easily.  PVP system in game is nicely done, its not boring at all, lots of action and blowing stuff up. Matchmaking is a little bit unbalanced, although it depends on what players are currently on server and what players are ready for a match. Sometimes it gets annoying if your enemies have paid 400k euro for guns without recoil.   Marketplace is one of the best things in this game, u can sell your 'artworks' to other players or buy stuff from other players, you can also buy there paid items for money you earn in game, but its really expensive (its obtainable, but it takes time)    The 'creation' systems is really well made, u can make basically everything in it (your logos, emotes, artworks), then put it at your clothing or on your kickass car. The customization in this game is just GLORIOUS. Characeter creator is really really good, you can make some serious stuff there, if you know what i mean xD  I strongly reccomend you to buy a premium, its worth it, you will be able to make more complicated paterns, clothing etc.
7045	1	a	TLDR: Great game, lots of customizations enjoy it  Let me start by saying, my steam hours do not reflect my acutal playtime, I played many more times before this came out on steam.  This game is great with it's ups and downs, as most free to play are but overall, it's a very good game.  Let's start with some of the bad things so you can end off on a good note. It's hard playing at the beginning because you can get vehicles stolen that you are using to make your money (vans usually), the combat might seem pay to win because you are up against high level or high threat players with much better when you are low level/low threat due to glitchy matchmaking however this can be avoided in premade teams and you can always win against better guns even though it might seem hard, using even the start gun on a new character I can take on quite a few people. There are quite a few glitches and bugs but most free to play games have these and you get used to it pretty fast.  There are quite a few good things I could say but the one thing that really sticks out in everyway is the customization. Customization. Customization. You can customize every aspect of this. Your character, car, weapon and everything else is completely customizeable. Don't like your character look? Head on down to the social district and buy items made by other players or make your own. Hell I ran into iron man playing 'I am Iron Man' and during any of the parts there weren't any lyrics he would scream 'I AM IRONMAN!' The community is great while at the same time very toxic depending on who it is. You can also customize your car. Pick your type of car, choose a color and make graphics or buy graphics to put onto your car and enjoy. One of my favorite points of customization for this game is how you can upload your own songs and play them while ingame in your car and people outside your car who have not downloaded the song onto their computer can hear your car. Customization is one of the biggest parts of this game which make it appealing but overall the game is fun to play in most ways where you can enjoy yourself and have fun.  TLDR: Great game, lots of customizations enjoy it
7047	1	a	This is one of my best games i have ever played this is the best 3rd person game i have played Best game ever 10%10! :D
7049	1	a	GTA with customization to boot.
7051	1	a	I still like this game has alot of going for it but its already been out soooo long and they could have fixed so much stuff by now but they just dont.... They really just need to listen to the MAJORITY of the players not the 200 random douches that cheat on this game or just pay to win
7053	1	a	I really wish this game was controller compatible.
7055	1	a	Amazing PvP and GTA like style with a lot of customization.
7057	1	a	it is a fun third person but one problem it crash A LOT i can barly play it but it is the first week on steam so....
7059	1	a	Cool game for going all out against hordes of cops/criminals. Also, very good customization options, I recommend. 
7061	1	a	If you combined the way preschooler's view cops and robbers with the worst cops and robbers action movie in the world, this is basically what you'd get. Somehow, the game is still enjoyable...mostly.  10/10 would be the best bikini cop again

7071	1	a	You can still get money for them big ole heavy tvs' from the shop! I think the games time frame is first nokia phone thru right before flat screen tv.

7081	1	a	Noice game over all tbh
7083	1	a	PLS MAKE IT FOR MAC I LOVE DAT GAME
7085	1	a	More or less like a free version of GTA Online.
7087	1	a	Very nice customization. That's essentially the main point and drive of the game. Takes some skill too. It's okay.
7089	1	a	MAX RANK IN ENOFRSER + MAX RANK IN CRIM I THINK THE GAME NEED MORE WORK
7091	1	a	Would waste 3000 hours again, 1/10.
7093	1	a	It takes a while to progress in the game and there is a large risk of skilled players (gold-rank wankstains) entering newbie-servers just to mess up your day. AND it's easier to buy the guns, cars and misc with real money than to play the game non-stop for days to get the new shotgun you've always seen those golden â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s wield and then only have it for like 3 days. The in-game currency takes a while to get alot of as well.  All in all, though, this is a creative person's DREAM game. You can customize cars, outfits, characters, themes and songs and utilize that ultimate strategic plan you've dreamed about for so long. If you ever wanted that intimate gaming experience with a small dev team and well-meaning regulars playing the game, this is it.  Even though the negative sides of the game may seem overwhelming, the devs and community are working hard to make new players feel welcomed in this game. I would seriously recommend this game if you have patience for it and if you are social person. Making friends with veteran players is a pro tip from a person with 493 hours plus in this game.  I hope this was useful for you if you've ever wanted to try a free GTA experience. DON'T let the mixed ratings of this game scare you away. Try it! If you've even considered playing this game for what it is, give it a try. It delivers ;-)
7095	1	a	Awesome and fun game and make you spend alot of time on it
7097	1	a	I guess it's not that bad.
7099	1	a	As you can see, i am an Argonian, And i require a certain... Type of game, And this game is perfect for me and my reptilian Brethren 10/10 Would Play Again
7101	1	a	Very fun game, sometimes the premiums and hackers can be asses, but all in all it's a recommendable game for friends to play ^^
7103	1	a	I love this game cuz ist very good and fun to play alone or with your friends
7105	1	a	Played it since its first beta before official launching, best costumization i have ever seen. Tons of fun with clanmates or friends.  will keep you busy for awhile.
7107	1	a	is amazing game but it is dieing this cant happen nooo i mean its like a smaller less known verson of gta online without all the trools AND MY SNIPER plz dont let this grate game die
7109	1	a	.WiN. I agreed your message......... This was my very favorite A.P.B. - Saints Row game, from then to now. Now, I stopped playing this game. Why, because of hack-cheaters &amp; traiting your team-mates, and extra is they not fixing this game system, just crap they put out. Ignoring us from them G.M. developers not caring about our feelings for a community we were in. -- Sighs -- This game will end to it's very own soul, and gone for goodness sakes when this go in a shut-down in the future, I hope..........
7111	1	a	First of all I'd like to clear up that G1 as developers are somewhat incompetent only seemingly wanting cash and money from players. So I will put a disclaimer that this review is leaning more into the aspects of the game or the game overall rather than the developers of the game and the decisions made by the company itself.  Now that I've invested quite the time with the game and as the time Im revising this review I have played for about 300+ hours of this game. I feel as if I was a bit too harsh and judgemental about my previous review of this game as I was critisizing the game way too harshly and was a bit biased due to my first experiences with the game.  Having invested a great amount of time into this game I have found that it wasnt as bad as I originally thought it was. The community is active in forums and are fun to socialize and interact with on most cases. Im not gonna lie that there are times when a player or two engages in the activity I like to call 'Who can be the best assh*le' in the game but they're only occasionally seen.  My best tip at this point would be to learn about the game in order to progress as APB Reloaded is a game that not only rewards you if you learn about secret routes or special hiding places for cover but also helps you progress through the game due to the help of the community itself.  I will admit though that before sinking 300+ hours into this game I painted a very biased opinion about the community making remarks that its cancer and toxic. Having personally interacted with the community in order to learn from veterans of the game and learning about tips and receiving advice from fellow players I then came to learn that it wasnt as bad as I originally thought it was.  Yes, the players online are very different from the ones in the forums and I can assure new players that it is not a turn off. The blend is quite well and sometimes even a good pair up. I will say though that if you dont have the patience to get better and invest some time into learning how things work with this game you'll end up having a very frustrating time blaming everyone else or everything else in the game rather than your lack of knowledge of it.  I whole heartedly feel that APB Reloaded is a game that I can recommend now, The graphics may be a little bit dated but that doesnt mean the game isnt enjoyable or playable. The community is helpful and fun to interact with and even though you get the occasional trolls you shouldnt get turned off by them since they are rare encounters. I would also like to state that there are barely any hackers in-game and I think people are mislead about the topic.  APB Reloaded is a moderately unforgiving game. Yes, I will say that it can seem unfair due to other players having upper hand due to the pay 2 win aspect but that has NEVER stopped me before. I have a character in Jericho server which had never seen any money invested to it and is now a Rank 100 Silver threat character with no premium and no overpowered guns at my disposal. The renting system is quite helpful since renting out guns that suit your playstyle can help you compete with various other players that does have premium guns and have invested money.   I also want to say that people think players are hacking but in all honesty those are the results of body modification implemented in the game. Just like in a MMO RPG, APB Reloaded has a system to benefit those who work on unlocking buffs for their characters. For instance there is a series of mods called Kevlar Implants and Clotting Agent. Both are health based modification used by many experienced players that give them an advantage over people. This isnt even part of the premium pay 2 win aspect as the body modifications I just mentioned are available to EVERYONE. Working up the ladder of whichever faction you chose to go with does reward you by unlocking these body modifications. Not only that but you can even get modification to give your guns more edge. BUT WAIT! it doesnt stop there! you can even put modification on your vehicles to suit how you drive and play! Of course you can customize your character but you can also implement skins on guns and even customize your vehicles!  Not only that but you never have to invest anything in the game as there is a system that lets you buy premium guns in exchange for in game currency earned through events such as Fight Club. This system is called the Joker Ticket system which lets players who dont have cash to invest in the game or just dont want to invest money to have an alternative way to get permanent items such as weapons, clothing, and even special vehicles and kits in a FREE way. Completeing objectives to save up Joker Tickets is a great alternative for those who want to play the game but not invest any money into it.  Take it from me who literally has a character that was built without the help of premium or OP guns. Just pure work put into the character and getting good in the game overall. As I said multiple times in this review, the key to APB Reloaded is to master the maps and to learn more about how things work in order to get better in the game.  Anwyays Ive been typing long enough so I will say this before I end this review. APB Reloaded is not a bad game at all. The learning curve is somewhat difficult and may take time to get used to. However, with the help of the community and fellow players you can get better at the game and advance. Try the game out and sink some time into learning how to play better and trust me it will be a great pass time if not a great game to enjoy overall.  Thanks For Reading!  -AgitoSempai (Jericho Server)  PS - Feel free to say hi :D
7113	1	a	play the best game apb and i might let you playy with me XD 
7115	1	a	Third person shooty shooty with vehicles in a big city, so imagine GTA Online but with random missions popping up.
7117	1	a	Driving and shooting game that supports terrorism and abduction.
7119	1	a	.
7121	1	a	this game need ALOT, i mean alot of work on the lag and stutter issues which make this game almost unplayable at times, it is a good game but lag kills it.
7123	1	a	is nice
7125	1	a	Cool game
7127	1	a	Fun game, until you realize you're going to get murdered every round unless you use ACTUAL MONEY to buy FAKE MONEY to buy FAKE GUNS that you only get for a limited time. unless you PAY MORE ACTUAL MONEY to realize that there isn't much more to do.  The outfit and car customization is cool, and there is some cool stuff you can do with it, but ,most things you get ideas to do, you can't. The customization menu for clothing has a limited amout of symbols you can place down, which can limit your creativity in some cases. Same thing goes for the car creator, with an even less amount of symbols you can place. If you have a lot of money to spare and are ok with it going to limited things, then you'll end up with a good looking character and car.  For the rest of you, good luck.  TL;DR: Fun game with customizable cars and outfits, until you realize it's a pay-to-win. Play for a while, don't get your hopes up for something extremely amazing.
7129	1	a	Masochism simulator
7131	1	a	I'm pretty sure this is some of the most fun I've had with friends in a video game ever. After 1400 hours on my criminal character, countless quittings and returns, and a mind blowing amount of 4â‚¬ spent, I believe I can finally give an honest review. I started playing back in 2011 and had an amazing new player experience, which included me and my four friends robbing stores to gather money for a personal van. The game was in a way worse state back then, but there was still plenty to enjoy. I don't play on a regular basis anymore, but the good memories still make me visit it every few weeks.  Now, I can see what people are whining about. Not much new free content has been released in the past year. But if you are a new player, there is still plenty to experience, ESPECIALLY with friends. And yes, there are still hackers and bugs, but it seems way better than 5 years ago. The servers seem to have improved significantly, atleast on EU. While the gunplay might not be impressive for most fps players and the driving mechanics aren't on a racing sim level, the character customization and the social aspect are unlike anything I've experienced before. Starting my own clan of around 40 people, sending them all stuff to design their outfits and cars, then rolling around the district trying to approach missions tactiacally... and end up team killing everyone anyway. But looking great while doing it.  It used to be way worse than it is, and it can still be a lot better. If you are like me and are willing to ignore some of the game's flaws and learn the basics, you can be in for a lot of fun. When or if the updated engine rolls out, I recommend every player, old and new alike, to check this game out. Hopefully after that, the devs will start pushing out more new content too, because it would be a shame if such a unique concept went to waste. 
7133	1	a	A lot of people overlooked this game in the beginning. It's free to play now, although you can spend a little cash to get some more customization. This is downright devilish in how fun it is to play together. Get it now! Lets play!
7135	1	a	Absolute garbage.  This game is the tale of pay to win tryhards vs. trolls who do not give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and with hundreds of customization options under your belt, trolling could never be easier. Nothing quite as satisfying as running over an anime pay2win roleplayer with your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ car plastered with the image of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the hood.  It's fun to an extent but don't expect depth unless you've got hundreds to spend.
7137	1	a	I would definately recommend this game to everyone but please apb PLEASE do major updates dont disapoint your community you have lost loads of fans by that
7139	1	a	PLS MAKE IT FOR MAC I LOVE DAT GAME
7141	1	a	alright cops and robbers game, dont expect much, not p2w though, star 556 is more than enough
7143	1	a	It didn't changed much in the last few years. I had a lot of fun playing this game 2 years ago :) I played it like 500 hours on both sides and it was the best F2P open world action game that I've ever played in my entire life. The best thing in All Point Bulletin is the possibility of custimazation. You can change your car painting, your kill music that your victims will hear after death, your character (almost like in the sims)  Right now it seems that APB is dying a little cause of only 2k people playing at the same time. I hope somedays they will renew that old masterpice for the new players :)  Otherwise I'm recommending this game to people who don't mind that there are just few servers.
7145	1	a	Overall a really nice game. Has a nice character customization. I would compare it to a Saints Row / GTA mix. Great to play with friends and is overall very fun.
7147	1	a	Amazing customization GTA like gameplay online anarchy i love this game!
7149	1	a	This game is pay2win
7151	1	a	Newbies need to join green districts to learn to play. Do not use the automatic join button on districts. You'll be paired with high level people if you do not follow those instructions.   Recommended if you're interested in thirdperson shooters that involve â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t lag sometimes. Engine update comes out soon. There is hope.   Premium codes are out there. The game is hella fun.
7153	1	a	It's an ok game I guess.
7155	1	a	Free and a worthwhile game for those that enjoy a good cops/robbers gta-esque experience.
7157	1	a	  The game has a lot of potencial, it's good idea, but poorly executed. It can be fun for a bit until you start realising all the flaws it has and it's huge pay2win aspect. The gameplay feels a bit clunky and lacking. The graphics are outdated (although they're getting an overall soon). It has a good amount of character customization, although I would love to see some more settings for it, and different styles of clothing. The vehicle handling model is bad, 'nuff said. The UI isn't always that intuitive and user-friendly, could use a cleanup. The game as a lot of bugs, sometimes to the point of being unable to play. The servers fail to deliver too many times to be justifiable, in terms of ping. A lot of the systems are poorly thought out, i.e. the threat system. The pay to win aspect is really the biggest deal-breaker.  'Basically, this game is cancer. I recommend this game, if you want to get ebola.'  On a more serious note, I do recommend this game, just download it, try out a few of the missions, the fightclub, try out the character customization (which is the best if you like social games), the vehicles, all that jazz.  Have some fun with it! It won't be the most amazing game experience, but it's pretty cool if you have nothing to do, and it can be pretty fun sometimes!
7159	1	a	I have no clue what I'm doing, but its OK.   I'm having fun while doing it.
7161	1	a	Cops and Robbers with cars you can paint, clothes you can buy, and very nice guns you can shoot. At F2P, give it a shot, and let me know when you're on.
7163	1	a	Is it me or is the stearing slow
7165	1	a	One of my favorite
7167	1	a	its ok i guess... 
7169	1	a	Cool
7171	1	a	Only punched me in the nuts twice, pretty okay experience.
7173	1	a	  this game much fun   
7175	1	a	Wont open, crashes whenever I try to play. rip.  Though what i've heard from my close friends, it's basically GTA for free, which is nice.
7177	1	a	Car Smashing Griefing Simulator whichever year. Of course there is more than that to this game. You buy clothes, you buy cars, you buy guns and feel fabulous about yourself, but all that comes with real world money or countless hours spent in this game. Is it worth your time you ask? Well if smashing low tier cars into high tier super cars until they explode until you get reported is your cup of tea, by all means create a bald naked fat guy and go ram everyone in the street. Also cherish the time introducing your friends to the game and finding them as disappointed about the community as you are.
7179	1	a	10/10 would pay to win again.
7181	1	a	I remember playing this game very often and having so much fun with it. It was the first of its kind that I had seen, and was just so addicting. Not exactly a P2W game, but all their paid items do get annoying. Another thing was the unforgettably bad community. Honestly, it's not the worst I've ever seen but it was still pretty bad. Lots of cheaters and hackers, too.   Other than that, the game can be very enjoyable. It becomes so much more fun once you find a friend to play with. The gameplay itself isn't the worst I've seen, and the customization is just awesome. Now that I think about it, you can basically customize every single aspect of your character (including vehicles) in great depth.  The game is fun but does have its flaws, but it's free, so what do you have to lose? Download the game, try it out, uninstall if you don't like it.
7183	1	a	if this p2w crap â™¥â™¥â™¥ game isn't enough, how about you join a real gang you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7185	1	a	You either like it or hate it... Try it for yourself and youll get what i mean
7187	1	a	Best free game ever made download asap!
7189	1	a	If you love making people angry  This is your game 
7191	1	a	Its nice and fun game to play with friends. But the support is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
7193	1	a	  Really good!
7195	1	a	this is a mix of gta. cod. and nfs. its amazing. the bad stuff about it is that it has bad graphics and {sometimes} poor matchmaking. also HAX EVERYWHERE THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT EM' IS RUNNING ehem...where was i? oh.   yeah.   the market place has some dank player made stuff.  BUT the apb official marketplace [the gc one] is just overpriced. all the REAL DANK stuff is p2w. i did it. [duh] well its not OP but it gives you a slight advantage.
7197	1	a	You're kidding me, only now then they add it on steam.
7199	1	a	i only played this because of criken
7201	1	a	I love this game, it is a very good game, and you don't have to pay real money to get anything if you're willing to just play the game. All of these people say it feels like a GTA clone, because it almost it! That's the point of it, the game is amazing, but expect it to take up a lot of your time, and be frustrating when somebody has a free trial gun.
7203	1	a	Well i gotta admit its a really good game with a really good story to it, ive played APB for a long time now and i gotta admit its a really good game with a really good story to it, who ever thinks it aint good screw all the haters
7205	1	a	I really don't have much to say since I didn't get pass the loading screen
7207	1	a	It's a great game but they need to improve on the guns and the missions for the cops but overall it's a great game
7209	1	a	This Game is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AWSOME! 
7211	1	a	This game is great! I love companies who make us wait 7 months for their promised engine updates! If you like waiting, this is DEFINITELY the game for you! GamersFirst promised an engine update by the end of Summer 2015, and now it's February 2016! I love it! I really hope they don't make us NOT wait! It's the best part of the game! GamersFirst really knows how to treat 'gamers first'! TL; DR BEST WAITING GAME OF ALL TIME!
7213	1	a	really fun but make less updates please,either then that got to say AWSOME game!
7215	1	a	
7217	1	a	A funny game, you can rage a lot on it but very pleasant, a lot of hackers but not every hackers are pretty cheat, some hackers are pretty bad and you can destroy them easily, some people will tell you that the game is a pay to win but it isn't a real one, if you don't want to pay, you aren't obligate, you can have everything for free but it takes a long time playing and if you're impatient, I hope that your credit card is full ^^
7219	1	a	this is a mix of gta. cod. and nfs. its amazing. the bad stuff about it is that it has bad graphics and {sometimes} poor matchmaking. also HAX EVERYWHERE THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT EM' IS RUNNING ehem...where was i? oh.   yeah.   the market place has some dank player made stuff.  BUT the apb official marketplace [the gc one] is just overpriced. all the REAL DANK stuff is p2w. i did it. [duh] well its not OP but it gives you a slight advantage.
7221	1	a	the game is good to play for a bit
7223	1	a	it is a pretty good game
7225	1	a	90% of the players are female in the game ofc
7227	1	a	Didnt even get to play. I downloaded a 4GB launcher, just to wait 20 minutes and never get to play. 10/10 IGN.                Serious note: This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
7229	1	a	I really loved this game, unfortunately my computer wasn't good enough to handle any of it's AWESOMENESS...so I had to uninstall it...*sadface*
7231	1	a	I love the customization in this game. however the lack of balancing and anti-cheat is insane (LMGs being better then sniper rfles)
7233	1	a	the game is okay i wish there was no hackers p2w players are not the problem now its hackers i still play it. fun with friends, nice cars, cool events, hackers thumbs down, if you can handle hackers i recommend.
7235	1	a	Entertaning shooting and driving game. Kind of a mmo GTA with lots of cosmetic configurations of the caracter, cars and clothing. The options are how ever mostly cosmetical.  Very hard to get a grip of att the start as there is a extream lack of instructions and information at the beginning. Free to play, but as with most F2P games its more like free to try. You really need to by the premium after a while to get the bonus exp and cach rewards, if you dont progression gets very slow and teadious.
7237	1	a	Very fun game, sometimes the premiums and hackers can be asses, but all in all it's a recommendable game for friends to play ^^
7239	1	a	As you can see, i am an Argonian, And i require a certain... Type of game, And this game is perfect for me and my reptilian Brethren 10/10 Would Play Again
7241	1	a	Hell of a game. mugging, robbing, and missions. Own this now.
7243	1	a	you will enjoy the game as long as u dont spend real money on it like an idiot so yah spend money on it it sucks but if you dont you will enjoy it
7245	1	a	This game is so recommende if you wanna have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fun 
7247	1	a	1. Multi Player .  2. Open World .  3. Action .  10/10 &lt;3 .
7249	1	a	I &lt;3 This G ame So much!! So much fun kind of like GTA V
7251	1	a	An amazing game that that i wish i could play all the time but the lack of admins and increase of hackers kinda killed it for me. but other then that the game is amazing awsome costum every thing and tons of hrs of fun
7253	1	a	Great game but there's a lil delay when turning
7255	1	a	Like i love this game but YOU NEED A GOOD LAPTOP TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!! I like it this game but the sound is echoing like crazy kn my laptop! So if you have a DELL laptop just get a computer or a better laptop!
7257	1	a	Great game in my opinion ... :3
7259	1	a	Not too bad. If you dont mind the lower graphics and no story, this game is good enough to be a substitute for those who dont have the money for Grand Theft Auto. DLC is a little expensive though.
7261	1	a	I'm generally very picky about games, but this I've enjoyed for 4+ years and still to this day enjoying it! Matter of fact, I bought a gaming computer just to run this game the way I wanted to! No regrets at all! Great and amazing game!
7263	1	a	So awesome couldn't even get it to launch!  11/10
7265	1	a	Good game, but my wallet crying :--(
7267	1	a	Great game but there's a lil delay when turning
7269	1	a	Love it 
7271	1	a	Stephen Hawking runs better than this game.   I can also run The Witcher 3 in Ultra with 60 fps
7273	1	a	It is a nice game overall and a really good replacement for gta. The games graphic is preety simple, nothing extraordinary. the story is not very complex but satisfying. The gameplay mechanics are simple, just point and shoot kinda thing. For me it got really boring really fast because the missions are preety much the same and the gameplay mechanics are not interesting to me. All and all i think that people that like the gridning kinda games will like it.
7275	1	a	Absolute garbage.  This game is the tale of pay to win tryhards vs. trolls who do not give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and with hundreds of customization options under your belt, trolling could never be easier. Nothing quite as satisfying as running over an anime pay2win roleplayer with your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ car plastered with the image of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on the hood.  It's fun to an extent but don't expect depth unless you've got hundreds to spend.
7277	1	a	I really like this game but the new engine â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up the game, so many new updates
7279	1	a	It's fun.
7281	1	a	You're kidding me, only now then they add it on steam.
7283	1	a	I'm generally very picky about games, but this I've enjoyed for 4+ years and still to this day enjoying it! Matter of fact, I bought a gaming computer just to run this game the way I wanted to! No regrets at all! Great and amazing game!
7285	1	a	Great game
7287	1	a	this game is good and bad. pros- -okay gameplay -ultimate customization -feels immersive  cons- -throws curveballs -no story -rough tutorial -unbalanced -skill based
7289	1	a	its ok i guess... 
7291	1	a	Great game, as long as you are willing to spend your life savings on a single car.
7293	1	a	I guess im the only one who likes this game? I just drive around the city really.
7295	1	a	It's pretty much the biggest Pay to Win game out there. Is it fun? With friends, Hell yeah!
7297	1	a	best game in the entire world
7299	1	a	It's good.
7301	1	a	Gang wars with awesome character customatization. I love the game but the only problem is that the developers (thats my opinion not your) dont put too much love to the game because they only add new guns with skins and you need to buy them with money and they do not optimize the game, to make APB more realistic and to increase the quality of the graphics. I mean that is too bad but I give the pozitive review in a hope that the game will be better in the future.
7303	1	a	So awesome couldn't even get it to launch!  11/10
7305	1	a	A long download, when you first start the game, but I can deal with that, and the game is fun
7307	1	a	5/10  Positives: Amazing character customization, great car customization, awesome music studio that allows other players to listen to the music that you create, ragdoll physics (hilarious), graphics and gameplay are decent  Negatives: A lot of cheaters and exploits, terrible customer support, terrible supporting company, cash shop, anti-hack is VERY outdated  Rant: GamersFirst is actually GamersLast. The negatives really outweigh the positives. I had alot of fun back in the closed beta, but G1 (GamersFirst) has allowed cheaters to stay in the game. This is due to the fact that GamersFirst makes tons of money from them. Smart on G1. Also, the players are constantly promised new content, but the new content never shows... unless it shows up on the ARMAS (cash shop).
7309	1	a	very nice game +1000 hours (before steam) very stable and their servers are the greatest! Its not laggy at all..  The matchmaking is so fair and works just fine this game is so fair and good! 10/10 Rage Quit every goddam time!
7311	1	a	A Free Grand Theft auto like game were you can be a Cop or a Crim I recormend it for GTA Fans
7313	1	a	Worthless POS.
7315	1	a	It`s ok to play, i like it
7317	1	a	This game... is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up. BUT I cannot stop playing it. I guess it's not so bad. I have fun with it even though I hate it. The customization is mind blowing and the broken physics are so bad they make it entertaining.
7319	1	a	Played it for a bit. Awesome once you play it for a while but throughout you'll always meet p2w players with better gear.
7321	1	a	My thing wont update so i cant play!?
7323	1	a	This Is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING Good game
7325	1	a	this game could really use melee weapons and a skill try so the player can build his/her character and i would love to bet the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of people with a baseball bat or something but besides that it is pretty fun 
7327	1	a	takes alot of internet but it is worth it if you have good internet
7329	1	a	Nice game!
7331	1	a	It`s ok to play, i like it
7333	1	a	Played it for a bit. Awesome once you play it for a while but throughout you'll always meet p2w players with better gear.
7335	1	a	I was playing this game since release and was following the massive revolution of this game. Awesome game with Rich customization system like: Cars, Clothes, Sounds, Symbols and etc. In another words very awesome Cusomization system. The combo of Shooter game, Cars and Multiplayer IS JUST TOO AWESOME. The good and the bag guys are fighting each other to decide who'll rule San-Paro city... BUT unfortunatly there is a BIG BIG BUT, the game is ruined, as I said, I was following the game revolution from the beggining and I have to say that the more Updates, the more pack they add the game becomes JUST WORSE!!! Meh what's the point... Just in the memory for the good olddays I make good grade but know guys THE GAME IS RUINED, DESTROYED, SMASHED, SUCKS, NON CARE ABOUT IT, FULL OF CHEATERS AND SCAMMERS!!!!!!!
7337	1	a	Theres only 2 side.
7339	1	a	While this game may be somewhat of a drag on your system, if your specs can overcome the hurdle it may possess, it is one hell of a shootin', lootin' team makin' FPSMMORPGRTS. 7/10
7341	1	a	i seriously never understood what i was doing in this game, but it's fun.
7343	1	a	This game has lots of issues, like cheaters, buy to win, timed weapons ( huge BS but it's true), limited world, boring as hell missions (they seem to be different, but they are all the same, just team deathmatch) maps are also boring as hell, those towns are boring as hell, ..... there are some many disadvantages .... , but there are few things that makes this game interesting .... for a while, character creator, clothes creator (not pure, but you can make realy good costume for your character) and that would be all. It's not that bad for a free game, but definitely not worth spending any money for premium or for (give me a break) timed weapons.
7345	1	a	This game is openworld kind of game which give u the freedome to do anything. The game customazation of this game is really good which when u can customize ur character or ur own personal car in anytime u want. U can see my custimazation on my screenshot uploads and u will see how u can totally customize any thing in your own. The gameplay of the mission is good. U have to have teamwork so u can win the game. the game is third personshooter and use it to know where the ally or the enemies are. BIG THUMBS UP FOR THIS GAME!
7347	1	a	I love this game. But there is lots of hackers playing it. So that is the bad side of the story ;) If you are playing as a cop you are cool, because it's not that easy. But if you are the robber then it's just too easy and it's just boring. Believe me. It's a good game. :D (PEACE)
7349	1	a	good game good game i dont even like this game 10/10 I would install and uninstall this game!
7351	1	a	game is bad but its my most played steam game and will probably stay that way forever. god help me
7353	1	a	Love it man just need a good net and a pc but i love this game since gta 5 hasnt released for pc its like a replacement :D
7355	1	a	  Gets game on laptop. Runs at ultra and plays for 25 hours. gets on new gaming pc. cant even get to the luancher before steam crashes.   I do reccomend this game  attempts to fix. 
7357	1	a	I haven't played this game enough to rate it. But i can tell that the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, and weapons in this game are making it awesome! The only bad thing about this game is the community, 50% are hacking russian â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But i enjoyed myself. 9/10
7359	1	a	  this game much fun   
7361	1	a	  Cool try this
7363	1	a	5/5 would flip my 4x4 vegas again
7365	1	a	the best game ever I think everybody will like it :} 
7367	1	a	Car Smashing Griefing Simulator whichever year. Of course there is more than that to this game. You buy clothes, you buy cars, you buy guns and feel fabulous about yourself, but all that comes with real world money or countless hours spent in this game. Is it worth your time you ask? Well if smashing low tier cars into high tier super cars until they explode until you get reported is your cup of tea, by all means create a bald naked fat guy and go ram everyone in the street. Also cherish the time introducing your friends to the game and finding them as disappointed about the community as you are.
7369	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play it. No really, Play it.
7371	1	a	Please, update car physics
7373	1	a	I'm just gonna write basic Pros and Cons of the game, but in general I'm definitely a fan.  Pros: - Awesome customization, sliders to customize face and body in anyway you want, also available customization for clothes and cars. - Fast paced - Cops vs robbers / good vs bad theme - Easy lvl up as a Criminal - Great to play with a group of friends  Cons: - Devs abandoned the game for quite some time (originally APB), now we have APB: Reloaded (which is now slightly abandoned also) - Community usually quite arrogant to newcomers, and despite it being a 18+ game quite imature people. Dont expect immediate help being a newbie in this game, or at any point. - The side that has less players online is harder to play for - Harder to lvl up as enforcer (which is a bit unfair) - Hackers... (usually enforcers, but ocassionaly criminals).  (Not all pros and cons are listed (obviously), those are just the ones that I notice the most (and that I care more about))  But, you should try it, if you don't mind the cons.
7375	1	a	dis game very good. i like the part where u build square blocks and mine stuff. 10/10 IGN
7377	1	a	
7379	1	a	After a few hours it will be boring
7381	1	a	this game is the best
7383	1	a	yes i would pros free roaming ish you can rob you can be a cop or villian and more cons the frist wepon needs to be buffed beause of how little damage it does and snipers need to have scopes on most because most dont that i us i have got a pistol with ine but not a sniper and the way u play limited still yes i would
7385	1	a	i played the game for 12 hours and i think to my self this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fun canda game for poeple like me of mmo's and mmorpg's and moba's i don't like the game but i like a bit of it i grown on me to play the game i hope the fix the car's driving error's that i have who can drive like that i recommend playing it on your own risk if you like this game i like to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with this game and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all the player 'up' and ya msg me if you like it but not realy like it
7387	1	a	It's a very nice game :P The Graphics aren't the best but alot of fun :D
7389	1	a	Cool 
7391	1	a	Decent game, kind of pay to win but most weapons that you buy are just the same weapons you start with you have but reskinned. Lot's of customization and fun to play with friends and you can just absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around.         9.5/10 kill more crims
7393	1	a	Just Awesome
7395	1	a	hmm 10/10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'s out for harambe
7397	1	a	great game :D
7399	1	a	the community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trash and so funny at the same time i legit suggest you play this just for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing around with them  
7401	1	a	This review is a little bit long but here we go, Actually its more a getting-it-off-the-chest review than a real review  Once upon a time, there was a company called 'Hoplon' they decided to bring the game to Brazil, so they made a deal with gamefirst, you guys block every Brazilian IP from your servers, and we will force all Brazilians to play in ours(if they want to play). So we had to do so, We played on their servers(However, I really wanted to play on gamefirst's servers, 'cause hoplon wouldn't put new weapons and stuff in the game, they just would use same models and then give them new names and say 'new guns, give us money, I mean 'buy them'') we spent a lot of money on the game. We used to have awesome accounts, with a lot of gears and guns and whatnot. Then they decided to end the contract. And the great bomb was dropped, all Brazilians are allowed to play on gamefirst's severs, forced actually. But they haven't immigrated our accounts to gamefirsts yet So we are totally obligated to start from the zero, while there are already a myriad of gamers in their servers with top accounts. Which means our money and time on our real accounts were completely wasted up until now.  If they ever ever immigrate our accounts, I'll edit this review  They've immigrated the accounts,then it's working perfectly
7403	1	a	Don't know why I'm still playing it, but I am.      10/10
7405	1	a	I really like the game. It might look like its hard to get into but with the help of some friends you can get better really quickly.
7407	1	a	Its a great game to play similar to Grand Theft Auto
7409	1	a	Alot of pay2win elements, and there is no chance for you to win against players who've spent over 300$ on this game, cuz they got more 'power' cuz of bought modifications and stronger weapons.  Balance is not always good, ''mostly''   I've played this game around 100-200 hours and i do recommend it if you are in state to give money to it and kick some asses as a pay2win player.
7411	1	a	A poor mans GTA V so why not get it right it's free doesnt have much game content but it is still fun to play but it does have some pay to win aspects
7413	1	a	Basically the entirety of this game:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  nwa â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the police hq&nbsp;
7415	1	a	Is a fun game best to play with friends
7417	1	a	Couldn't last a second without hackers 10/10
7419	1	a	Im not kidding, but my computer was so bad that 20hrs were spent trying to launch it and one time when I closed it, it didnt close properly.
7421	1	a	Great game.
7423	1	a	This game is actually pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good.  It takes a lot of practice, consistent playing &amp; willingness to learn and adapt to its unique brand of combat but once you do, especially with a few friends, you can kick so much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. There is nothing more satisfying than outplaying a team of hackers simply because you have better mapknowledge &amp; practiced skill with the unique weapon systems.  I think one of the biggest things that throws people off is the idea that guns only deal damage at certain ranges, too many times do I see an NTEC 5 user shooting an enemy at 80m+ and wondering why he doesn't get a kill.

7427	1	a	It's great game about cops and criminals but need some huge update....
7429	1	a	its so bad its good
7431	1	a	is this old? plz tell
7433	1	a	For every good there is something bad in this game.  [+] The customization is amazing. This game is not pay to win. Events occur fairly often.  [-] THERE IS A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE. The team behind this game almost always fails to deliver on their promises. We haven't seen a big update in over a year. Progression takes a long time. Dying player base.   Somehow, I constantly find myself coming back to play APB.
7435	1	a	This game rocks and sucks at the same time! But i love it and i keep comin back to kill peeps :P &lt;3 it!
7437	1	a	Pay2win? Dude star is op as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7439	1	a	I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years. There's something about it that's so addicting. Sure I have GTA and all that, but it's just not the same. It's a gem amidst all the other free to play games. Really it is...  There is a big emphasis on teamwork so grouping with a friend is recommended. Best character customization I have seen to date. It has its flaws and is highly pay to win. The matches are competitive but when you do kick a person's â™¥â™¥â™¥ that has spent a ton of money on the game from outsmarting them and knowing the tips and tricks well damn that makes you feel like a god.
7441	1	a	Ok so I have been kind of addicted to this game for over a year now. Its my first venture into a true PVP game. The community is ok once you find other players willing to help teach you the game and play along your side until you get the mechanics figured out. The match making is pretty bad and there are alot of people who play in zones where they don't belong (you will have issues with getting killed alot and not getting many kills when you start) out once you figure it out and you keep in the back of your mind that this is only a game and you don't rage quit it turns out to be pretty good.
7443	1	a	Awsome game must play and be a criminal of course :D
7445	1	a	The concept of this game is great, but sadly it's under-developed and underlooked by many people.  A lot of reviews claim that the game is P2W, and while it is true that progression speed is slowed by half when you don't have the bonus premium XP, most of the items that can be found in the ingame store are either purely cosmetic, or reskins/remodels of the weapons that are F2P, sometimes even having inferior stats to those due to the preset mods that come with the cash store models.  An advice to anyone who's considering playing this game though: Do not even think about playing this alone. You'll need to make friends ingame if you really want to enjoy it to the fullest. Playing solo will get old fast, moreso than in other games.
7447	1	a	is this old? plz tell
7449	1	a	I really like the game. It might look like its hard to get into but with the help of some friends you can get better really quickly.
7451	1	a	
7453	1	a	It's Free, it's Fun, why wouldn't you play it?
7455	1	a	Pretty steep learning curve. Pretty salty community. The costimization options a wicked!
7457	1	a	APB is a game that has been around for quite a while on steam, its kept standards but has dissapointed at certain times. However i was and am willing to overlook this because of the freedom i gain by playing APB and how it can be enjoyed not only by just playing the game, but researching into events and new fun things to try! :D  Defintley recommend this game. :)
7459	1	a	Good game, but the engien they're using, is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ potato..
7461	1	a	Pretty steep learning curve. Pretty salty community. The costimization options a wicked!
7463	1	a	For every good there is something bad in this game.  [+] The customization is amazing. This game is not pay to win. Events occur fairly often.  [-] THERE IS A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE. The team behind this game almost always fails to deliver on their promises. We haven't seen a big update in over a year. Progression takes a long time. Dying player base.

7465	1	a	cool
7467	1	a	no headshots&lt;3.
7469	1	a	Good game considering it's free. Fun if played with friends but solo is boring
7471	1	a	Im not kidding, but my computer was so bad that 20hrs were spent trying to launch it and one time when I closed it, it didnt close properly.
7473	1	a	Overall 7/10  Pros: +Customization is very well put into focus +Level of detail is amazing of the level/word +Music is good (few annoying songs plus you can maek your own mixtape) +Lots to do +Decent economy (no WoW farming money) +In-game market +Localization (havent met a person from another country/timezone) //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Cons: -Pay 2 Win (some guns are way to OP and takes a 200 hour account to earn them on a F2P) -Premium is a option to buy for boosted stats and more cusomization -Broken world loading (empty servers of crims doing ram raids) -No Bulletdrop/Sniper rifles being way out of range but having the ability to 2 shot people (weapon in balence) -Cheaters (F2P game obviusly there will be some) -No large scale missions (server wide missions) -G1 has decided to run this more of a side business (Updates are usually seasonaly and only add more store features) //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Want to play a true version of this look up 'APB EMU .com'  (http://apbemu.com/)  when this releases I will most definetely be spending time on this.  Reccomendation: Look at 'Identity rpg' that is a mix between Arma 3 and GTA V  (http://www.identityrpg.com/)  this looks and feels like a nice mmorpg when it will get relaesed if you can wait for another year or so.
7475	1	a	its a fun game you should play with friends. The driving is bad but its pretty fun
7477	1	a	Basically the entirety of this game:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  nwa â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the police hq&nbsp;
7479	1	a	It says the game is already running but the game is not running.How do I fix this issue?
7481	1	a	A poor mans GTA V so why not get it right it's free doesnt have much game content but it is still fun to play but it does have some pay to win aspects
7483	1	a	Hard to get into and got to have lots of skill to master. But its the most relaxad ragegame and you feel so rewarded to get one kill! Lots of customation of characters and viechles. Exiting gameplay. Playable for hours.
7485	1	a	5 words: Best. Law. Criminal. Game. EVER.   The game is mainly a game where you can be a cop or a criminal, The fact you can have TWO+ playable characters is good. You cancustomize it, ETC.
7487	1	a	As of December 22 of 2016 this game is probably one of my favorite games and the most toxic game I have ever played.   To people wanting to know if this game is fun and has content, it does have content and it is fun. But beware of that this game has a toxic community because of people get mad over you being better than them.  Pros - fun - content - customization   Cons - CPU intensive/ ram - toxic community - devs/admins not active - matchmaking (broken) - MoneyZfirst (they'll care about making a quick buck) - no optimization (help your performance)  I wish luck to those who decide to play this game.   Please do keep in mind this is based on my opinion on the game and what it had to offer for the 2 years I've played it, maybe later I write a better review getting in depth about the game and what to expect.
7489	1	a	Pro:  I wouldnt say this is the best game righ now, but this game is amazing. It has a great potential to be the best open mmo open world game ever and rise to the top. It has a crazy customization feature and a smart world system where you can socialize, play with friends, a different server to play against each other or talk in virtual world. Literally nice concepts........   Contra: But yeah, This game needs an anti cheat, fix some issue &amp; glitch, a more fair gameplay and to do a lot of fun stunts, expand the world with more vehicle and AI
7491	1	a	It's a great game that i have played for a lot more hours then this indicates, by like 50x. but what made me stop playing originally (even though i've just come back) is the hackers, the crashes and mostly hackers at the time.  I still think this is one of the most impressive MMO's ever made and i hope i can enjoy it a bit now that i am back. do recommend that people try the game
0	0	a	After clocking over 1000 hours on this game (300+ before steam merge) playing since 2012, i have remained a faithful customer through thick and thin, even spent a total of $560 USD ($768 AUD) on in game items like cars , clothes guns... even got a nice collection of legendaries but up untill a few days ago when i couldnt log into my account due to it being BLOCKED?  After contacting Gamersfirst regarding the issue, they palmed me off to Punkbuster who informed me i have a global ban due to cheating...(WTF!!??), they informed me there is no way to tell how or who but all they know is there was an interference with punkbuster so they refuse to lift the ban because they said it might happen again, so i sent another ticket pleading my case and what was happening at time of block(which was closing apb with task manager due to game crash) and they just deleted without even reading  Today i have recieved an email from gamersfirst saying my account is cancelled and pretty much 'smell ya later'  VERDICT: Dont give these guys a cent and dont ever think they care about their customers because they clearly dont. i've always encounterd hackers in this game and always annoyed me, but being banned for hacking when you werent is absolutely disgusting.

1	0	a	The most toxic community I have ever met.
2	0	a	this game could have been the best online shooter of the 21st century.  but gamersfirst.
3	0	a	After having played this game for 3 years and put over 1000 hours into it. I can say for certain that this game is a fundamentally flawed broken unfinished piece of sh!t, no one wants to play this game and FOR A GOOD REASON.  Apb has a huge potential to be something great, It has the hands down best customization any game ever made has to offer. You can create your own cars and clothing and truely be anything you want to be with little limitation. But on the gameplay side of things, while the the idea behind the gameplay and the missions and all that stuff is solid, the fundamental design flaws prevents it from living up to that potential. On top of that, the game is littered with many bugs, imbalances and, serious client side and crippling server side performance issues. And most importantly, this game attracts and empowers a lot of duchebags to do maximum duchebaggery, they are like the soul of APB (and not in a good way)  So what are these fundamental game design flaws?  Map designs that do not take into account what this game is about and how it is played, players love exploiting the flawed map designs to cheat the mission by placing items on high up unreachable places and obstructing or destroying the only way to get there, making the whole mission invalid and granting them an automatic win. Or putting the item in a car and circumvent the speed penalty for doing so by just pushing the car with another car and driving on the part of the map that is impossible to intercept.  Mission designs that give no consideration to the locations or nonsensical objectives that dont take into consideration the nature of the game. For example, investigating an ATM in a middle of an open 80-150m space with no cover and surrounded by sniping positions. Or pointless objectives that are impossible for one of the teams to do, like stopping a car from going through 3 unspecified checkpoints on random locations on the map. Some mission objectives are placed in locations that greatly favor one of the teams.   Almost all missions in this game require you to camp the objective, the whole game is based on camping and some combinations of map locations and mission objectives make it impossible to finish some missions because the enemy team is camping some roof top that has only one way up with guns pointed at it and is too high to be sniped.  Theres also weapons that dont belong in this game, Such as the OSMAW rocket launcher that makes any semblance of a balance in this game, hit rock bottom.  No one will ever fight fair, they will use every dirty trick in the book, any given opportunity to cheat the mission and will have no mercy for your rank 25 noob as.s.  They will be rude and obnoxious about it, they will message you without provocation just to insult you during or after the mission when they won it. The forum community is just as rotten.  I also have to mention the broken matchmaking that throws low level beginner players against high level duchebags that have unlocked every possible balance breaking gear and know every possible game exploit and are not ashamed to use all that to stomp the low level new players that dont have jack sh!t unlocked. The more game breaking gear is, the higher level locked it is, making sure that people who dont need it to win the mission have it and people who could really use it dont, witch tips the scales to a 90 angle between both sides.   If you have no job and live in your mom's basement, even you will find this game to be the biggest grind fest ever conceived, if you do not have a sh!t bucket nearby, this game is not for you. Even with premium, be prepared to put at least 400 hours to get on a level playing field with the rest of the players or your as.s will be stomped every mission you do. You will get 90% grind and 10% actual enjoyment before you get to a point where you have all the necessary gear unlocked and can start playing the game just for fun.  If all of this wasnt enough, G1' is 'working hard' to add all kinds of new and exciting ways to be an as.shole in the game. Such as the 'car surfer' character mod that allows your character to ride on top of a car and fire any bul.lsh!t weapon you want at your opposition who is chasing you and blowing up their car, eliminating every little remaining chance for the enemy team to get their hands on that item you are running away with like a pus.sy instead of fighting, throwing out the last remaining bit of fairness and balance out the window and ensuring the victory for your team.  A car surfing OSMAW as.shole on top of a car with other cowboy hat duchebags is like a cherry on top of a stinking sh!t cake. It is the symbol of everything that is wrong with this game.  i also forgot to mention, the gun play is a joke, there is no proper bullet collisions with map objects, making you hit invisible forcefields and random objects you arent even aiming at, your weapons lock up and dont shoot if you pressed shoot a tiny bit too soon after you finished climbing a ladder or getting out of the car. There is no such thing as hitboxes for body parts or headshots or any of that modern stuff, the whole player is one big hitbox (usualy bigger than the player model so they can kill you without even touching you. The servers run on a 40ms (ideal conditions - also never) tick rate that effects the gun play, and other aspects of the game. This means things only happen every 40ms, you can feel this delay the most when you are driving a car or pressing F to do an action, you can also see the shots you fired at lets say a car, hit it after some delay. This is kind of a problem to the gun play, you get the kill or not depends a lot not on your skill but on factors like if your shots are at the beginning or the end of that 40ms gap, witch is also greatly effected by crippling server side lag issues. It also seems that some people are favored by the server over others, they are so called lag armor users or people that kill you faster than the max fire rate of the weapon they are using. Its different from person to person, i guess the server somehow lines up people in a specific order when it processes information coming from them. There is also a big problem called ghost shots, its when you shoot but for whatever reason the server doesnt register any of your shots.  So yeah, this game is a really good idea, but the execution is terrible, dont waste your time unless you are a masochist like me.  TL;DR  Serious client side performance issues and crippling server side performance and bugs. Maps designed for the wrong game. Missions placed blindly, not taking location consideration or what game this even is. Rude community, especially on the forums. Camping, Using exploits, taking advantage of the fundamental design flaws and other kinds of cheating to win missions. This game is 10% fun and 90% frustrating grind. Balance breaking Weapons that do not belong in this type of game.
4	0	a	  After two years of playing this game, I have finally come to a point in which I can review it in full for what it is. And to be truthful, the positives are beginning to fade leaving merely negatives.     APB: Reloaded is a shadow of its former self in many regards, and these days is a shambling mess that won't warrant attention for much longer. With a dwindling playerbase and a greedy publisher, things have been turning sour as of late. Years ago during the original APB, the game looked and performed better for what it provided. Sure, it was a mess back then and it still is now. But some aspects were better back then, from what I've heard.  As a player who had played the game for well over 2,900 hours, I have experienced just about all there is to be offered by the game. And maintaining my honesty, there's some great potential locked away in this game. The potential for player designed content is stunning, and no other game provides such depth for customization on such a broad scale. Other games like EvE Online might provide an excellent character creation suite, and racing games like Forza (can't recall which one specifically) that have in depth car customization exist... But no other game brings systems akin to those present in other titles all into one MMO. Sounds great, doesn't it? If only it wasn't nearly impossible to get into the game.  Back a couple of years ago when I started playing APB:R, there were times I had to force myself to play to get accustomed to the game. I loved it too much to let it go, but it wasn't doing me any favours because it was (and still is) very harsh on new players. All the new free content is almost exclusively available to high ranking players with lots of experience, or to those who wish to become a wallet warrior using the in game cash shop. Now, to put it bluntly... No, I do not think APB is very Pay2Win. Are there some P2W aspects present in the game? Yeah, there is. But almost all of the things that will affect you in an actual match, things that dictate your performance against other players, can be achieved without dropping a dollar on the game. Most paid items merely exist as a shortcut to something that you can still earn on your own, but it'll take a lot of work to get those items.   But, more on the subject of the game rather than the playerbase; how is it really? Well, it's a glorified version of Cops vs Robbers you used to play as a kid in your back yard when you were a kid. That, and then an insane amount of customization potential. The customization elements are rock solid and very enjoyable to use, and you'd be very surprised with the things that some people are capable of creating in game. But the game... How does it run? Well, poorly. The thing about a lot of people who play Free2Play games is that they aren't usually very wealthy and can't afford much in terms of paid games or a strong computer to play them on. APB tends to perform rather badly for some lower end hardware configurations which frankly kills that part of the market. Unless you have a very high end computer, you best be ready for feeling serious stuttering in game. However the dedicated servers that the game is hosted on are also rather bad. The server hardware is slowly being worked on to be upgraded, but it will take a long time for full deployment of the new hardware. Unfortunately, the new hardware that provides better server quality (not by much) is only high end consumer grade desktop hardware. Not server grade stuff... But consumer grade stuff. Disappointing, really.  The combat in game is somewhat hampered at times due to the condition of the servers, which results in poor hit detection for some people and frequent lag spikes on certain servers with the older server hardware. Driving can also be awkward, as driving in APB isn't like in other games. According to the developers, certain things are bound to the server and you have to interact with the server in order to interact with certain items... Like vehicles. There's an easily noticeable delay in steering and throttle for vehicles as you are technically sending commands to the server to move your vehicle, then waiting for it to confirm those actions and send information back to you for your game to display on your monitor. So to put it briefly, the combat and driving can be rather clunky at times.  All in all though, is the game worth it to try and get into? Currently, it's not quite there. Unless you absolutely adore the customization options available, then it isn't really worth your time to start playing it right now. The amount of headaches you'll have to deal with is a massive turn off for fresh players. Not to mention the community is quite frankly rubbish. There's trolling jerks left and right, along with closet cheaters that mask their cheats as skill in order to make up for their own shortcomings so they can be good at a mere video game. A better time to jump on this game would have been a little over a year ago, but things are improving so it might be new player friendly again sometime soon. Currently the devs are working on updating the core engine of APB: R to make things substantially better from a development point of view, but if they can't make that work and create new content to keep people around... Well, this game won't become the MMO everyone plays and it'll just be another MMO that most people just look at once and say 'nah...'. It's up to you if you want to jump into this game how it is now, as it's rough in a lot of spots but a few things shine so bright.  Game Rating: 7/10 for what the game is capable of, but 5/10 for the community that calls APB:R home.
5	0	a	Date was like 2/3 years ago.  I've played this game for years and right at the end it turned into a Pay to Win game with hackers every where.  Im not going to pay 40$ for a Ingame gun...  Since people keep commenting on my Review here is an update to stop everyone arguing with me.  The premium Weapon are Far better like the shotgun has a fixed pattern to its spread so if aimed right it would one shot you. The premium HVR allowed you to run with it when the non premium would not. The premium Car parts gave a boost to you vehicle to allow you to over power non premium users. the list can go on of small things that over time will add up..  I under stand they need to make money to keep the game alive... however I believe it should be kept at a cosmetic level of game play not core mechanic of the game.. not to mention the idea of renting a gun for a week for real money or spending 40$ US to own the gun, Like really I might as well buy another game for that price..   Bottom line is I shouldn't have to be a MLG level of gaming just to compete with some casual gamer who spends 80+ dollars a week to get an over powered weapon/car.
6	0	a	The game itself is in my opnion close to perfection IF! it had the been released right the first time. With no bugs more content.  Pros: The gameplay is amazing. driving cars is fun and different. some cars are hard at first and so satisfying to drive when you get the hang of it. The shooting in the game is also really amazing (tho it was far better before they started infesting it with new weapons) every gun is different. like playing a new game every time you change weapons. social district without a doubt the most unique part of this game.  Cons: The company behind it is absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. They are only focused on milking their players for money and as much as they can. They barely update the game anymore. hasent been a good update for years. The players in the game are toxic and mostly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. its near inpossible to find a decent human being on it. Hackers, this game as been dealing with cheaters since it came out. Tho less hackers than you would think.   i would not recommend this game at all what so ever right now. the game went from almost finished to alpha stage. has only gone downhill since g1 took over this game.  I have spent 2500+ hours on this game. and this is all my opnion.
7	0	a	I have played this god forsaken for hours, hours, ive spent an ungodly amount of money on this game. Because that is practically the only way to do good in this game. The community of this game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t full of awful people. If you are actually good at third person shooters then do not get this game. You will constantly be called a hacker. You will eventually get banned just as i have, and in return lose everything youve worked for. I was max rank with everything unlocked and i payed the price for being accused a hacker. I know sit at home staring at my screen wishing that i could punch the C.E.O of Gamersfirst in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing face. This Game's Community, and EVERYTHING it stands for is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T!
8	0	a	Review Update: The link that showed proof to the corrupt devs has been removed by the original poster, It had nothing to do with protecting the corrupt devs.  TL;DR Version at bottom
9	0	a	After playing this game for about 3-4 years (and even giving a presentation about it for my highschool english final, kill me inside) I finally got the guts to quit playing it.  This game can be classified as GTA's artistic (no, not autistic) cousin who died off early due to a birth defect but was resurrected by the power of money and a dream that is constantly being battered down by a poor community and a money-hungry company.  I'm not berating this game. The only problems I have with the game is its toxic community (aside from some hand-picked few), the fact you have to pay for everything, and the graphics get worse each year. I still do come back to it to make some friend's custom symbols for when they ask. This game was great for what it was at the time. A F2P multiplayer Grand Theft Auto for the PC in which you can customize just about everything you ever wanted. But for the community and the company that hosts the game? I'd be taping a huge DO NOT CROSS banner on it if you're looking for a game to main. Play this game only if you have a bunch of friends to join in to kill time.  The game is great for what it delivers as a 2008 (or around that?) game. - You can lean around corners and you're allowed a wide-range of weaponry consisting of but not limited to: On-Impact Grenades, Light-weight Snipers, Rocket Launchers, IRL Paid-For Legendary Pistols that do better than any of the F2P rifles in the game (I'm looking at you Nano &lt;3), half a brick, and even snowballs. - The Vehicle system is great allowing you to buy a bunch of epic looking cars that (for real life money) you can modify just like Need For Speed Underground with the body kits, car seats, dump valves, radio waves, and monkeys. - You can run around two different pretty big cityscapes ranging at 1k+ meters and traverse it the way you want by either running around or driving cars (or surfing on em). - It contains one of the best character and car customization systems out there, allowing you to make symbols by the use of manipulating random shapes/vectors and placing them on a vast amount of character clothing and vehicles. - You're also able to change the music people hear when you kill them, music that gets played out your car, and music that you can play in a portable stereo system. (Yes I know, its as epic as it seems) - And you can even chill in the game's social area where you can edit your car, clothes, face, and just hangout with other bros and bro-dettes.  All-in-all if you want a game in which to customize stuff with, this is your game. However you practically have to pay to get everything, otherwise have fun spending thousands of hours trying to unlock everything. Also don't play this game if you get mad really easily, that's my final word on this.
10	0	a	Updated as of 26/08/2016: So as a game that I have known for over 5 years now, there are times where you feel like coming back just to see what's up, and see if anyone you once knew is still playing. Keep in mind I haven't quit this game, but more of retiring from it until futher notice.  Now I can agree with a large amount of new players who have just tried this game, yes there are a few hackers out there, it makes it fustrating and you never want to touch this game again unless they fix it. However you'll find some sort of cheater in any F2P game, whether it be an aimbot, they're abusing a glitch, wallhacks, invincibility, etc. I understand that with FairFight they're trying to push back the amount of hackers in the game, but with each new day that passes by, these people will find a way to try and bypass it and survive on this game a little longer, even if it means one extra hour of tormenting the playerbase, and once that character is banned, it's that easy for them to make a whole new account and start it all over again.  However I've put up with my fair share of hackers and all that crap over the past 5 years in this game, and while it does tend to annoy me, it's never gotten to me to the point I've uninstalled APB. I just put up with it and wait for the next mission. My problem with this game at the moment, is the lack of content recently. It's been over 2 years now since the last contacts were released, and basically everyone who is R255 either sits in social cause there's nothing to do, they make a brand new character and level that to 255, rinse-repeat, or just leave the game until something new comes up to bring them back for a short period. Some players have even asked for a new game-mode, such as turf wars or racing district, instead of picking between repeated missions with the same opp, or fight club.  But what do we get instead? Joker box after joker box with a new gun that tends to be useless compared to some of the original weapons, and then you decide to release another version of that JMB weapon for credits or by forcing your players to spend 100's of dollars just to get it as a loyalty reward. I get it, a free-to-play game needs to get it's revenue from somewhere, and for APB it's the marketplace, but to care more about another gamble box over actual content for players in action districts like a new contact? No wonder why everytime I get on the game looks dead as f**k.  It really dissapoints me, as I saw alot of potential in this game, but to see where it's landed itself now makes me wish I could pull the plug on it before it suffers any longer. So to anyone who's thinking about installing this game, as a veteran of this game, I suggest you hold back and wait, it's not worth the hard drive space as of this moment.
11	0	a	I have played this game for nearly four years and invested over 1500 hours into the game as well as a god-awful amount of money that I regret each time I spend. I have quit, come back, quit, come back, etc. in a cycle that's really hard to break. Let me just say that I am posting my review of this game as someone who has not been banned and has seen every side of the game and community.  The game is akin to cocaine, if I'm completely honest. At first it's great, but the more you do it the worse it gets and while you know you really should just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stop you can't.  Some pros of the game include the customization, which is without a doubt top notch - you really don't get much better than the customization they offer. The PVP aspect of it is, over all, fairly entertaining and really quite fun. But that's about where the pros stop.  The cons include an unbalanced threat system to determine matches, micro-transactions (that really aren't all that micro) to get any kind of good customization, cars, weapons, etc., unresponsive devs &amp; GMs (who are inconsistent and biased at best), a hitbox that is the same on the tallest/fattest character as it is on the shortest/skinniest one, an anti-cheat system that is easy to bypass and isn't consistent, and an overall toxic community that honestly reminds me of COD and their never ending comments about what they did to someone's mom last night.  As much as I hate it I will keep playing it. I honestly don't understand why. I hate the game, I hate the community, and yet at the same time I hold out that hope that one day G1 will be worth a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and actually fix the damn thing.  TL;DR: if you're not already playing the game, don't.
12	0	a	'Engine Update this year' -2013
13	0	a	Don't let my hours fool you, I also have several thousand on their standalone client. This game isn't worth your time unless you're already a veteran, and we veterans only play because of very flawed and irrational reasons.  Infested with cheaters of every flavor, community is a toxic cesspit with only a few good people, cash shop has stopped pretending altogether that it isn't pay to win, etc.  If I could take back all the years and thousands of dollars I've put into this game, I would do so in a heartbeat... even if that time and money wasn't returned to me.  Reloaded Games is unethical, unprofessional, and just plain greedy. They're still not worse than EA, but they definitely would give EA a run for its money.  Also, yes, this is partly a rant. However, that doesn't change the simple fact that it's truth.  So yes, go ahead and dismiss this review, and waste your time (and inevitably money) downloading this game... but don't say you weren't warned about what you would be subjected to.
14	0	a	If you enjoy playing a game in permanent beta, this game is for you.  While I've clocked many hours (have another 1.5k+ before the steam merge), I don't think I can reccomend this game to anyone. It's just not worth investing time into for new people. Older players only play it because we got hooked early on, and most of us are nostalgic or for some reason holding onto hope for the game.   I wish this game could hit it's potential that it had even back in 2010/2011, but it's not very likely, even with the 'engine update' that's supposed to be here by the end of this year. Don't bet on that though, they also said it was supposed to release back in Q1 2014, and look where we are :). G1 has been worse than Nexon, and that's a great warning sign for anyone interested in trying this game out.   If you're still interested, despite all the negative reviews, by all means go ahead. Just remember, you were warned.
15	0	a	It was fun while it lasted, the missions are too repetitive and the dialogue is poor and un interesting, the city is dull and full of mindless civilians that run in front of you or get in the way while you are trying to gun someone down the progression is the slowest i have ever played, the game is full of hackers and ddosers, the community cries and hackusates everyone who is good, the clothing in the armas marketplace is too overpriced and the weapons, all people do in this game is just sit in social district and talk $hit to one another, it's a good free to play game.. but you will get dominated by the crap matchmaking if you are starting fresh off a new character, only good thing in this game is the in deph customization that no other mmo has, but other than that it's mostly just a 'social simulator' full of cry babies and rage quiters and hackers, So if you wanna play it go ahead it's Free to Play but be prepared to be destroyed by the higher ranks..  'CAUTION: PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!'
16	0	a	APB is a classic case of great concept done very poorly. After watching it 'evolve' over time I have come to this conclusion about APB and its design. I will try to stay the concise points for easy reading. - Designed to promote negativity between players (yes the game is PVP however they make no genuine effort to promote teamwork and community building between players) - Missions are 50% easily one sided, 25% one sided based upon player tallents, and only 25% resonably balanced based on the objectives themselves. - Developement is focused more toward re-releasing the original game content for a cash fee than resolving long standing issues and design flaws. - They have been gradually improving the player threat system so it more accurately reflects a persons skill. - The one truly good feature for the game is the character and vehicle design system that allows a high level of customization of look by use of symbols. - Vehicle driving and performance is what you would expect from any game. - Gun mechanics are sloppy and often glitchy. They add unneeded features in a failed attempt to balance weapons. - Limited options for PVP play, you either do missions which have a standard theme or do Fight Club which is basically a moshpit of players killing players with a mission objective of some basic sort. - Developement has issues with breaking things when adding or making 'improvements' slow to never fix issues and glitches.  Overall the game is poorly maintained, poorly developed, and has a good concept with a few nice features. It earns a 4 out of 10  **update 11/20/2015** READ THE AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU INSTALL!!! (all examples provided are paraphrased) Pando part talks about how they are not liable for anything that happens even if it is their fault. Punkbuster part clearly states they have full rights inspect the contents of your Hard Drive, RAM, etc while it is running and even take screenshots which they can use publically. Before that they state it is always running and updates without giving any notice to you which btw anyone who has installed APB before knows it installs a punkbuster windows service that runs all the time in the background unless you manually disabled it. That is but a small taste of what is in that agreement..   I WILL NEVER INSTALL APB AGAIN! I also advise for the safety of your PC and data that you also never install this game!
17	0	a	The Good, The Bad, The Ugly  |Review|   The good:   If you love playing cops 'n robbers in various areas of a city, crashing into shops and stealing loot or arresting criminals and returning the stolen goods this game is for you. On top of that you have a VERY detailed customization system that will keep you occupied as well as composing music when you die to making detailed symbols and pictures. A decent ammount of guns and equipment sets give you various different styles of gameplay and approaches to certain missions. If you want to take a break from the chaos of the city and just want to shoot people they have TDM maps where you can frag at your leisure. As one of my most played games in my library I found much enjoyment in this game and even though I go on hiatus from time to time I will find myself crawling back eventually.    The BAD:   Its really a shame that Real time worlds (the original creators of the game) went bankrupt because they rushed a game that could of been something so much greater than what it is now. Even though it was brought back to life and handed over to some free to play company no one has ever heard of I was still glad it was given a second chance. From the start I had high hopes that GamersFrist would give this game some dignity and held that vision that some of the core developers of this game had. However even for as long as they have had the game you can't notice much change in the game itself. Yes they have events but its just mission events that really don't mean anything, its just regular missions painted in what ever holiday it happens to be. Also there used to be a good rapport between the GF and the gaming community. Maybe that has changed but since then but I left when we didn't hear a world from our devs and were swimming in problems...   The FRIGGIN' UGLY:  Of course free to play comes at a cost. How are they going to fund this game and create more content for the players and make this game better? Microtransactions. A concept on paper that really (at least in my opinion) seems harmless. But when a company MAINLY focuses on the content for thier in game shop you begin to see the true colors of what thier intent is. With little to almost nonexistant game updates, content and almost some new item every week in the in game store you can notice that either...   A) someone is having money trouble B) Cash cow circle jerk  This game to me was a work of art and gave me so much fun and enjoyment that I wish thier marketing schemes didn't get to me. If you think i'm â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ting you just look at thier facebook account. THERE IS BARLEY ANY OTHER POSTS OTHER THAN ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THIER SHOP ITEMS. Zero â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t go look... All this makes the player not want to even log in... Its that obnoxious. But I get it, you got to make some money. But how about make the game more enjoyable, make the gamers keep coming back and of course they'll buy something. Don't pray on the very few people in your community that spends hundreds of dollars on in game items.   THIS. IS. WHAT. MAKES. YOU. SO. DAMN. UNATTRACTIVE.  This was a major issue for me but other uglies include.  -low pop -meh ranking system -has been almost the same since beta.   Take it or leave it folks. Thumbs down but take a peak anyways. You might not care about the advert spam. Maybe its changed.
18	0	a	To make this short: I played this a few years ago, and had a blast. Elistist were few and in between, Game mechanics were nice, Customization was awesome. I tried picking it up again, hell, put 20 more hours into it, but I can't get past the Huge, absolutely Huge elitist base it has now. As a silver, it would make sense to be on a server that is meant for silvers (A silver server) and fight people at roughly my skill level, as that's how the rating system goes. However, Max Rank (255, I'm 96, takes about an 2-3 hours a rank) Gold players with over 2000 hours of playtime are your only constant enemies. They claim that they can't fill their own servers so they play on our silver, when they have a gold server dedicated to them, but In truth they just want to waste their lives away absolutely stomping anyone trying to enter the fanbase of this game. The greatest curse is not the pernament weapon p2win, but it's the community devouring itself with inbalance of skill.   If you knew you would lose absolutely every single game, why would you bother staying in the game? That's this games motto. The Golds act like Jerks to everyone, with heavy elitist attitudes, and are unstoppable because they have 1000% (literally) more game time then you do. There's no reason to play or join into the game because you can not win no matter what you do. On top of that, They complain because the fanbase is dwindling in numbers (about 100-200 people on at once, which is very small,) and in that, they justify their mad stomping out of weaker, much less experienced players. This game deserves to be condemned and shut down because of it's terrible Elistist structure. 
19	0	a	[Wall of text,that is more of a rant ,but i think it's worth talking about]  I will review this game,but first,let me tell you about the tragic tale of the now Free 2 Play APB.
20	0	a	Been playing APB on and off since the RTW beta, and I think I've finally quit for good. G1 has implemented some excellent and much needed changes, but so much has been broken in the process that I don't enjoy the game anymore. As I post this, server lag is worse than ever with rubber-banding ocurring every 5 minutes. Cheaters are still rampant and unchecked, and probably G1's biggest real-money customers to boot. New content that gets added is either nigh exclusive to max rank players or only on the ARMAS marketplace, meaning more casual players have no chance to even learn the strengths and weaknesses of new weapons. Let's not even mention how any semblance of gun balance went out the window as they kept pumping out more and more weapons to bloat the already full roles that the original content filled.  I could go on and on. Sure, APB gave me some of the best gaming moments I've had. Sweet bloody victory ripped from the jaws of a thousand snarling hellhounds, friendships forged in the hottest flames known to man, hatred so pure it would make a sith lord weep. The underlying mechanics are what I search for now in other online shooters, and the customization is still unmatched to this day. But all that said, let this poor old dog die. You will be fondly remembered for what you were.  RIP APB
21	0	a	'Oh yeah, the engine version update will happen soon.' ~2014 'Yeah, don't worry, soon.' ~2016  tl;dr -p2w -low population -tryhards and hackers -toxic community -lots of lag  Current state is pretty bad. Very addictive, but at the same time very bad. Devs seem to pump out more virtual things (microtransaction things, not free) than fixes to problems. Recently many legitimate players have been getting banned for 'harrassment', and the overall active-player count has been falling. Items are insanely overpriced ($40 for a permanent virtual weapon? Come on, now), and new players usually don't stand a chance against 'hardened' veteran players. Community is pretty toxic for the most part, and the game seems to be more frustrating than fun to play. Hackers are also common.
22	0	a	 APB Reloaded Review
23	0	a	To summarise before I begin: No.  The game cannot stand from the bloody, mangled mess it is in now.   A small player base which consists primarily of people with similar gametime to mine steal all the fun and prevent new players from being properly introduced to the game. The reason being that new players have almost no chance of beating a good, long-term player and are forced to fight against them because of the small amount of new players and poor matchmaking.   Many people complain about an 'abundance' of hackers, I believe it is simply players that are too fast and familiar with the game for newbies. Doesn't mean it will be a good, fun or balanced experience though.  The gunplay is very fast and unbalanced and requires an itchy trigger finger, high situational awareness and map familiarity to win, so be warned, shooter conservationists.  The new weapons that are being released are typically only able to be purchased with real money. (You're talking $30 to $50 for a permanent, account-wide weapon.) These weapons are considered Pay-2-Win, although I find that every weapon is bad, until it is placed into the right hands. Especially shotguns.  I believe the game only shines through it's beautiful customisation, allowing players to create amazing, intricate articles of clothing, cars and player models. People's creations in the game could even be seen as a form of art.   However, despite this feature's potential, it simply asks too much from the real-life financial standpoint. Free-To-Play players are restricted to very small amounts of customisation and even people that spend stacks of cash on the game are forced to simplify their creations for inevitable reasons like hardware constraints and server storage limits.  I do not recommend this game at all, unless you have LOTS of cash to splash and/or are feeling compelled to play it for whatever reason... You have been warned.

25	0	a	Review by a Long term Veteran of this game. From RTW(Retail, which I picked up at around July 2010) to Now and later.  (Excuse typo errors and any strange sentence combinations, fast typing and letters get mixed here and there and I really don't care enough after typing all of it to fix things) Deal with the fact I put a lot of time in the game, it just means my information is more backed then others.(oh man I'm boasting about it, now I'm uncredible)  Here we go.  Freemium! This game is heavily dependant on you paying for Premium to experience anything good, not like there's much to experience good cause really the only good thing about this game is the customization, but you need to unlock symbols (random mission reward that gets fewer and fewer the more you have) and the tutorial is terrible might I add so you'll get a lot of people making the experience that much more unpleasant.  Armas is a mess of Limited Time items(as of this review), far too many that it's laughable of how much content is limited time only and just recycled to fill in voids of no new content. With the new dev people, it seems that content is more frequent at points, but how long that can last till they just sit around and bank it up with limited time offers and resells? Who can say? It's all Pay for crap anyway, including items already in the game when it sank back in Retail like, goggles, desert scarfs and some others. The Uniform Jacket(Javez wears it and he's a criminal so there's no excuse) is still ENFORCER restricted for no good reason.  Server Performance(Not Client Framerate) Holy crap, the amount of problems you'll face is ridiculous, even the newer server hardware they're using isn't good at all for this type of game, you'll experience inconsistent handling with your car (due to handling being server side. Any spike, you will feel it and see cars smash into walls, people unable to control them as they exclaim in District chat 'Jesus take the wheel'. The amount of hitreg issues you'll face(taking into account IT IS hitscan, the ol I aim at this and the shot is instant) the slightest amount of spread on your weapon can really screw you over from how wonky the game takes the your information. You'll face many inconsistencies in fire fights that accuracy is blatantly thrown out the window witbh the issues and you're better off squeezing. **You'll see people using HVR Scouts and jump shotting with it (Pin point accuracy while doing so) to avoid certain problems with how bad detection can be.** They removed jumpshotting apparently from  vanilla  scouts.  Most people you will come to find out, will use full auto weapons(OCA, ACES, PMG, NTEC/CR5, Stock STARs and whatever new dumb gun there is) just to beat the awful hitscan system by firing as much as possible and not having the issues of shot registrations and bad bloom math from the game (ghost shots and magical bullets not hitting) I'll stop it there cause it's the biggest problem in the game(cause you're gonna have to deal with it to progress) and there's far too much to talk about relating to it but you can figure it out.  Framerate It's pretty on and off cause it's a bad version nof the Unreal Engine, your frames can drop for no reason so I'd suggest a FPS config even with decent hardware cause this game spits on it while not looking at all decent. They got rid of the pristine texture quality from RTW and a lot of the bloom to amke the game look more lively, to help 'performance'(I'm just gonna assume server load cause it hasn't done â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥) AND lessen game size (which who the hell cares about 4-8 extra GBs anymore? There's games that are larger then this game and have less content in the grander scheme. More excuses.)  Gun Balance Gun Superiority here is a big thing, expect to see the same weapons over and over dominating. Full autos and high damage weapons rule over others and that's that, there's nothing interesting to the weapons at all, they all feel terrible(bad sounds, generic recoil) and with the server performance it's just not fun playing at all when you feel like you're hitting people with marshmallows, and you're gonna have to do a lot of things in action districts just to enjoy the best side to it which is..  ~Customization~ It's great but not without it's own issues. Certain features aren't there like snaping angles and what not so you're gonna be moving your mouse slightly back and forth to get that perfect position as well as ugly jagged outlines and darkened ones making masking over things difficult if you aren't using black to mask over brighter colors on a black background. (Makes sense when you start doing it, don't worry about how I tried to word it, you'll find out if you get into it) Texture projection is really bad, certain items can just cut off something on your shirt when overlaying it, causing ugly outlines. (Wearing a blazer/bomber jacket over a designed shirt) You HAVE to have Premium to enjoy customization cause there is a lot of restrictions if you want to make your own things. Use to be 5 layers free on clothing, and in CB they changed it to 3. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ knows why. Tattoos are buggy, very...very... buggy. Some randomly duplicating, disappearing or just not layering properly. It's a nightmare once you're over 30 tattoos out of 50. You'll remove a tattoo, but it'll really remove something COMPLETELY different when you leave the kiosk, then you'll have to re-add it and it's just a never-ending nightmare, you'll have to do a lot of your tattoo designs in one go to avoid most issues if you start removing tattoos. You're gonna have to do missions to unlock most of the basic clothing you might like, and symbols (if you aren't buying them off armas.)  Armas Some weird â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up child of limited offers and high pricing. DO NOT buy weapons from Armas. NEVER do it, you can perform just as well with a stock weapon if you care enough to brave this game, and just to hopefulyl make them learn that pricing weapons that high(40-60 dollars sometimes) is stupid. Just stick to Premium, Clothes(they like doing stupid bundle â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, be wary that jacks the price up), and Cars if you are going to put money into this dying game  That's all I really wanna put down, I got a lot to put off my chest about this disappointing game that I thought was gonna be great back in 2010. Summary This game is terrible for a shooter, don't take it serious. Get points and if you lose, so what? You got standing and cash anyway, this isn't a game that has any rewarding skillful gameplay, you get your rewards and you progress to get what you want. Grindfest it up!  They tried to eliminate Idling the missions as much as possible, you'll have to do some work to get rewards, which means if you just get unlucky, and don't perform well, you might not even get anything cause that's how bad the system is.   The Community is a bunch of autism filled 4*channer kids who are all about the memes, that's all I really should put for those guys.  Have fun?... Or don't. I'll be in Social District for most of my APB time if I ever launch the game again.  I'd like to touch,  this is not a competitive shooter game . There are dumbasses actually doing clan scrims in a poorly done game. Team Fortress 2 deserves more of a competitive scene then this game.  TL;DR: Game isn't good and probably won't be further on. There's no direction in where it's going. Gun Play, grinding progression is not fun, and in which it's basically pushing you to buy Premium to even go at a decent pace, which late tier contracts are just insanely inflated and slow.  Example on Customization from a stream of me making someone an outfit -   Twitch is dumb and removes stuff that's months old.
26	0	a	I have played this game and witnessed its decline since Realtime World's Key to the City event. The game was, and still is, full of potential that is intentionally not being maximized by a lackluster, underexperienced dev team that is simply greedy.  The mechanics function purely to benefit the only few solid loadouts in the game, no matter how you play you will be forced to use certain loadouts if you wish to compete with other players of high skill. (I'd really enjoy seeing any of the majority of the community utilize something like an OSCAR vs a Joker, which does its job better 10fold, provided both players are excellent at the game.)  The community is full of vile â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Since APB's release, if you stream you can expect this to happen in this order. Stream &gt; Streamsniped &gt; DDoSed &gt; If you react, enjoy being stalked no matter where you go. The game hosts not only unscrupulous individuals, but also developers. Developers that would much rather help their friends rather than do something for the benefit of the game or talk to cheaters on steam on a regular basis. In the past, I can think of Neume claiming 'cheaters are customers' and resulting in another developer quitting. I can think of two developers that said the other employees did not foster a good working environment and had questionable design decisions. I can think of the fact that support replies to all tickets with scripted replies, you will not get a serious answer and if your ticket category is deemed questionable you can be replied to with something that is completely irrelevant to your ticket. That support team fostered older devs, such as Revoemag, or Jericho, who spoke to players directly and they became biased with how they handled those players and those players recieved special treatment.  The GMs the game has have always been questionable. There are a few videos of GMs running around using things such as invisibility during player missions, GM's banning players such as Sluttles and Argan and a few others for beating their friend in the arena mode, Fightclub who were then forced to go to support, which had no reply, and the only way to actually get them proper support was for the people receiving special treatment to bombard the developers with steam and forum PMs. This has happened many times, hell Shini recieved a 3-day ban for inquiring about an ARMAS purchase he didn't recieve so they could 'investigate his account'.  To prevent myself from going on any further, ill just sum up my issues with the game. Vile community Unsupportive producers and development team Questionable design decisions and lack of any truly produced content (95% of all the content they have released was content that was stripped from RTW's version of the game.) Poorly optimized Greedy producers and development team  Hell, this could go on for hours with examples and just listing SUMMARIES of my issues. I legitimately regret every hour I spent on this game and any smart player would quit and attempt to get their money back.  
27	0	a	As a high lvl Veterean (Rank 213), who played before it became APB Reloaded. I have had good and bad expereinces that you others players should know before you decide to try this shi tt yy game. I'm a vet who plays only with a few friends and we do not belong to any of those hacking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ d i ck clans. Will, lets get to the point. My friends and me aren't your typical COD players, We actually use common sense, strategy, map awareness, gaming headsets for max sound of invironments (footsteps, cars...), steam or skype chat for fast comm, and along with our legal macros from our gaming mouse and keyboards. Will we pretty much dominated when we can most of the time, but when we versus other high lvl players and major clans and beat them in missions. They become crybabies and accuse us of hacking. Then their also friends with the ((( GM/DEV ))) so getting your legit account banned is %100 possible. I spent over $100 on this game and now its nothing because of the currupt game system and player hating h o e s.   Pros -  -great game concept that I have ever experienced -Great costumization -great fire fights in 3rd person -great realtime strategy game to play with friends/family  Cons -  -broken spawn points -unbalanced team match up (2 above avrg. stat. gold players can be matched against 3 golds or lower rank players becoming a 2 vs 3-5) one sided missions -can't even get a match going nowadays unless you wait 5min plus  -currupt DEV / GM who plays with high lvl players, and they troll or are d i c k s to other players  -Most high lvl players rank 190 and up are hackers and if not, they hack their way up with immunity from the currupt DEV/GM to get there  -if you are a decent or good player who expresses great game abilities like shooting, knowing your surroundings, common sense, and more. You will automatically be qualified as a hacker to be banned. Evidence is (heresay most of the time with rarely the anti cheat picking you up)  -BAD GAMING Community  By now you should figure that I was banned for no reason other than jealousy so I stop playing. RIP (2011-2013)   I also went back to try it out late 2014, and became a gold at rank 17. I was already accuse of hacking by my opposition. We still lost a mission due to spawn point/ one sided missions. Then my own team mate whisper to me and was cursing at me, because we lost and he thought that I was hacking so there should be no reason for us to lose.   If you want, go for it and try this game out. I told you so...
28	0	a	To help you put things in perspective, I came from a VERY long hiatus. In fact, back then I played it outside of Steam before I did the 'change' over to Steam's installation. But now, in what I call a flurry of foolishness, I decided today to give the game another whack.  This is the point where you insert an audible 'sigh'.  APB: Reloaded, in it's early days, started off well enough. In fact, I'll go as far as to say I bought a shotgun from their Armas store (not even a great one...) which should be indicative of the hopes I had for it.  APB, simply put, pits you as either a Cop or a Crook. Crooks make money by commiting crimes such as crash-robbing store fronts, robbing pedestrians, doing missions... Well, their main source of income is mainly robbing storefronts. Crash a car in and get away with what pops out. Cops, well... All they can do is do missions or try and spot anyone committing a crime and then busting their chops for it. Any loot is returned to the evidence locker, which basically is as imbalanced as it sounds in terms of methods of profit.  In it's base concept, this sounds like a great idea for a game. The execution is fairly okay too, but there are some snags and other things that collectively ruin the game as a whole.  - I'm just going to kick in the door with the biggest sin: GamersFirst has a serious pest problem, in the shape of so-called 'Hackers'. Calling it Aimbotting is probably specific enough and self-explanatory. It was a pest when I left, and it was a pest within the first ten minutes of actual combat when I came back.  There's always going to be that controversial argument of 'maybe they're just really that good'. This might be a viable stance to take. But mind you, I've endured Aimbotting for an extended period in APB before I finally said goodbye to it. These Aimbotters may attempt to 'simulate' some more realistic response times. But let me tell you this: Back in those earlier days, I had someone admit he was using an Aimbot hack, which gave me a solid benchmark that allowed me to compare my previous experiences.  I have gotten a very solid impression of it, as well as an expertise to recognize Aimbotting and there was no doubt in my mind that in the brief period I played again, I was being subjected to it. GamersFirst has always claimed to come down hard on these things. But if they can't solve this problem within the two years that I left, then they seriously need to rethink of using a different anti-hack shield. Because it's the same one, and it really isn't working out for them. At this point, I even wonder if G1 cares anymore.  - The second controversial topic is the well-worn Pay-2-Win one. Funnily enough, if this game sins to this, it might be to a minor but still existing level. The Armas store has a range of special (and expensive) weapons for sale that for the most part have an improvement or exceptional trait over their regular counterpart. At first glance, these improvements seem minor. But when you get to know the 'standard' weapons, you'll understand that the improved version actually greatly counteracts the shortcomings the regular weapon has. For example, the SMG is a pretty great weapon that is only halted by it's short range. The equivalent that you can find in the Armas store has extended range. The changes are subtle and you won't really notice them until you are familiar with the weapon and have bothered to put 'two and two together'.  Not to mention that the Vehicles generally are very souped up in speed (even with a lot of weight in the car) and have either a series of useful mods installed or all mod slots unlocked. Either of which would require you to spend ginormous amounts of in-game currency AND level your character near maximum. If already possible with some vehicles.  - The 'normal' weaponry is a bit of a nuisance itself. More primarily in the way that you 'own' these. Now, APB isn't the first to 'rent' their guns and certainly won't be the last. But so far, this game is the only one that insists on only renting these for a set period of 10 days. No more, no less. You can't rent it for one day, or for one month. The only upside is that, in case of a rented weapon that has mods slotted in, you can simply 're-rent' it. Certainly isn't a redeeming factor, though.  - When it comes to missions, they will seem fine to the naked eye. Every 'mission' has a certain structure of stages to it. But the weakness in these lies in it's exploitations. There are two big examples of this.  Some missions end with a 'tug of war'. Everyone's position will show up in the HUD, and you need to constantly kill the opposing team's members to advance your 'pull'. Sadly, what has become common practise is that one team gets the advantage of even just 1 point, and then flees altogether. Going far enough so there is no way the opposing team can catch up and try and even the score. Allowing the aforementioned team to win by time-out. This is an extremely cheap way to gain victory and sadly has been practised by both Cops and Crooks. Especially since... well, if they'll do it, why shouldn't you?  The VIP ending is a touch worse. One member of one team becomes the 'VIP', which the opposing team has to assassinate. What common practice has become here is that there are set locations on the map where you can perfectly bunker down or 'camp' where the VIP can hide and all the defending team members have perfect defensive locations. Making it an impossible task for the opposing team to win.  These are exploits that have been around for quite some time. And while I skimmed the changelog of APB's update blog, I have no reason to believe this has changed. GamersFirst does not have a reputation of listening to it's playerbase.  - And as a final complaint... the fact that there's a serious lack of new content. The only difference I saw between now and two years ago is that every weapon now has a set of unlockable or purchaseable 'skins'. In fact, one of the other changes is a detriment. The 'Fight Club' serves are now locked to certain requirements, such as achieving rank in this and that. Funnily enough, I actually achieved these ranks long before I left APB, but apparently the game does not consider these as valid any more.   The bottom line is, APB is an IP that was bought over by GamersFirst to be turned into APB: Reloaded. It became Free To Play, but in return became a straight cash in through it's cash shop. Everything ties in with laying down more cash. Why just spend money in the Armas store if you can get a discount for being Premium? Why rent guns with in game currency if you can permanently have them for the price of three Indy Game titles!? (yes, the earlier mentioned shotgun actually set me back 12 Euros. The prices may have changed now, but that doesn't change much)  GamersFirst has one heck of a PR Team to make us believe that they are still actively developing this game and making significant updates. But realistically speaking, all this game updates anymore is the guarantee the Armas store works and you are still encouraged to buy some Premium time.  Please, I ask you: Don't play this game for a serious experience. And if you still play it, be it to have some stupid fun with friends (which is a perfectly viable reason), then don't purchase anything from the Cash Shop. The prices don't add up to what you'll receive, and it only helps fund this atrocity of a business plan behind this game.  If anything, it's slow death should only be hastened. Another great game, ruined by corporate greed and short-sightedness.
29	0	a	Well, it was so nice to start this game at the beginning couple of years ago (I don't play on steam, i just prefer to play from GamersFirst launcher. I've got over 400 hours on APB.), It was, really. A lot of helpful players that can make you really happy. I had a pretty good clan when i started. I was having so much fun. They were really making a game that worths every single hour in the game. For a year I wasn't able to play the game. For a year i waited to play this game again and after some time I went back to game. A LOT of stuff changed for me. The new threat system, new fight clubs map, bounties, a lot of new weapons, new cars... At first I really liked it again. But after some time i realised that if you don't give tons of money to game to play properly, you can't have fun with this game..   Bad things after the change: -Good palyers have become â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, (I've spent enough time to understand who is good and bad. There is no such thing as good (by good i'm trying to say helpful) player anymore...) -The currency of the game is not apb dollars, it's just the real money itself (So sad to think that i have donated over $50 to this game..) -The developers are just greedy people, (They make a weapon that you can only buy with real money in every patch...) -The potential of the game is just perfect but they really ruined it over the last year.. -Oh, I forgot the terrible matchmaking system. If you don't get rekt (i couldn't even say wrecked, it's THAT bad.) by couple of guys with the best weapons and with the highest ranks, you are one lucky guy..  Good thing i can still say: -One word: Customization. It's like you are playing The Sims with guns! It's awesome to create yourselves that you want to be deep down in your heart. -Graphics are not important most of the time, but i have to say this game was one of the best visual game of his time. They are still good but there is a collection of 'Next Gen Games' now. But still, i really like the visuals of the game.  There are still things that i can tell (Most of them are negative), but at the first sight you can see these ones. My overall rating to this game is 4.5-5/10, BUT if the developers ever listen to our complains to the game just once, this game can go up to 10 out of 10 by arranging APB to a free game(It's not just that, by polishing the bugs, removing the half of the population of the game(I'm talking about cheaters of course...etc.), even it's close to impossible. If they do that my feelings can get back the way it used to be.
30	0	a	After putting in a little over 70 hours into this game, I believe I can finally review it.  Pros: -Customization is fantastic in this game, regardless if its clothes or guns, you can change very small details to make your character  feel  your own. -As what on the outside looks like a generic Cops n' Robbers game, it actually is much deeper than just run and gun missions. There's a story behind each contact, and the relationships between the contacts begin to form as you rise through the ranks. -The weapons and clothing (no armor, per say) really do set you in the mood of a city that breeds anarchy and violence. It's depicted so well on the criminal's gear, wild and more punk looking. The Enforcers however, look very rough and beaten, but very strong.  Cons: -Connectivity issues are a huge problem when it comes to their servers. Regardless of what computer you're on, you still seem to lag out and drive right into a wall, or run right into a room full of baddies. Eventually coming back to full connection dead and respawning. -Hackers. Oh my. Hackers. There are times when they get confused with people who pay to win, but I'll get to that. There are massive ban waves that the moderators do to wipe all hackers that they detect. However, it's an IP ban, which means simply changing your IP address will let you back in. I believe it's the three strike rule, and then your character is deleted from that game. Regardless, for every one good player there are two hackers, and they usually farm kills on low-level servers. -The leveling system (Reputation/Threat). This system is flawed, I believe, as when you start out you get a letter 'T' next to your name. This stands for Trainee, and that's where it ends. There is no closed tutorial, as you are learning from a menu that tells you what to do in the active game. No training wheels, kiddies, because you could go into matchmaking as a trainee and get paired against a gold or two, and be completely destroyed. This wouldn't be as frustrating as it is, if the system wouldn't go by threat level. It doesn't detect threat level until after 5-10 matches of pure hell and dying, which is what usually drives people away. -Pay to Win. Finally, we're here. Considering this game is F2P, I was overjoyed when I first entered. I looked past my many starting matches and hoped that I would eventually find something that I could latch onto and love...I was wrong. The guns and outfits for normal players are nice, and take a while to get (A while is doing repetitive missions for the same contact until you unlock that tier), buying from the ARMAS Marketplace is 10x better. I played for 40 hours normal, and I was struggling at best on a Bronze server. Bronze. Only a step up from Green when are literally entering servers. I have a fully decked out character after spending $40 in the marketplace because everything is so overpriced. Overpriced weapons for overpowered players.  I really wish I could reccomend, but finally, I cannot because of the frustrating issues that this game not only displays as 'learning the ropes and playing with a great community' but disagrees and actually begins to kick new players from parties who say anything bad about the community or the game.
31	0	a	As you can see I played this game for quite a while, thouh I can not recommend anyone to try it out. I played this game with a very casual attitude but over time it becomes less and less fun for several reasons  The biggest reason of this is a mixture of bad game design and the community. Often enough you just see players abusing every aspect of the game to get an advantage. Some of them can be very hostile and unfriendly as well.  The biggest problem in terms of the game itself is the matchmaking. People are seperated into 4 different threat Levels, Gold, Silver, Bronze and Green. There are several instances for each threat level to play in. Each threat level is allowed to go into instances one level below their own level which results in the fact that Gold instances are almost always empty, becasue all gold players decide to go to the silver instances.   The distribution of threat levels is set so that the top 20% of players are given the gold status, but becasue inactive accounts aren't taken out of the equation (which means that every silver that quits this game out of frustration is still counted towards the silver group) it rather feels like 70% of people are gold, menaning the being a gold status is easy to achieve.  This results in the fact that average and casual players that turn gold are deemed to play against the super pros in this game a lot of times, giving them an experience of this game that is not fun at all. I might seem to you like a good player when you look at the time I played, but I was mostly on the border between silver and gold, meaning that as long as I play in silver instances I have to play a lot against people I don't stand much chances against. Since it is not that obvious for new silver players how enter a bronze instance they will most likely end up being put in the silver districts as well and end up being farmed a lot.  With this game being free to play there's not much wrong with giving it a try, but don't expect too much of a pleasant experience. I seems like a game with a lot of potential, but doesn't live up to much of it.
32	0	a	 Mission objective: Pick-up briefcase and hold it for as long as you can   Three other players and I jump into a car and race for the pick-up location. We are just one corner shy of the destination, when an RPG comes flying in out of nowhere and sends us all into oblivion. The camera pans to a female player that looks like she just finished filming a scene for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.  One team member and I spawn at a nearbly location and rush towards the briefcase, which is now being held by gentleman sporting a trendy mohawk, sprinting through the narrow back alleys. We hide behind a wall and wait for the enemy to come closer. Suddenly, my co-player gets annihilated by a sniper, hiding anywhere between two blocks and half a lightyear away. Knowing that I am about to get killed in any moment, I jump into the alley and start spraying the gentleman with bullets. By the time I'm halfway through my magazine, he had already dropped the valuable cargo and started firing towards me. Two deadly shots after that and my lifeless body drops to the ground.  At that point, I see that my two other team-mates arrived with a windowless van, that looked like it belonged to somebody who likes to attract children's attention with candy. The copilot was hanging out the window and before he even got the chance to showcase his rat-a-tat maker, he got eliminated by the same marksman that showed his hunting prowess just moments before I died. The driver managed to leap out of the van, but got mowed down by a machine gun faster than a teenage COD player insults your mother.  We respawned shortly after that and by then, the briefcase was already traveling down a highway. I managed to talk a lovely lady into lending me her beige SUV and my crew jumped inside. The race for pride, honor and briefcase holding privilege had begun. I ran all the red lights on the way, nothing could stop my determination. I even handbraked into a couple of corners and pulled some wild powerslides through them, in a way that would put Sebastien Ogier to shame, all in hopes to catch up with our opponents as quickly as possible. Two kilometers and three squashed pedestrians later, we are on the tail of a menacingly looking vehicle one could only describe as a weird mishap between a Hummer and a soccer-mom's minivan.  My passengers all stuck themselves through the windows and opened fire on the vehicle in front of us. Unfortunately, the passengers of the car in front of us also decided to do the same thing and bullets were now flying towards our car. I started swerving like a mad man, trying to recall moves from Ken Block's latest Gymkhana video, but two of my passengers had already died. I figured the car was already way beyond repair and that there was no way I could ever return it to its owner in this shape, so I decided to go for broke and attempted to ram the car, hoping that it would spin out. I didn't even manage to get near it, when a huge flame burst out of my engine compartment and just moments after that, the car exploded. My buddy and I were burnt to a crisp and we had to start all over again.  The two team-mates that died first had already managed to secure a van and were honking the horn, trying to get us to enter the van. I told the three of them to go ahead, while I went to switch firearms.  Just as I was leaving the police station, I saw a huge truck stopped at an intersection. Thinking that was probably my best chance at doing anything, I hopped in and slowly but surely pulled away. I was driving in the general direction of the briefcase and was picking up speed. Three blocks after that, I was approaching an intersection at a blistering speed and sheer luck had it that the Hummer minivan just came racing through that said intersection and slammed head on into my truck. The truck had no intention of stopping whatsoever and the incredible amount of inertia started shoving the awful looking vehicle towards a building. Nothing could stop the brute force of my truck smashing the car into the wall, crushing it like a car compactor on steroids. The vehicle exploded and a majestic fireball engulfed the remains of the opposing team.  People came from near and far, cheering as I jumped out of the truck and picked up the briefcase. My team arrived just in time, so I hopped into the van and we drove off, ever so slowly. One wouldn't think, but the van really seemed to struggle hauling the extra weight of the briefcase, even if it seemed to be so light when I was carrying it just moments ago. My team complimented me on my spectacular display of driving skills and before I could respond, the unthinkable happened.  An RPG struck the van. And you guessed it, it was Sasha Grey again. I managed to hold the briefcase for twenty whole seconds before it got abruptly taken away again. I watched Sasha walk up to the briefcase and, just before picking it up, whisper: 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ n00b fa*gots'.  Needless to say, we lost that match. I never played ABP after that and to this day, I still question my sexuality due to Sasha's deep words.
33	0	a	After playing this game extensively for a time,  APB is not in the slightest new player friendly in both mechanical and playerbase aspects. The playerbase is full of venomous, toxic people. Should you get involved with the community, you can expect DDoSers, griefers and undesirable people to bother you.  Mechanically speaking, APB does not in any way play like any other shooter. Many people will pick up an assault rifle, press right mouse and hold down the trigger, which rarely works. The gunplay sits solely around extremes, there are no in-betweens like in most shooters, which I personally find silly. Only shotguns and SMGs will be found in close quarters. Only snipers, semi-autos and (sometimes) assault rifles will be found in long range. You have to frequently change guns depending on the environment, which can be an extreme problem if you don't have premium, because there is a lengthy cooldown for the ammo box which can be used for changing guns and re-stocking. The only way to negate that long cooldown is to own premium.  The matchmaking is also hopelessly broken, and veterans will be placed against new players.  APB also suffers from a item shop dilemma. There are certain guns that are extremely potent, which can only be purchased via the armas market. Originally, you could outgun the OCA whisper or the CSG, but now there are pocket SMG guns, such as the Oca Nano, the extremely high ROF SMG that can be used like a rifle that is the ACES gun, so on and so forth. They aggressively market their items and don't even attempt to make a F2P variant that can compare.  The Developers are not only ridiculously greedy, but they also lack any talent. Most content is re-hashed or has minimum effort applied to it. Bug fixes are slow to happen. They've done nothing to fix the rampaging numbers of cheaters which have plagued the game since beta, aside from occasionally catch someone who's too blatant, or false ban someone who may be godly good at the game. On the subject of bans, a developer has come out and flatly said that all bans are final and that they are cheaters, no matter what.  The only redeeming qualities I could even offer is that the customization is unmatched, the vehicle play is a fascinating idea and the open world missions are a great idea, but could certainly use a lot of tweaks at later level missions.  I personally believe it may be too late to save APB, and that it should be sold to another company so that the customization can be harvested for a much better game.    
34	0	a	Pros:  -Best character customization in any game -Many cars -100 people districts -Fight clubs for constant action  Cons:  -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ load of hackers/Triggerbotters -Heavily pay-to-get worthy things but not necessarily pay to win because most ARMAS guns are reskins -Bad graphics -Bad optimization -Matchmaking is garbage -Big health pools that favor central europeans mostly when it comes to ping so they kill you fast even if you hit them first and with more bullets -Small development team and a very greedy one. They do not even have an animator even though they made millions through ARMAS -Not new content since 2011 -Not solo-friendly -Not really a way to make big profits other than being a talented designer. -Silvers must play with golds because of the ridiculously low population -Combat is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, hit the head or the legs, same thing. -Not really any new content announced for the future 
35	0	a	Wow, I cannot begin to fathom how a game with such a great concept can get it so wrong in every way. Who doesn't want to be on either side of the law, battling the other side in a fast paced action game? No matter how hard you try to like this game, it will push you back with poor performance, game breaking bugs, repetitive and uninteresting missions and extremely unbalanced matches. If you are not planning to put money into this game, do not bother wasting your Hard Drive space and time with this game. This is the most pay2win game I have seen in a long time. And, speaking of money, the prices of the items are insane, with $5 getting you 400GC. If you want to buy a vehicle to keep, while on special, it is 3000GC. Think about that.  This game is probably one of the worst executed games I have ever seen. If you are prepared to fork out a fair sum of money, and put up with laggy servers and a plentiful amount of hackers, your crazy. If you still proceed to download and play this game, you must enjoy self-harm.  Avoid this game AT ALL COSTS
36	0	a	If you have enough money you can win at this game!   Yes you can unlock and buy weapons with ingame money too, but premium weapons are way too powerful. When you have low level starting gear and the matchmaking.............It's total b*llshit! You have to play with people who have bigger level and better weapons than you. The biggest problem is that this game has, is its unbalanced matchmaking and premium gear.  Edit: 14/5/2015  The community of this game is so toxic! The game is full of trolls, A*sholes and premium guys calling free to play players noobs.   Do yourself a favor, and don't install this if you don't want to pay for guns.
37	0	a	The game itself is fine, however the community is utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. And seeing as this game is online only you are forced to play with them so i think it's ok to downvote this game based on this alone. This games community is the worst i have come across so far. Download the game if you can put up with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s constantly or are in fact an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself and want to connect with other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s!   Worst community 2015.
38	0	a	I'm just gonna--BOOM! Died by rocket launcher!  Gonna hop in my car--BOOM! Died by rocket launcher!  I'm gonna give this game a positive revie--BOOM! Died by rocket launcher.  This game used to be good until all the 'BOOM! Died by rocket launcher' stuff.  1/10, too many rocket launcher booms.

40	0	a	APB 2012 Veteran with a level 255 gold enforcer and a 180-190 rank Crim. I know what I'm talking about. I have about 400 hours on my main steam account followed by about 1000-1200 on my G1 Launcher account. A good 400-500$ down the drain unfortunately   The Cons / Game Breakers / 90% of this game  - The worst matchmaking I have EVER seen in my life is ANY game. I've seen two silvers ( noobs ) with probably about 50 hours combined with a gold with maybe 70-90 hours at most ( At most, 190 hours combined ) go against 3 golds with over 8000 hours combined. I'm just speechless.  - Cancerous community. The most common type of cancer among the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of San Paro is no doubt griefers  ' The best way to avoid the cancer is to become the cancer ' - a fellow anonymous San Paro enforcer  - The last 15 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing updates taking place once a month have been Joker Boxes or an Arma$$ marketplace update  - I wouldn't mind spending 1-5$ for a gun reskin, 10$ at most for a super cool gun skin.. but they're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 40$ FOR ONE. EVERYTHING on the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in marketplace is overpriced. Admitedly they ARE cool though. It gets quite annoying when the last 15 updates in a row have been simply paid 40$ reskins of guns.  - Corrupt developers. Proof :         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Revoemag the corrupt GM&nbsp;
41	0	a	I spent way to much time and money on this game for nothing. Constant cheaters. The creators promised improvements such as an engine update. They have yet to bring updates. They only create new weapons trying to bring in money
42	0	a	Played this game for a few hours. Stinks worse than hot garbage on a summers day..
43	0	a	You don't want to play this game. I had typed out a long review, but Steam decided to discard it, so let me summarize:  Bad matchmaker. Low level players instantly against high level ones, over and over again, and level makes a difference in this game, both in skill and gear. Buggy gameplay, with bad shooting mechanics based around spread AND recoil, with few guns being able to perform more than one singular task. Horrible players who alternate between hacking, griefing, and acting like total tools to the rest of the community. And a game company managing it who doesn't know what the word manage means. Literally has let the game get worse and lag more and more over the past year and a half. If you must play this game, do not pay for anything, there is no reason to, and it's just as likely the game will die in the next year, flushing your money down the drain.
44	0	a	APB: Reloaded has gone downhill significantly since it's Free-to-Play release. While it still retains a good feeling for the gunplay mechanics, the prevelance and overzealous pushing of the cash shop along with annoying players with 'subscribe now!' advertisements tends to get in the way.  Over time weapons have been tuned in such a way that significant advantages (especially in lower threat levels and ranks) are outright purchasable with real cash, and these aren't cheap. Permanent weapons can cost upwards of a full $40 if not more, but at least now they're able to be applied to all characters on an account for a premium.  Cheating is a very common problem these days, be it via hacks or gaming the threat/matchmaking system. With no real appropriate ladder, and the overwhelming amount of people who feel that if they aren't winning they aren't having fun; we find that more and more players will use every and any trick in the book and out of the book to win with illegitimate results.  If you can get over those issues though, and play APB:R without too much invested in it with a few friends, you can have an absolute blast be it chasing down criminal players or resisting arrest from enforcers.  The question here is whether or not APB:R is good enough to warrant still being alive, and that's a debatable answer.
45	0	a	A joke of a game, when all is said and done about the game.  The game offers a lot that many other games do not, meaning it's near endless levels of customization from your character, to your vehicles and your weapon (albeit pre-made skins upon your weapon.) The gun game, whilst often subject to horrid servers is satisfying, regardless of it's Call of Duty-like TTK (Time To Kill) meaning that most fire-fights will be over very swiftly. The game suffers from a plethora of issues however, and many of them are game-breaking.  There is a heavy influence of cheaters in the game, and they are not removed appropriately quickly due to the anti-cheat measures put into the game prioritizing microtransactions from the cheaters instead of increasing the quality of the game by banning them as quickly as possible - which is a very shady practice seeing how it's a lose-lose situation.  The community is probably the most toxic and vile you can find. I have never seen such a hateful community anywhere else which directly affects gameplay as you will find many people griefing your mission and other missions just for the fun of it for them. This is also why it is almost impossible to stream this game and have a remote amount of viewers, as many will target you for griefing.  The development behind the game is barely there, and they also do very shady practices. They falsely ban players with zero evidence of them cheating or the like, or simply ban them because they receive too many reports about the players without checking into their playstyle and seeing if they are good, or cheaters. GMs are non-existant, they are very few and very rarely around - even when they display themselves, they hardly do anything against blatant cheaters.  The development team has zero clue about the metagame, what should be fixed and what should not be fixed, along with pretending some things are not an issue - server issues being a particular subject they prefer to avoid.   If you have a severe case of masochism, it is worth trying out. I have played it for many hours, and I have an entire channel dedicated to the game on YouTube. If you want a game that is as new player hostile as Dwarf Fortress without one ounce of it's depth, this is it. This game breaks friendships faster than Mario Party 2.  If you want to play a third person shooter that's free to play and something to just calm down to, I would probably keep looking elsewhere.
46	0	a	The #1 worst thing about this game isn't the devs, it isn't the cheaters, it isn't the performance. It's the community.

48	0	a	Four long years ago, when i first started playing, i wrote a review, basically saying this game will find what is wrong with your computer and profusely let you know about it. To this day i still use this game to iron out driver kinks and test hardware for faults. No clue why, but this game seems to be the best at letting you know whether or not your computer is worth its weight. Still does too.  For now, i'm going to speak more into the game, more in depth on the content and world of APB:R, and its affects to real life issues.  The game is beautiful, and has so much potential, the world is still caughing up silly little secrets and jokes that even the most seasoned vet of the title has yet to discover. There was a mobile app built that lasted roughly through beta, died out from the toxicity of the community, even though the community had actually asked for it. If the players were more in tune to the forum than reactive to it, maybe some benefit could come of the game, instead we have vet players remaining silent as the community of fresh meat green horns play the game for a day and shape the future by speaking out on the forums. There is a huge lack of communications, and slim to no community outreach program. The changes made to the game that the vet players seem to dislike come from those who really do not know how to play the game in the first place. OR, from those with computers that can't properly handle the game process. I saw one person in the forum claim his Intel Pentium Dual Core was 'Gaming grade' unfortuneatly, this is what we have to look forward to in the title that is APB:R. Computer illiterate noobs, players who take the mentality of 'be what you cannot be' too seriously, and a development staff just as toxic, though, not at all in the same way, the devs are just silent.  People don't realize how destructive silence really is, sure you can /ignore you're way through the community, but you're being no better than the person opening their mouth and showing how unintelligent they really are.  The game itself is a hacker, many people claim he/she is a hacker, but from what i've seen (and being called an aimbotter myself) the game is the hacker. The one thing that really rubs my fur the absolutely wrong way, hit detection. The devs really broke the game trying to fix that for the noob players who claimed they hit someone when they really shot the vending machine, in the building next door... they have such terrible aim, and no weapon control. So the devs went and reworked hit detection, well guess what... now the game lags out every single time a bullet comes near an opponent (op) the frames drop, and the game registers a few hits, but since it lagged so hard the gun only fired 3 rounds, and the op decides to take advantage of this and shoots back. The game has really become a mexican standoff for each mission, when i started playing there was such a thing as 'Spray n pray' or 'all out balls to the wall firefights' now, well now it's just depressing.  The game itself is the hacker... This has lead me to assume that many players i've opposed were the hackers, which then in turn lead to my anger generation going sky high. I have a roommate who refuses to speak to me or even be near me when i'm playing APB:R, i have a few friends online who cannot play the game anymore because of how angry they get. Honestly speaking, i too have stopped playing the game due to the anger problem, and the level neglect the development team has given the game. Seriously, i would not be phased if they shut down the game for the new engine to be completed and start up the game then!  The silence i spoke of earlier, and the neglect, and the game itself being the hacker... This can all be fixed simply by disconnecting the power cord to their servers, focus on building the new engine and console version, then merging the account's content into the new engine, and voila! new engine released, community was kept up to date, and the devs weren't split over 9000 ways. However, that would make sense, and as i've seen the devs don't listen to logic, they do their own special way of thinking, which is 'take on the hardest, largest workload and pick highly unrealistic due dates, then completely ignore the dwindling community.' I've spent a couple hundred bucks on this game, i know others have too, there is NO shortage of funds preventing them from getting the job done, and their last post from a year ago made sense, true, it would take more time to hire someone new to aid in the development to train them on what does what, but honestly, i competent coder can see what the code is, what you want and make it happen. Without complex tutorials teaching the guy how to code, without having to hold their hand, with a competent new hire coder, you give him a task, a due date, and you can bet that guy will bust his butt to make that due date, cuz he's the new guy, he's fired if he fails. I'm not sure how that works when the boss has been so lax in the due dates for the game now, seeing as there is roughly just 5 people (claimed) to the company working on APB:R (and who knows what else from G1) they have devs taking vacations, devs spending company time playing the game on twitch.tv (effectively extending the new engine upgrade that much longer)  The company that handles APB:R aka 'Reloaded Productions' or RP for short, is in a serious structure reworking. They've become complacent in their duties, deadlines, and ability.  The base game though... The game itself in a PvE perspective... as in, character customizations, customizations in general, and general concept, is absolutely perfect. And when GTA:V launched it was BETTER than GTA:V by a long shot! Though multiplayer wasn't really a GTA thing, it was modded into GTA:SA, which sparked the GTA:IV online aspect, which gave birth to GTA:O a concept that Rockstar Games didn't research on enough and flopped at launch, but they have since fixed it and so on... Now if only RP can learn from Rockstar Games (RG) what it means to 'fix' something. I cannot stress this enough... The devs at RP need to shut down APB:R and focus on the game engine only, fix that and start it up asap without split priorities, and THEN you can milk the dry cow for more money, or get a new cow and guarantee that milk will come.  This game currently has too many issues, and a super slow dev team, with an incompetent management system. Are you interested in playing the game? Wait, just wait. Do i recomment you play the game? Right now? god no, just wait until they launch the new engine. Is this game worth it? So long as the toxic community further poisons the minds of the Devs into ruining the game, no, not at all is this game worth a dime, the devs and managing staff need to learn who to listen to, before they make changes at all.
49	0	a	My old review got taken down by the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ devs, so here it is. Got a new PC a few months ago, wanted to try out the game that I once adored with my good friend Bassdrop. I can't say that I am surprised, but once again the game is a dissapointment. If theres anything interesting, it's how much real money you can spend at the armas marketplace before going homeless. This game is a cash grab, plain and simple. You will not enjoy this game without spending atleast $100 and a $800+ PC because this game runs on an old â™¥â™¥â™¥ Unreal engine that is outdated to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and you will never get above 40fps constant. In addition to that, you get amazing stuttering which is always fun especially when P2W users can buy the tommy gun(high rate of fire, big mag) and you get sprayed down and you can't do anything about it because it rapes your cpu. Engine upgrade should be something to get excited about, as the developpers have been promising for the last 2-3 years. No. Don't get your hopes up. This game is trash, the developpers are trash and the game is simply a cash grab. So far, it is working well for the developpers, everyone is buying their pay to win weapons â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t and there hasn't been a single proper content update since 1 year. I wasted so much time on this game, I regret it. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't get into this game it will not turn out well for you.  Gamersfirst, Reloaded Productions, suck big fat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and get the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of here.

53	0	a	I know some of you are going to look at this and think, 2200 hours + and a negative recommendation, come on man, but please hear me out. I've been playing this game for a very long time now and have came to the ultimate conclusion that, yes, hackers rule all of APB, it 'IS' Pay 2 Win, and Gamers First will not do anything about it ever!  Now, here are the reasons:  1) Hackers are their primary source of income.  Need I say more?  Most of these guys that are hackers are little rich bleep nozzles who aren't good and instead of actually trying to get good, they buy hacks, and if I wasn't wiser, they're probably purchasing the hacks directly from the same people who run the freaking game.  I know this all sounds strange. But over the years I've played this, I've noticed so many hacks I didn't even know that many have existed. Walls, Aimbot, Lag Hacks, you name it, its in APB or has been.  And whats even funnier, oh ya'll are gonna love this.... The hacks seem to change out every couple of months or so. Its like they're on a subscription plan to hack! I have little doubt of that.  Now, if you throw money at this game, it helps you out dramatically. I use to think that, well, you can get these guns in the game with in game currency if you just play for long enough, but no... no, no, no, nooooo, this is not true. For example, you can buy an OCA with in game currency, however, if you use money to purchase an OCA Whisper, well, its about 3x better of a weapon from what I've experienced when using it.  I know some of you hackers, trolls, and others are going to downvote this, but w/e, it is what it is.  There are some things that make this game good, dont get me wrong. I think when it was first developed they had 'some' good intentions. I'm not sure how far those good intentions go however.  The good things about APB are, the customizations in the game are 2nd to none. Highly customize your car, your body, your clothes, even create songs and themes.  Another good thing is all the events that they hold. I really like that and I wish other games would do it more often. For example, they have a Halloween event, xmas event, and lots of others all throughout the year. Also they do special events. For instance, they just had an event where if you get so many kills a day, you unlock 20 Joker Mystery Boxes. It was cool.  Now, this is where the good things stop.  Ok, so one thing about the Joker Mystery Boxes, they hold special permenant weapons that you can unlock, however there is a slim chance of getting one. Actually, a way way way way way too slim of a chance of getting one. I unlocked 60 Joker Mystery Boxes and didnt get 1 permenant weapon. 60!  I feel bad for people who spend money on this game that dont hack honestly.  I feel bad for people who spend money on this game period. At least until Gamers First does something about the horrible hacking community they have in APB. Which, from the looks of things, they're never going to do anything about. Because like I said, refer to point 1) in the beginning of this review.  It all makes sense. They say, oh we implemented Fair Fight and that will take care of the hackers in APB. Yeah, well, Fair Fight only gets rid of the blatent hackers, the ones that skip all over the map... shoot a lot faster.... and get 30 kills and 0 deaths contantly. Problem is, theres so many more hackers that go undetected by Fair Fight, and most never get caught. And I'm guessing for good reasons too.  I really have had some good times in APB, but there's been way more bad times than good I can say. Mainly fighting the hackers. I just got out of APB and every match was against hackers, I mean come on, all I want is a decent match without hackers, is that so much to ask for?  One more thing, this game has lagging unlike any other. I'm not sure why, or how its possible that this is the 'ONLY GAME' that lags like this, but its really annoying. I sort of feel like the hacks have a big part to do with it honestly. I think the hacks are actually coded into the software itself and it compensates for them through lag to make up for the time.  Anyways.  If you're new, welcome to Hackworld. If you don't hack, I wouldn't even waste your time like I have unfortunately :(  Also, as a side note, the APB community is the absolute worst community I've ever experienced in the history of gaming. Absolute Worst!  All the legit players that I know wish and hope that this game will come around and that the hackers will be all gone and dealt with one day, but honestly, I just dont see that happening. They've made their choice. And instead of fixing that, they shove out more things for people to buy on the marketplace. Its disgusting really.  If they would just get rid of the hackers, this game could really shine and be a legitimately fun game that thousands of people would spend hours enjoying with their friends.  I'll continue to play this game until I get all the achievements, which isn't far from now, and also my criminal to 255, which is not far off. But after this, I won't be seeing much of this game anymore until Gamers First decides to actually do something about their disgusting community of hackers, trolls and the sorts.

54	0	a	Hey everyone,  first of all, don't mind how many hours Steam shows I have played because it is wrong. I played this game at least 300+ hours and have a 178 ranked character.  Now, I have started playing this game a few years ago and I have always had troubles with it.  It is a game you really want to love but you can't and I will tell you now why.   THE GOOD    + Character creation and customization  The game has an amazing character creation and plenty of customization options that I have yet to seen a better version in similar games.   + Cars  There are enough number of cars to keep the variety and they can be customized as well.   + Customization and personification  The game both in its character creation and car customization offers enough tools to create your own unique look in the game.   THE BAD    - Lack of new content  Since the time I started playing this game, it hasn't changed much at all.  It has basically only a few game modes that have stayed the way they are for a very very long time.   - The story  The game does have a story at the beginning but it is non-existant through out the rest of the game. Of course you can't expect a rich story from this kind of a game but since it doesn't have much else to offer, it could be nice to at least have a story.   - Server issues and lag  The game has been and still is barely playable with its sever issues and constant lags. It has suffered from these problems for a long period of time and unfortunately it doesn't get any better. This makes especially driving a horrible experience since they are server based.   - Premium membership and cash shop  The game suffers from unbalanced premium weapons which are overpowered compared to in-game weapons.   - Graphics   The graphics are not too bad and could be overlooked if the game had a solid gameplay and at its current state they look dated.   CONCLUSION   The game has a lot of potential but unfortunately it doesn't do muchto explore the possibilities both in its gameplay and story. Apart from having an excellent character creation and customization, the game unfortunately doesn't have very much to offer with its repetitive gameplay.
55	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. Horrible community rife with cheaters, bare bones, barely functional gameplay, and horrible business practices on part of the developer and publisher. This game makes me cry everytime I play it and yet I keep playing it - perhaps because I've invested so much money in it. The only fun I have anymore is with the music studio and recreating my favorite songs in it. This game has dried up and I strongly urge anyone who hasn't already tried it to avoid it. Just don't give yourself the headache that this game causes its players.
56	0	a	What Reloaded studios PROMISED everyone on the APB:Reloaded RETAIL BOX:  - Asylum District - Racing District - Clan Wars (aka turf wars)  This was to be delivered by the end of 2012. None of it happened.  We're now by the end of 2013 in all this time and what they actually delivered was:  - Fightclub (A deathmatch mode which is basically a rehash of already existing city parts but with boundaries so that you don't actually load the entire city which causes horrible performance issues) - Lucky box 1 LIMITED TIME ONLY!!! EXCLUSIVE!! BUY NOW!!! SALE!!!! (gambling real money for p2win items) - Lucky box 2 - Lucky box 3 - Lucky box 4 - Lucky box 5 - Lucky box 6 - Lucky box 7 - Lucky box 8 - Re-hued machinegun (grey to gold) skins for 15â‚¬  Also, they will try to sell you the idea that this game is not P2WIN, I'd say that's arguable... Boosters vs Grindfest, Nano vs... everything else.   Update: Make that... - Lucky Box 9, 10 and 11 now.
57	0	a	I wrote this because APB is a good game, but has bad developers and when it dies someone should buy the rights and make things the right way!  Pros: GTA pvp style game, Free to play, unique song system, unique customization system  Cons: Pay to win, Full of hackers, Own company sells the hacks, Admins nonexistent. When they exist they abuse and steal accounts or kick people (they rage), Low player base (more chance that you will encounter a hacker), Server rank system based on bronze/silver/gold. You eventually reach silver rank and are pitted against all the gold players which are 90% hackers. Gamersfirst decided it was a good thing to remake the main menu which was an art masterpiece and turn it into an ingame rendered still image, increasing loading times a thousandfold on top of looking bad. New players wont know what this is. Also changed the original game theme as well, destroying even more the style the game had. Meaning it has nothing to do with the game. (street art techno chill punk turned now into mistery low bass song more fit to X Files)    Now onto the good stuff!! why are you hating so much?   This is an old story originally from this post (I was banned by an APB developer from that forum and post deleted, gladly all of it is in this review!)  http://steamcommunity.com/app/113400/discussions/0/276237094319491421      Links to images and videos of the proof below the story, enjoy.      THE STORY, in short, rather long     Originally posted by  Garompa :
58	0	a	My relationship with APB: Reloaded has been like how an abused spouse comes back to her partner. You come back hoping everything has changed and the game has gotten better over the past year or so, but all in all it's still just a bad game deep down inside. Bad analogy? Let me explain why.  APB: Reloaded is fun but extremely hard to get into due to the fact that when you start out you get paired with people WELL beyond your skill level, and not even the tutorial city can prepare you for the assraping you recieve once you get into a real server. Going into a Bronze server? Prepare to get rekt by recently upthreated Golds and on-the-border upthreating Silvers as you get called a noob and eventually booted for not knowing what to do. Sure, Golds are banned from Bronze threat servers, but the only thing they have to do is de-threat to silver and it'll be no time before they start pounding your innocent virgin pucker back to submission. The thing that really shines in the game, however, is customization. You can customize your character to your hearts content to make them look like the baddest flipping cop or the finest looking criminal, but unfortunately that's where the positives really end. Missions are tedious 'capture the flag', 'hold the point', and 'team deathmatch' modes, weapons that are way too overpowered to be in the game are easilly obtained throughout the first few hours of the game, and 'pay to win' elements are painfully obvious. Furthermore, the community and social aspects of the game are absolutely horrible. The only thing you'll see someone type most of the time in-game are either insults or hacking accusations, and most of the time your teammates will be doing solo kill runs while rarely focusing on objectives, inevitably resulting in loss, and consequentially, more rage. Compared to the last year, opposed from previous reviews by others, hacking has (almost) been abolished by Reloaded's new anti-cheat engine, named 'FairFight'. Whether hacks for the game still exist or not are unknown, but you'll rarely find a person using a script in the game nowadays, lest they get caught, publicly shamed, and banned by their automatic anti-cheat program.  I've installed APB two times, and tried my hardest to get back into it. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but unless you've got some balls and a good trigger finger, or a team of friends backing you up, it's not worth the download. Overall, APB: Reloaded has not aged well since it's initial release.  Summary:  Gameplay - 4/10 Community - 1/10 Graphics/Visuals - 7/10 Replayability - 5/10 Immersion - 4/10  Overall: 4/10
59	0	a	Gold players invade bronze servers to get their ranks up, not to mention at any time, you can go onto the store, buy the most OP weapon and use it forever and ever. Unplayable, unfair trash excuse of a game.
60	0	a	It's decent, but it takes a special person to be able to tolerate all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t this game can produce. It's fun, if you're willing to try to get good at the game.
61	0	a	Heard this game was good in the past.  As a low level, kept getting my s*** pushed in my players 300+  Not a good experience :( I'll just wait for GTAV
62	0	a	This game is an unbalanced piece of trash, don't bother with it. Customization options are truly amazing which is sad because everything else is full of crap. Came back after a year and it's still the same. Only new content is pricey premium weapons and other stuff. Uninstalled and never coming back.
63	0	a	Greetings everyone who decides to read this Review of APB.  I'm an EX-player of APB:R after an insane amount of time and felt it was a duty to help give some advice on this game.  **NOTE: I'VE HAD AN APB ACCOUNT PREVIOUS TO THE CREATION OF MY STEAM ACCOUNT.**  The world of APB:R is immense in the sense of how whacky and fun it can be. You'll encounter strange occurances with objects (cars in this instance) interacting stupidly with other objects and it's all a joy. I've sincerely have had a lot of fun with this game. Oh! One more thing, the entire concept of APB:R being 'Pay to Win' is a complex haox from everything I've encountered in my 4 year run with APB.   How is it not Pay to Win?   Simple. All 'ARMAS' weapons you'll see in the game are typically re-skins or variations of the same weapon you can achieve with normal gameplay and progression.  Example: Joker CR Rifle is the exact same as the N-TEC and VARS-SWORD.  Many of these guns just are bought for their advantages due to their pre-set modifications which even then an ordinary player can obtain after playing for a bit of time.  The Customization is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, I've never had such a creative outlet in my life previous to APB:R. Making a fresh and beautiful designed IO: GROWL, or FireHawk Vegas or whatever car of your pleasing is one of the best things you can do in APB:R. Show it off to your fellow faction-mates and even those on the opposing side! Make your own death-theme for your victims to listen so that they know it was YOU who ended their misery. Customize your clothing, get creative with tattoos! Enjoy an environment that's not restricted to just PRE-SET PRE-DESIGNED decals like most games would have.  Wait! This review is NOT recommending this game why?  Over the last couple of weeks, something has been happening. Something that has been triggering/messing with player-base. The ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM: FAIRFIGHT, in addition to the formerly used PUNKBUSTER, has been flagging players, both cheaters and non-cheaters, and respectfully banning the player in question.  Isn't that a good thing?  Well, I'd suppose it would be a good thing that the anti-cheat system is actually banning people and actively detecting the use of horrid third-party programs and the lot, but, what about those who were non-cheaters?  I'm one of those players.  I'm formerly known as the criminal: xShadowscythe.  A few days ago, I logged into the game I've loved for so long, entered a match, and as I was driving to my next destination BANNED.  Oh? Banned? You could just open a ticket to GamersFirst, maybe they'll help you out?   NOT AT ALL.  Although the game is fantastic and such, the company that hosts the game is unwilling to clarify/justify/assist any of it's players with any information regarding to why they were banned.  Upon sending an email to the support staff, I've been handed an automated letter and have not been given any insight onto why I was banned from the game other than 'Someone has been conducting suspicious activity that violates our Terms of Service.' Upon a request for clarification or for a reason I was promptly sent away and denied with yet another automated message.  For those who have read this review and thinking of still playing APB:R  I sincerely hope you give the game a shot and help in it's resurrection, but please be aware of the corruption and malfunctioning system in place as of OCTOBER 31ST, 2016. I sincerely hope you all have a good time in the game and will leave this review with one final piece of advice.  Please DO NOT spend any money on the game for a good amount of time. Please take time to talk to other players, preferably veterans, about the status of the game, the recent banning issues and how GamersFirst communicates with it's players.  Love,   xShadowscythe.
64	0	a	This game has been technologically stagnant for years, and hasn't (as far as I know) seen any patches that truly improved its performance. Unless you have an SSD and 8GB+ of RAM, don't even bother. Chances are the game will be nearly unplayably laggy for you, as it is for the vast majority of players.  On top of that, the game is  heavily  monetized, and takes every opportunity it can to shove all the various ways you can spend money on it down your throat.  Gamers First? More like Money First.
65	0	a	No, just no With Friends maybe yes but alone NO itâ€™s not safe outside anymore! The new Slogan for this game might as well be   'Its just a prank bro!' 'why so serious' 'noob noob noob'   I was also hunted down for having an Iron cross. The SJW Furry-sect clearly hate everything German!  That is the community. Equal to a fake prank Social Justice Fury Vegan Gains Feminist Hilary Supporters Religious Warriors ISIS Onision channel!!! There is NOTHING WORSE than those combined.  Iâ€™m DONE WITH THIS GAME!!!!!!!  p.s I donâ€™t have a thing with furies no. I just put you there because Keck.  Also Vegans, yea its the behaviour that makes you unpopular.  As for the rest Steam salty everywhere brah
66	0	a	Pros: + Free to play + Kinda like GTA Online + Fun to ram pedestrians + I can play Pokemon GO Song and ram stuff  Cons: - Microtransactions - You need to pay to actually get some kills - Microtransactions - Did I mention microtransactions?  Edit: Forgot to mention the microtransactions.

68	0	a	Don't bother trying out this game.  I downloaded this game and it appear to be that they had a server merge and I tried to talk to support about my account and they refuse to restore my account and now I am unable to login   Let's put this straight 'they don't give a single â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about you'
69	0	a	This game has been consistently made worse over the past ~year, with the biggest problems being ignored in favor of introducing more 50$ 'content' of questionable quality.  Avoid.
70	0	a	Customization: Check Cars: Check Hacker termination: Pending... Error Code: $$$ 'They buy ARMAs gear so won't get ban'
71	0	a	Alone: 3/10 With friends: 7/10  Dont bother playing alone.   Grouping system sucks and the community is poor.
72	0	a	Torturously close to being good. Can be played and sometimes enjoyed if you accept that it will never improve. Unfortunately has never been imitated by another game, so there is little motivation for improvement.
73	0	a	APB is an interesting game with tons of potential and would be a wonderful game if it wasn't being developed by one of the worst companies in the industry.
74	0	a	This game is full of the most saltiest individualds I've ever met, it takes Call of Duties community and makes it look like a saint.    as of 3/8/16 nothings changed except the game seems to be more dead AKA still sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥
75	0	a	APB is a very...complicated game. Do you want to become a criminal, and just go to town on a city full of innocent people with riches worth taking, and start massive riots against the police and government? Do you want to be a peacekeeper, and maintain order in a broken city by breaking criminal operations and protecting the innocent? Then what the F*** are you doing playing APB Reloaded? This game is NONE of what it looks like on the surface. After putting more hours than I'm ever thought I would, I can say I can make a worthwhile review.  Let's weigh the Pro's and the Con's  Pro's:  *The game, for a free-to-play, is very good looking. The graphics as far as shadowing and detail goes are top-notch.  *The Character Customization is outstanding. You can literally make whatever you want, within reason. But this can also lead to some bad stuff. See Con's for more info.  *The game has regular seasonal events for Easter, Halloween and Christmas. These game modes, sans Easter, are mainly in the Arena 'Fight Club' mode where certain things have been changed to fit the season. The Christmas one is especially good.  *The game has a very large variety of guns, but more can be said about this in the Con's.  *The game does offer variety to activities depending on the faction that you choose. Criminals can do different things than Enforcers and vice-versa  *There are several instances to play in, so you never really feel left out.   Con's:  *The game is a powerhouse to run. Most PC's won't even be able to handle it, and the 'low' settings don't really help. Most people have to use community made mods to lower the settings down even further than the game allows just to play it. That isn't entirely something that's in GamersFirst's control, but the idea that an outside party mod has to be active for some people to even play is a bit offputting.  *The game has seriously unstable connection problems. Countlessly, you will be lagged out of districts, and while you're in the server, you will be bouncing all over the place trying to get a grip on where you're going, only to shoot back several rooms because the server couldn't keep up. This is a glaring issue, and only exacerbates other problems.  *One such problem includes actually landing shots on enemies. This game has some of the most inconsistant damage I've ever seen in a game, and the shot registration is abysmal. You will find yourself losing gunfight after gunfight simply because the other person is better connected to the server than you, or his gun suddenly does more damage than before. Sometimes, your gun will kill someone in 4 shots, and the next person you shoot takes 9-10 shots to put down. This whole game can be summed up as 'Inconsistant.' That's the bottomline.  *Just because there's a lot of guns, doesn't mean they're all different. There are a lot of guns that function exactly like other guns. The Joker Carbine acts just like the STAC-10. The NTEC acts just like the AR-15. This doesn't even touch on the Snipers. Quite literally, the guns are recycled and released to the public for actual money, where they act just like the last gun they sold. This one just looks different.  *There is a large pay-to-win gap in this game. Most guns can be earned in-game, and some guns can even be made permanent. However, most of the time, you'll be renting leased weapons, and these will only last up to 7 days. Some guns you have to actually pay to make them permanent. This is also an issue in the 'Premium' system, where if you pay for a set amount of time, you gain more money and experience toward your standing. While this isn't too bad and is nowhere near as bad as some other games doing this, it's still a bit unfair to the people just getting into the game.  *The game is very confusing at first, and there is no good tutorial. The way it works is, when you start, you have to gain up reputation with certain people to gain rewards, raise your standing with them to get more rewards, and to increase your threat. The higher your win/loss ratio in missions is, the better your threat is. The three primary tiers are Bronze, Silver, and Gold. There are also ranks within that. Nowhere in the game is this explained to you, or at least explained well. You will have no idea what you're doing for a long while.  *The game has horribly unbalanced matchmaking. More often than not, you will be pitted against people who are far better armed, skilled and familiar with the map than you are, and you will be shut down again and again, because the game will refuse to give you people around your level. Your reputation, Threat, or overall level does not affect who you will get matched up against. I have seen Bronze players go up against Gold players and get utterly annihilated. This kind of thing is far from fair.  *The game has one of the absolute worst communities I have ever seen on a MMO, no, a GAME before. The people on this game range from little kids screaming about how bad you are in the chatbox, to grown men whining and complaining about weapons and tactics you're using. And GOD HELP YOU if you're a Bronze or a Silver on this game. To be a Gold, is to be the scum of the earth in most cases. Golds constantly and consistantly berate Silvers and Bronzes for the most mundane of reasons, and will go out of their way to make your time on this game as unpleasant as possible. Very few people will actually answer any questions you have about the game while playing, and are more likely to make fun of you for not knowing than just telling you. This Con is the most deciding of why this game just isn't worth the time.  *Because of the community being as disgusting as it is, this brings up a very big issue in the Character Customization. With the massive scale in which you have control over your character, comes every negative you can think of to compromise it. You will constantly see fat black men with giant, often neon colored, afros in limited to almost no clothing at all running around, or you may even see Adolf Hitler running around. This is also a problem with the fact that the naming system for your characters is unrestricted, so racial and offensive names are abundant. For every good costumed character running around, there's a 'TyroneFriedChicken' to muck it all up.  *While the game likes to parade the idea of 'FairFight' around like it's some form of trophy, the game is still overrun with hackers. With constant new hacking tools emerging every time another is addressed, you'll constantly see this as an issue. And while the response time to have them removed permanently from the game is rather quick(Most of the time), it's still the fact that they're there in the first place that makes this a problem.   In closing, APB Reloaded is an ex-pay to play MMO shooter with subpar action and goofy as hell ragdoll physics. But it's a dying game, and with the community punching more and more holes in the sinking boat that is this game, and further alienating and shunning new players, it will eventually sink completely. I can not recommend this game to anyone with the condition that it's in. All the FairFight updates in the world can't save this game if the community won't help to keep it afloat.
76	0	a	This game was really a blast. The best part was when I got really high level were everyone had an aimbot or threw around $4,000 dollars to the developers to get really overpowered sniper rifles and machine guns. If you are not willing to buy the $500 dollar guns then you cant have fun in this game.
77	0	a	All I know is after 44 hours (some more if you include the hours I palyed before I played on steam) I was about ready to flip my desk. I had a bigger reveiw earlier, but apparently it was inaccurate. If you are good at this game, good for you. The newbs hate you, and you enjoy your time on the game. Me? This game is only fun for customization. Nothing else, considering I can land one bullet on some veteran players.  BUT I CAN'T STOP â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PLAYING!
78	0	a	This Game is the epitome of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. The redeeming qualitites of this game are few and far between, Playing with your friends on this game can be fun but other than that the gunplay is horrible, You can hide in a vehicle because vehicles have a health bar instead of a damage model and then jump out like a little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when your enemy is reloading, This causes people to use tactics that take advantage of obvious flaws in the game like using overpowered guns. This game is just pure â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unless played with friends , then it is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with sprinkles ontop
79	0	a	This game is owned by 'GamersFirst'(HAHAHHAHA, first?), *cough* I mean 'MoneyFirst'. This game is cancer, in it's most advanced form. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game , but I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate it at the same time. Armas Weapons &gt; every other weapon you can buy with in game curency.  Armas Weapons &gt; skill. Skill means nothing in this pile of crap. Get an Arams Weapon for Trial and I guarantee you , that you will wreck everyone that comes into your way. 'Bronze Server' is for Silver and Gold players, and 'Silver Server' is for Gold players. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you 'GamersFirst' for the 'numerous' updates , for the award winning matchmacking system, and for balancing the districts for each ranks.
80	0	a	I don't recommend this game for the following reasons:  1. It's pay2win. 80% of the people playing have bought premium guns wich are overpowered. This game is just not well balanced.  2. The matchmaking. The matchmaking is totally awful and unfair. It is just not fun to play as a free to player.   3. The Arma's marketplace. Weapons can be bought for a limited use time, character life time, or account life time. Character and account life time guns are really expensive for a single gun. It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.  However,  if you do have money to spent, and you're not triggered easily like me. This game can actually be fun if you have a lot of friends to play with. Be warned though it's a 50/50 game. And that won't change.
81	0	a	The thing about this game is that the company that runs it either doesn't care or is just terrible at taking care of it. As said in previous reviews, if you are not lagging so terribly that you wish your own Mother would murder you, then you're being disconnected from the servers. If it's not the lag that drives you away, then it is most certainly the community of players in the game. There is little to no respect whatsoever among players, and even less for the game itself. This game is riddled with hackers and cheaters. Some may say that this game is highly 'Pay-2-win', although that's not always the truth. However, if you choose to pay for in-game items, be willing to pay quite a bit.   Having said that, I think that in the right hands, this game is the best Free to Play game available. I still play it in hopes that maybe things will get better, but I guess I should know better by now.
82	0	a	Got 37.0 hrs by being stuck in a loading screen 10/10 would loading screen again
83	0	a	i'll rather have a wank to susan boyle's pictures using sandpaper than to play this again.
84	0	a	This review is based on my many years playing this game, from the very beginning of RTW Closed beta til now. And the info that has been collected from time spent on forums/APB Blog.  There was a time when this was my favorite game, and pretty much all i played most of the time. But as time have passed, i'm realizing that the company that bought this game from RTW either gives no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, or are just too incompetent to improve it.  There hasn't been a proper content update for years, all they do is release reskins of already exisitng guns. And if we're lucky, we get an unreleased gun that RTW didn't finish back in 2010. The excuse for the last few years has been the engine upgrade, which might just be in development by 2 people at this point, since they've fired everyone who created the game.  Then there is the forums, one of the few places you could attempt to get some answers from G1. That is if you don't get your thread deleted within minutes, because it asks questions that G1 does not wish to answer. Their solutions to controversy seems to be to just delete any evidence of it, and pretend that everything is perfect in little ol' APB town. But the worst part is that the game is no longer competetive on the global market. Several games blows this game out of the water the second we start talking about gameplay, and really all that this game has got going for it anymore is the customization. You can truly make anything you want, except not anything you want, since G1 has stated several times that they will ban creators of offensive/sexual content, even though it's an 18+ game, and also 2016 guys, seriously.  Pros: + Gameplay (by Original Developers Real Time Worlds) + Customization (very extensive, truly one of the best ever) + Something for both the casual and competetive gamers. (Very random and fun game, but also very skill based) + Might aswell say the game that RTW made, cause this game is fundamentally really good.  Cons:   - Optimization is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. - Utterly dead development wise - Terrible forum management - Gun releases (OP at first to promote sales, then nerfed when bought by players) - Constant Armas Releases (pointless reskins), and nothing else. - The incompetence of the current owners. (G1)
85	0	a	Pros +Uninstall works perfectly  Cons -Too much P2W -Cancer team m8s,community. -Matches ranking unfair -Everyone gets a bazooka and destroy you dont matter how skilled are you at the game  9/11 Would uninstall again
86	0	a	First encounter with people in this game...hackers...I got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...
87	0	a	The only good thing about this game is the customization, which is grossly limited to free-to-play. That being said, the game play is ridiculously repetitive and unbalanced. Aimbot users are rampant with no ingame way to report offenders. The community is full of nothing but adolescent morons that makes â€œBarrens Chatâ€ seem like Shakespeare. I really wanted to get behind this game and even spend some money on it because it is a great concept, but after seeing that this game is just as bad (if not worse) as it was 2 years ago, I can tell that G1 is not serious about developing a decent game.
88	0	a	This game has potential, but GamersFirst (lol) is clearly incapable of giving it the attention it needs to reach that potential. The game is mostly fun, but to have that fun, you have to be prepared to deal with lag/microstutters, hitreg, botters, hackers, crap server performance, exploiters, pornography (player made images), racism, sexism, threats of real world violence, and a near complete lack of GamersFirst presence on the servers. I say near-complete, because there are occasions when the staff makes an appearance, but those are extremely rare occurances.   I would love to recommend this game, but i simply cannot. I have logged almost 2000 hours into this game, and i've watched it mostly degrade in that time.  Best i can tell anyone is, STAY AWAY from this game until GamersFirst (can't even say that with a straight face) either gets the game under control, or sells it to a company that will.
89	0	a	It's like a drug. It's bad for you, but you can't stop. I spent over $200.
90	0	a	Do you love Forced pay 2 win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and a matchmaking so broken, you'll wonder if this was still an aphla? then you'll love this
91	0	a	The real winners in life are those who bought this game for 50 â‚¬ some years back. Congrats!
92	0	a	Want To Know What I Review of This Game?? Its Unfair ...THe Laggy Driving Is Hard Enough..The FIght System Is sooo Unbalance..Like Your Just Started and Your Already Fighting Some High-End Weaponry Players.. and the community is Sooo Unfriendly like they'll never say nice things to ya..if your a weak asset on their team, 'noob' is the title they'll give you.   My Overall Rating For This is Game is -10/10. ~
93	0	a	This game had so much potential. But the develepors ruined it with these things -Pay to win You could literally just buy your way through the game, I mean, every time you entered the shop you would see things you could only buy for cash -Lack of tutorial There was really no way to know what you were doing in this game. They just drop you in the world and expect you know what to do -Lack of Diversity This game felt the same. The guns felt the same, The cars felt the same, The missions felt the same, and it all just blended into a big gray lump of boring
94	0	a	Played original APB under RTW, loved it.  Played APB:R under G1, loved it, for a while.  Pros: Fun game play Fun customisation Can do stupid things like jump a car to the moon Fairfight catches most cheaters Varied Mission objective locations   Cons: Removed the cops and robbers themed missions, now its just 2 teams of gang bangers Rented guns - because who dosen't like to come back to a game after a short break to find out all your stuff has expired? Griefing, by open world players... alot... Punkbuster - Possibly the most overzealous anti-cheat ever made. Poor car handling all except a handful of cars ar elike driving on ice. Armas - Want that cool gun that you saw in a film/game? sure you can have it for the low low price of another AAA game on release day. Random weapon nerfs for existing weapons - Remember the old 5 shot kill FBW that existed for 2 years? not anymore. Joker boxes - because gambling at the tracks is bad but its ok in a game. Broken Armas weapons on release - Whisper? OCA-Nano? Trouble maker anyone? Lag - This happens alot. Poor optimisation - yeah the game dosent run smoothly and will fps spike even on a GTX980ti. Low population - chances are you are going to get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ handed to you consecutively by the same teams over and over agian. Toxic community - if you beat someone you are a hacker, if you lose then you are garbage scrub. Engine update Soonâ„¢ - This was announced back in 2014 I think? Sqeakers - 70% of the people that play this game haven't even hit puberty yet despite the M mature rating.  *Devs constantly try to hold you back by preventing skill based/intelligent play*  Scout rifle jump shot - gone, QS3 sniper quick switch - nerfed, shotgun consistent damage cone (from 2 years back) - nerfed,  CQB joker carbine - nerfed: Ghost shot every other shot,  strafing run oscar - nerfed: Ghost shot every other shot, Utility sniper DMR - nerfed and split into 2 different guns,  tommygun with muzzle brake - nerfed Conc thats that 1 shot on a perfect prime and direct impact - nerfed ntec that used to be accurate up to 70m out - nerfed STAR that used to be worth a damn in CQB - nerfed Cobra rifle - this was never relevant to begin with despite the hefty $30 price tag ATAC - was good on release but nerfed very shortly after PMG with Ex mag3 - nerfed,  Mid air rocket launcher artillery - 2 second charge up timer nerf. Pig stungun + Perc nade - still broken. This list goes on...
95	0	a	I really can't believe I tortured myself with this game for so long.  I immediately fell in love with the idea of the game. Who among us, who grew up in the GTA generation, could refuse a massively multiplayer simulacron? A game where you could run rampant in a bustling city, breaking the law or thwarting lawbreakers. A game where you could make your own theme music, graffiti and design your cars and clothes. A game with a thriving community-driven marketplace.  It wasn't hard to crush those dreams, as the current developers and community have done. The game makes you hate each other. It makes you hate the people hosting and developing it. Matchmaking forces you to discriminate against weaker players being on your squad. Mission types devolve into hateful grudge matches that will make you twitch, sweat, and curse. The low population and broken ranking system will ensure that certain notorious individuals will become your personal arch nemeses. The laughable price point at which gear is pushed by the marketting department will have you cringing. The way in-game money makes people insane will have you questioning your own friends' intentions and paranoia will haunt your every financial decision. The balancing of weapons, and the steep skill landscape will ensure that every now and then your weapon, no matter how spectacular or expensive, will feel like a capgun or limp noodle in your hand.  It took me far too long to realize I wasn't even enjoying myself. I hope this, and other reviews like it, may yet spare someone of the same experience. Oh yes, my love and I spent well into a hundred or so dollars each on this game. It's definitely not even worth trying as a free-to-player. You're severely limitted in every aspect of gameplay unless you're a premium account holder.
96	0	a	So first off I actually started playing this game 6 years ago, but only connected it to Steam recently so that's why my play time is only said to be 100 odd hours. Now honestly I didn't play for all of those 6 years and for the reasons I am about to cover... The game has some heavy pay to win issues, now some people (usually those who pay actually...) defend the game and say that if you earn enough 'joker tickets' you can buy these OP premium weapons for 7 days. The problem I'd argue is that it takes about a week for doing specific missions known as 'fight club' missions to actually achieve the joker tickets necessary in the meanwhile you are facing off against opponents whom oay for premium weapons and I have always played without paying any money so I can most defintley confirm that premium weapons absolutley out class their standard counter-parts and only after heavy modification after loads of playing time can one even stand on the same level as a premium weapon. Of course natrually a premium assault rifle will still lose out to a standard shotgun at point-blank range assuming the shotgun is being used well as it is not unheard of for a shotgun to lose in this scenario. I have played with the regular weapons then one-day trialed their premium counter-parts and it is very easy to notice the difference.   Another issue is that the community are generenally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, like if you've ever thought a community in a game like LoL is bad then wait till you see APB. But yeah people won't be kind to you. Also this has been massively improved upon (as once this was literally no exaggeration a problem every other match in a standard district) but there is still the occassional hacker that ruins the game. But I am thankful as this is way less common than before.  On the flip-side the customisation is better than any game I have ever seen ever and I do love it. It is incredibly in-depth and you can truly create your own identity, both in your character and vehicle. However once more customisation is better with premium allowing you to obtain a few more pieces of gear that are usually impossible to get due to pricing and also more decals are allowed on you and your gear and vehicles if you are a premium member.  Also I generenally find the combat fun, hit detection can be quite bad. But if you aren't playing against a load peeps using premium weapons, which makes up a large amount of the community, then it is quite fun and skill based. But as I said no matter how skilled you are your assualt rifle will lose out to a premium assualt rifle at almost any range. Except there does exist the odd bad premium weapon.  Overall I wouldn't recommend. Unless like me you love customisation and the game can be very fun, it has a few interesting gameplay features/ the game just feels unique in it's gameplay despite just being a third person shooter. But if you play for free you'll find yourself heavily disadvantaged and will recieve slightly limited customisation options. Having said that the customisation is still truly amazing and it's weird to think that a not so good game can nail one mechanic so much better than any other I've ever seen.
97	0	a	This game has some good ideas, but poor execution. Whilst the ability to customise your character and vehicles along with themes and other things are very nice and have good variety, the controls for the vehicles are poor and tend to feel sluggish. Other problems that hinder it are poor mission opponent matching with it most often resulting in overpowered experienced people against newer, less well equipped people. This also is shown when a Gold Rank player is left to pay on a Bronze level server even when they should not be allowed to since they are far better skilled/equipped than what the server is designed for. Bronze should be for Bronze only, Silver for Silver and Gold for Gold so as to issue the best matching. Another issue that is prevalent is the way characters ranking is scored, quite often I will go Gold Rank after having a good few rounds. However, this will put me against other gold rank people who are leagues ahead in equipment and skill and leave me feeling frustrated as I lose due to being put against an opponent that is clearly too high a skill level for my own skills. Also seen whilst playing is the way the pay to play aspect causes imbalance in equipment levels. Whilst I do want to pay toward keeping such an interesting game alive, I feel it would be unfair to the other free to play players as I would then gain access to guns and equipment that are far better than anything F2P can access without having to grind multiple days worth of time to get close to having something similar. This is a clear example of Pay to Win. Finally, and most importantly, along with being the worst point against this game, there are just too many cheaters that uses hacks on this game, it's a well known issue but in the whole time playing this game, nothing has been done to stop it. Too often has it been the case I've gone to verse a team of criminals that quite clearly have players that are using hackers to boost there accuracy or take less damage when shot. This is quite obvious when you are two shot killed by a shotgun or pistol more than 100m from your opponent or open fire on said opponent first but discover that even after multiple direct hits they will kill you in three shots.  Overall, a nice concept with some good ideas but poorly executed with too many bugs and hackers.
98	0	a	I've played this game over 8000 hours( mostly non steam as you can see ). I've wasted 1000 of euros of ingame transactions..  Alot of hackers â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Engine â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GM's  I do not recommend this game,  Pros:  U can pretty much customize everything.
99	0	a	5/5 Unistall button works
100	0	a	Matchmaking is absolutely god-awful. Expect to be matched with people several tiers below your level against max rank players. Half of all the rounds I've played have been unfairly skewed in the opponent's favor. Of course, I shouldn't be bashing new players for being bad- we all once were- but I do start to get a little annoyed when I'm being placed in a team with them on a very consistent basis.  In addition, this game is infested with cheaters/macroers. Ok, maybe I'm in no position to start 'hackusating' others- I have no proof whatsoever- but when people maintain *perfect* accuracy at long distances/whilst jumping, know where you are, whenever you are and come to kill you no matter how many walls there are between you and them, then maybe, just maybe, there's something to be suspicious about.   That's all I have to stay. Please, just stay away. This game needs to die.
101	0	a	I love this game. I love the customization it grants you. I love playing with friends.  Sadly, the gamebase is full of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, granting you the title of 'noob', even though you try your hardest. 3/10
102	0	a	It's pay to win. The community is worse then CS:GO's community. Lots of cheaters and hackers.  However the game itself is not that bad.
103	0	a	This game is very demanding and ohh would you look at that a storm broke out outside my house,its far more interesting than this game.
104	0	a	I have really played this game a bunch. Back when it was pay2play.  In that state though the game was alot better. Let me just state it in pro's and cons:  Pro's: + Fun to play together and in clans + RP Possibility + Big map Cons: - Lag, very unstable  - Hackers, oh god the hackers, not normal. Unplayable since the game has been F2P  - Micro transactions are terrible.. - Player base is low..  Play it.. Dont play it. Whatever you decide.  I wouldnt, not worth it.  R.I.P  APB Reloaded.
105	0	a	The medicore gameplay and seemingly limitless customization gives the game extreme potential (nothing beats driving a windowless white van with 'free candy' painted on the sides), but the blantly underscored Pay2Win business model and the imbalance it creates for players will cause you to rage so hard that your blood pressure and body temprature will rise high enough for your insides to become Oblivion and you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ diamonds.  It's a damn shame: expanding the objectives in the game's missions and retooling the buisness model to make it more fair could really unlock a good bit of that potential.
106	0	a	APB:R What can i say this game is a guilty pleasure of mine BUT there are sooo many broken mechanics to the game so lets name a fiew -Matchmaking is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ -all sweet items are locked off to high ranks -Extermely harsh on new players  -Cheap weapons  -G1C  i gotta say The premium feature broke it for me,locking off most of the bigger features of customization off to new players is just cheap and feels like 'HEY THIS GAME IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,LETS MILK MORE CASH OUT OF IT' the new publishers are just being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ milking the cash cow all day i wouldnt have a problem if i wouldnt be getting ranked with golds on bronz and silver dics (I myself am bronze) And i think its Unair that a 255 can get into a bronz disc where there will be people ranking from 1 to 100 ,it makes it unfair and not fun getting into a game where your team is completely made from new players and the other team is made from 255s and golds, i think they should you make a level lock on bronz servers,once you hit 200 thats it you cant enter bronze servers anymore,ive been helping my friend getting into the game but as always its hard as hell getting a player who only has 20 hours on the game to get intrest init with a broken as crap matchmaking system,at least rank it by the levels or as my previus idea lock off 255s from bronze servers,i know some APB:R vets and some think i got a point others think my struggle is usles in some point it is but its stupid  What i think this game needs are some changes,changes for the better  These changes are: -Make all customization options for all players (Free and prem) -Make G1C items cheaper(Im not paying 14 bucks for a perm gun that i wouldnt even like at the end) -a way to make g1c in game from playing it or a weekly reward of 10 to 5 G1C -Free goodies and weapon rewards from mission drops -Matchmaking where ranks ranging from 50 to 60 would get matched but ranks like 10 againts 255 wouldnt -Make a permanent block on all 200+ players on bronze servers 
107	0	a	it was fun but turned to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around a year ago and is showing no signs of improvements.  pros: - character and car editors are still unrivaled  cons: - greatly imbalanced gameplay - bad mission and level design - the worst community i've ever seen - huge performance issues - tons of hackers  may 21st 2015 UPDATE: game still bad

112	0	a	if the developers would put as much time into the actualy gameplay mechanics as they do customization then this game would be one of the best.  poor/ immature comunity third person shooter level 1 newbies need to fight max level players or in other words you can be killed in one hit and you need to shoot others 10 times. bad driving mechanics very little to do  let this game die and take it off steam. i have no interest in this game unless they remove or ratify the above problems
113	0	a	This game is awful.   1. FPS mechanics are terrible, with NO HEAD HITBOXES. AWFUL HIT DETECTION. EXTREMELY LONG TTK (which would be fine if there were skill-based mechanics involved).   2. Extreme pay to win a la Asian shooter, i.e. you have to either spend all of your time playing this game, spend money, or fail to be competitive due to expiring weapons.   3. Maps and respawns were balanced by chimps. Some missions favor one side immensely over the other. Not to mention the vapid objective based gameplay.   4. Matchmaking is terrible with veterans having extreme advantages over new players with perks. Sure CoD can do this, but it doesn't make it any less stupid.   5. Cheaters abound.   6. Little variety at the core of the game which is quintessentially a few big team-based CTF flags with car chases in between. Sounds fun on paper and is fun the first 30 times, then it gets old along with the rock-paper-scissors gunplay.   The only good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics are fair and it runs.. alright. The character, car and clothes customization is amazing, along with the custom themes (music editor), but it's at the core a grindy, imbalanced collection of little CTF maps where the world around you feels fake and shallow, just like the gunplay.   Don't waste your time downloading this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It had potential 10 years ago. Now it's just a waste.   
114	0	a	I played APB Reloaded when it was in beta, it was a great game and had some cool concepts for both Enforcers and Criminals. Then ARMAS shop was open and it all went to trash, 'Gamersfirst' nerfed the witnessing system to oblivion so its no longer viable for enforcers. Noobs that spend 10$ or more can wreck veterans that have 2000+ in game hours, even if you're silver and supposed to get paired with silvers and bronzes, you'll most probably be paired with rank 255 golds with ARMAS. Just dont play it, its not worth the time nor the effort, it was a good game, yet P2W components â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed it up totally.   In the other hand, the game concept is fun, yet as I said you're not going anywhere without using cash or at least spending 3000hrs or more.  EDIT: Forgot to say, dont play it please and if you already do, dont spend money on it unless you really like the game, dont give this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ devs any more money, they dont deserve it.
115	0	a	Game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it's slowly dying..  Don't belive me? Here take a look:  http://steamcharts.com/app/113400   GamersFirst will try to drag as many money out of the players, before they go under..  Please DO NOT spend any money on the game for a good amount of time. Please take time to talk to other players, preferably veterans, about the status of the game, the recent banning issues and how GamersFirst communicates with it's players.  So my Rating: 2/10 GamersFirst have ruined this game...  RIP APB 1987-2016 
116	0	a	Cheater and Lags, nothing more to say
117	0	a	This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game is about as functional as Helen Keller
118	0	a	0/10 CAN'T WEAR A SKIRT AS A MAN
119	0	a	Back in 2013 I wrote a review for APB, my review consisted of me explaining that it was a good game broken but good, after this review I quit APB for a while (2 years). Recently I came back to APB because I remembered all the good times I used to have and all the fun it was. I launched it, I signed in, and I chose a district. It was good I felt all the nostalgic memories coming back to me and it felt good. Then I thought I should do a mission, I got into one and it started at this point I remember why I quit why I needed three new keyboards throughout one month and why I was such an angry gamer back then; this game just really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks.The match making is bad, very bad, its real life counterpart would be a coach that coaches children to play football then there first game they go and compete in the NFL. The game is very much a pay to win, unless you feel like dedicating two years of your life to grinding levels by getting wrecked by the same players over and over again to get a gun that will change your 0.06% of a kill to a 1% of a kill, youâ€™re going to have to pay about 100$ (but even then there is still some one that will have payed up more than you). The physics are not as bad as they could be but are still very bad. The game does not seem to think that cars, players, and other movable objects should be affected by gravity. The physics are the only thing in this game that is broken but because it is broken it is good and worth a couple laughs.   Lastly the pit of what very well could be the worst game ever created: GamersFirst. Their name is nothing but irony because that is the last thing they do, in fact there name should be MoneyFirst because it precisely what they live for. GamersFirst has owned APB for 5 years now I think, and in those 5 years what have they done?  Fix the game engine? No!  Fix matchmaking? No!  Update game engine? No! Implement a better anti-cheat? No! Fix servers? No! Add new cars and weapons? Hell yes we have tons of those, but only for people that are willing to pay! GamersFirst have not added any free or upgraded content in the entire ownership in the game but instead will add content that is only those willing to pay 300$ for a new car. In fact the game is virtually the same game as it was when they bought it if you remove all the payed features.    My recommendation for this game? Donâ€™t waste your time, instead go try a good free to play game like War Thunder, TF2, or War Frame. The worst part about it is the fact that for new players APB is quite addicting and if you start you have a good chance to sink in a good hundred to buy you that shiny new thing you want, so just donâ€™t even start. 
120	0	a	pay2win.. also processor raper v3
121	0	a	money money money money mooooonay, MOOONAYY
122	0	a	Think League of Legends has a toxic community? You haven't seen APB's yet.  Also this game is terrible.
123	0	a	Is a coooool game but u need to pay for 90% of game ( tunning car , good weapons etc )
124	0	a	Well, where to start...  1. The game offers the possibility to adopt different gameplay styles, according to scenery. 2. Besides having, and of course, claiming to have a 'good system' to prevent cheating, there hasn't been a day that goes by that one does not come across, either by using macro's or simply Aimbot. 3. The cheating 'community' for this game is also constantly developing to overcome the system in play (check U n k n o w n C h e a t s ). 4. Crying, crying, sobbing and sugar... A typical found combination during gameplay, due to the dominant age of the players involved (mainly from 13 to 17), resulting in ghosting missions, chat rage, abusive use of /report commands, and so on. 5. Random stutters (from 1 to 2 secs of freeze) during missions, occurring in a spontaneous fashion. 6. LAG. Yeah... since 2012 I must recognize that it has gotten worse.  7. Just to end on some 'good terms': create or join a clan or simply play with a friend. This game becomes more appealing that way and creates a better experience.   Overall Rate: 5/10
125	0	a	Like what Grand Theft Auto is, but boring. It does allow you to make your own music, so you'll have a thousand internet dorks having the game play Still Alive in your ears when they kill you.
126	0	a	Let me sum this game up for you in one (two?) word(s).  Aimbot.
127	0	a	Overloaded cash-shop filth. The gameplay can be quite fun, but it's largely overshadowed by insanely bad matchmaking and purchaseable power. Would not recommend this game or anything that GamersFirst puts out.
128	0	a	It's just bad...
129	0	a	Good potential, Bad company. ;) I rest my case
130	0	a	super pay to win and new players have no chance at all. if you havn't already be playing this game for months don't even bother with it it will only frustrate you 
131	0	a	Optimized with a potato.
132	0	a	APB Reloaded is fun for the first few days. After a while it gets repetitive with only 3 maps or called ' Districts ' in the game, Financial, Waterfront and Social. The driving mechanics is rather delayed and takes time to get use to. Customization is very diverse where you can make your own symbols that you can either put on your body as a tattoo, cars, and clothing. Gameplay is unbalanced and seems Pay2win. AI citizens are repasted around the districts and are dumb at sometimes. The two factions are the Enforcers and the Criminals, each faction have their own cars and contacts. Contacts don't have much peronality as they're just mindless AI characters with repetitive dialouge. Gun markets seem cheap, you can only buy them for a limited time for ingame currency. I give this game a 6/10.
133	0	a	So, I wrote a review about this game a while back. But seeing how I didn't play much of it, I thought i'd give it another chance. So I went over to a friends house who had a better built PC, and played it there. After all this time... Still sucks. It's just another Pay-To-Win grind-fest. You either shell out 30 bucks for a gun that probably isn't very good, or you play for weeks and weeks only to be able to buy some freaking shoes, or some other low-end customization thing. The player creation screen is still confusing as all hell. The guns are generic and firefights are just the same everytime. Controls are clanky and slow. Cars handle like theyre on ice. And now, there are hackers on basically every server. So... Have fun with that. The Devs seem to be completely out of touch with their 'Fanbase' because these have been problems for about a full 2 years. There are also never any sales or community events. that 99.99 DLC went on sale ONCE for 69.99, woa~~~~~h. Just don't waste time. Go play TF2 or Blacklight, something that's worth the effort
134	0	a	Played for about an hour, after not playing since October 2014.  First mission was a loss - was told to kill myself  Second mission, I was the only person on my team that didn't die - told to kill myself for not defending  Started free-roaming - told to kill myself after killing an infamy 5 and stealing the loot in his van
135	0	a	THE worse game i have played so far, you cant kill any other player....except for your teammates and enforcers who actually decide to give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about you, i played this game and redownloaded twice due to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PCs and let me tell you It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ REASONS!: 1: your teams can choose and will probably do so: kill you for the sake of killing or to do the mission themselves 2: enforcers cant make easy money like criminals 3: aiming, shooting and killing machinics: SUCK!! 4: way too much like uberstrike with limit time using weaposn you have to buy....and re-buy....and RE-BUY 5: IT'S â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!   worse game ever made 0 outta 10
136	0	a	Like games where the 'good' players are a selected few who are willing to spend IRL money in the game for op gear that cancels out the skill factor of games? well no further because within 4 hours of me playing and enjoying it i have encountered two players with weapons that can kill me within a matter of seconds from any distance. a game with alot of good potential with developers who clearly dont care isnt a good combo and this is a incredible example they remove the fun out of a game that is basically GTA online PLEASE DONT PLAY THIS GAME for your sake it is trash and will ruin the joy you were having from it when you encounter the cancer of the games community

141	0	a	This game sucks. You basically have to hack to get kills. Movement is glitchy and to nerfed to even play. If you are a F2P don't bother, all the people who have stuff are already better then you, forcing you to get the DLCs. Don't play this game.
142	0	a	dont have money like me? the game become super hard!!!! play it if you pro most people has pay 2 play guns and stuff realy hard to win good luck.  pretty sad you must pay to customise clothes like a normal person  pretty sad you must pay to customise cars at all pretty sad you must pay to have 'Better' guns  this game pretty sad :/ i liked the idea but the pay to play ruined it :(  have money? go ahead and play it!
143	0	a	The game does not have a big enough playerbase for new players to get into the game.  Started off my first game against people that had better pistols than my assault rifle. I was getting sniped before even getting to the objective with a revolver.   So if you're not down to put $60-100 into the game there's no way you're gonna be able to enjoy this.
144	0	a	Their support is terrible and you will get randomly banned at any point in time.  Their system 'fair-fight' is a mockup puppet system which allows they to flag any account and make it look like they where detected.  Save your money and do not support this company.
145	0	a	Even for a F2P, this game is utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The graphics look terrible, the gameplay sucks, and the game gets stale after a few hours.
146	0	a	This game is very pay to win and you've got a 90.5% chance to be forced to go agenst players that are double if not triple the rank you are. It's not fair man...

150	0	a	3 words: Pay, To, Win
151	0	a	This game is ok, I still would not reccomend it unless you have a group of friends to play with. Dont expect to have things like in the pictures unless you spend the time and design the patterns on your own or are willing to pay for it.
152	0	a	ok so this was my all time favorite game on steam  even with its p2w features, i liked the game  you can make tons of friends while playing it  why i dont recommend you say?  well for some unknown reason they banned me, i sent a ticket asking why and they responded with 'your acc has been permanently disabled'  500+ 200hr on this game just to get banned  The game itself is a fun game, G1 doesnt care about the game, all they want is money  Pros and cons in my point of view Pros +customization +lots of guns +lots of cars +decent sized map to play  Cons -p2w -hackers -G1 -p2w -G1 -and some more hackers  PS. i would have recommended this game if they had not done me dirty.  -G1
153	0	a	I really like how each person can be either a police or a criminal and complete certain tasks and missions TOGETHER! Unfortunately, not a lot of people play this game. I wouldn't recommend you this game unless you play with your friends. Playing alone with random people is pretty boring after a while.
154	0	a	I played APB Reloaded when it was in beta and could only be played through G1 luancher. They banned me for no reason after +900 hours on my account and spent ~$800. Recently i've contacted them and they wouldn't even give me a proper response, only the bullshnoz generic email. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ G1
155	0	a	Buggy mess that's seriously in need of VAC support.
156	0	a	game is pay to win, community is a hybrid of league of legends and middle school edge, gameplay is fun but ruined by these two factors
157	0	a	It sucks. It's Pay to Win so everyone is able to kill new people instantly.

159	0	a	This game goes the extra mile for making everyone unique if you're willing to pay some money. That's not bad, but the actual game is. Controls are awkward and the sandbox maps feel grand at first but after exploring for a small amount of time I was already back where I had started. Aiming always feels off, and you have to focus way too much on it if you want to kill someone far away or not injured at all. Missions in sandbox mode are not always fair since they could match you with someone 4 times your level. This game could've been great but the gameplay and controls are sketchy and cars suck too. If you're bored on a weekend, try it, but if you're looking for a Saints Row here you are not going to find it at all. Three out of Ten.
160	0	a	This is a review of APB Reloaded  Or atleast it would be if i could actually get on the game... I keep getting an error saying my physx has a problem of some sort ive tried the suggestions and this still does not work i regret wasting 30 minutes of my life on this trying to get it on the actual game instead of trying to sort out launcher problems. I only downloaded this game to prove to my friend that I would not like it at all and by the looks of the dlc it seems to be more expensive than other triple A titles what look more pleasing, fun and have probably got better gameplay overall, however for now and forever this will be my personal opinion on this game, and anyone whos having this problem then please please please dont waste 30 mins of your precious time.  The DLC is worth Â£107 overall wtf!?
161	0	a	Don't get me wrong, i love this game but...  Anti Cheat is crap, mostly Pay 2 Win and the servers are crap. AND dont forget about the Engine! :D  Just PLEASE, don't waste your money on this game until they fixed all those issues.
162	0	a	Been playing since Real Time Worlds. Very customized, upgraded, armed characters. Migrated account when G1 took over. Had a lot of fun. Bought lots of G1 items. Premium too. In one of the first ban sweeps I was banned. Apparently they erroneously banned over 2000 people when this happened. I got unbanned. Then got banned again the next day. Contacted G1; my support ticket was locked, I was banned from G1 forums after posting what happened, and all my accounts were locked. Over $100 down the drain, and my RTW character. Avoid this game. It had a time when it was good; that time is not now. Maybe when they upgrade to the next Unreal engine but besides that, avoid. Bad customer service, money hungry devs, rage-filled community, very PTW items and fair matchmaking does not exist. The Bronze Gold Silver tier matchmaking just doesn't work. Avoid.  Pros: good customization Cons: Angry player base, PTW weapons, bad customer service, money hungry devs, unbalanced matchmaking   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   they banned my original RTW account, unbanned it, then rebanned it again for no reason. My account name was Flonga, and was completely clean. i was banned in a erroneous ban along with 3,000 other players. I paid lots of dosh and played many hours. I hate this game. But I'm redownloading it because I love it so much. But my RTW account is forever gone and for no reason at that. My thread that I created on the forums got many hits and replies and was brought to the attention of the staff. They unbanned me along with many others. In a short amount of time I was banned again for no reason, just like the first time. I posted in the forums again and was BLOCKED FROM ALL FORUM COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE MY THREAD THAT EMBARASSED THEM. I made another account to post on the forums and that was blocked as well. I love RTW, I really hate Reloaded studios. And still I'm redownloading it. I hope one day they will unban me (because I did literally nothing wrong like wtf). Until then, this game is terrible. But I love it. But it's terrible. I had so many weapons cars and mods and weapon mods and apparel and symbols and everything is gone. For what? Give me my account back that was TAKEN away from me
163	0	a	Unoptimized, full of bugs, pay2win weapons, community made of try hard teenagers.  Waste of your time. Don't play this game.
164	0	a	this game sucks pay2win
165	0	a	APB Reloaded seems to be a good idea on paper. What is that idea? Make an online multiplayer game that somewhat seems to be based off of GTA. Does this idea work? I'd say it's a tad mix of both 'yes' and 'no'.  To begin, you can choose from two 'factions' and these are the criminals and the police. The criminals commit crimes and work together to cause as much chaos as possible. These can be as simple as stealing a car and ramming over many pedestrians or working together to rob stores and escape. Eventually, you will cause enough trouble and then you will become a target for the cops (who happen to be controlled by other players). While creating chaos can be fun, I found myself working alone and seeing many other criminal players doing the same thing. I hardly saw two criminals working together during my playtime. Being a target for the cops isn't much fun either as the main goal for the cops seemed to be just finding you and killing you. They don't try to arrest you or anything of the sort; they just chase you and bring you down with bullets. After you die, you just respawn and do it all over again. There are some sort of missions in the game but I wasn't given the slightest clue to where they were. I found a suitcase and was told to deliver it to some location but don't expect the map to get you anywhere as it wasn't much for help.  After derping around with the criminal faction I played the cop faction. Problem is, I found difficulty in even finding my way out of the spawn area and, as stated before, the map isn't much for help. My best guess is that the cop faction patrols the city area and is given a list of target criminals to find and gun down.  Here's a short list of pros and cons that include some points that were not covered: + Vehicles handle differently in an appropiate manner + Graphics look fairly good + Creating chaos is enjoyable + Fair amount of character and vehicle customization + Basic free roaming is entertaining - Map is hard to deal with - Difficult to find missions - Little teamwork - Slight lag issues - Police only shoot down criminals - Community is known to be a little less than friendly  Eventually the confusion and constant deaths bored me and I can't recommend this game to anyone. It'll be nice to uninstall this game to make room for a more deserving one.
166	0	a	Extremely P2P, virtually impossible to keep your gear, unless you pay ofcourse
167	0	a	BasiC is in this game. 1/10 would not recommend
168	0	a	Pay to win. describes APB perfectly
169	0	a	I left this morning to work only to be involved in a car accident ' not at fault' , I was rushed to the hospital and after exhausting day they found nothing wrong with me , except bruises and sores. I took a cab home,, unfortunately the taxi was rear ended, they took me back to the same hospital , the staff wasnt helpful, they laughed their â™¥â™¥â™¥ off at my misery and that's not all, I now have a wrist fracture thanks to the medical staff for slamming the gurney into the wall,, and to all that. I still would rather experience this day then to play APB Reloaded again, this game is just awful.
170	0	a	Awful game. This game was so poorly recieved on launch that the developers had to make it free to play to keep people interested. But that wasn't enough. They had to go a step further by making it so the only way to win was to buy weapons with real money. No matter how skilled you may be, if you try and play with the default weapons, you will be killed in .00001 seconds 90% of the time by a person who paid for theirs. That, and it lags more than GTA online, for God's sake.
171	0	a	The game itself is alright, the customization is great. Everything else sucks..to simply to put it.  Terrible community but an even worse support. They spend more time on trying to make a fast buck over helping players who were falsely banned. Whether you pay or not you're on their ignore list. If you try posting on the G1 forums they'll lock the thread and tell you to submit a support ticket, and if you submit a ticket, you'll get an automated-response that doesn't help you at all. The matchmaking is unbalanced, 9/10 times I get opposition that suck so bad they accuse me of hacking, apparently that isn't better than you will call you a hacker. There's a handful of exploits that people take advantage of. People will grief you constantly. There's only 4 maps total, 2 of them are pretty much just deathmatches. It's not pay2win but it the weapons are significantly better so in the right hands they can make a person unstoppable. There's a variety of missions but more or less repetitive. Enforcers get stun guns which can become very annoying very quickly, marketplace items are beyond overpriced. If you have no friends to play with in this game, it can really disappoint. Every so often you'll also come across hackers.  OVERALL  Game: 7/10 Community: 4/10 Support: 0/10  Total: 11/30  In other words, don't waste your time on a game that won't waste its time on you.
172	0	a	The only good thing this game has is its character customization the engine swap is not going to fix the fact that most of the weapons are balanced terribly, weapon and character modifications make no sence, the real stupid strafing back and forth while shooting being a liable tactic, the hit boxes being bigger than your character so when crouched behind a wall you are still able to get hit by enemy fire, the moving up and down behind cover and maintaining good accuracy while shooting, Being thrown of course while driving because someone that is not on your mission rammed you and flip you over and lastly the fact that some of the weapons that are secondarys should be a primary weapon. APB needs more then an engine swap it needs to be redesigned and re balanced in order for it to be a good game.
173	0	a	since the G1C spike and gamers first yet â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ another great P2P game i will say this.  this game is fun to a point... the game lags online syncing issues and also the fact that  Armas weapons and a variety of other things make this game unbalanced. not to mention  they are using PUNKBUSTER of all anti hacks that any script kiddie with the iq of a rock  can bypass and make aimbots ruin the overall experience. i blame the minor part of the  gamer community that plays FB games and the ever popular 'micro transactions' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up the rest of the experience for all of use. well here we go.. the games physics sucks... a small jump can turn your car over which seems to be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing blimp with wheels.  animations or horrible. the other thing.... customization for free users to limited and requires you to get premium for a half way looking decent character. premium costs 5 dollars to 400G1C. also... your are going to hate people after playing this because the ammount of trolls and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s kill you with a  small burst from a smg or other fire arm while you have the dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥ shit little 556 rifle they give you and expect you to kill something with it. so you get through the tutorial get a new gun play missions get new gear car etc.  the issue left is money you need alot of money get get anything decent. so formula higher rating you have more money you get, lower rating lower money. so.. hell if you have a few dollars anyways... and you dont want to listen to me go on play it.  but as a community ambassador i say to you not to play this filth please.... just dont there are so many better games out there... the community for this game is alright.. but trust me when i say this just dont bother.. sure its addicting and fun to play with freinds. but play it alone for a little when you play with freinds you will over look things but alone you will see why this game is terrible and how you die fast. i almost forgot..... weapons you buy WILL EXPIRE! you want weapons that dont expire PLAY THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME GET A REWARD TO CHOOSE A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PERMA WEAPON... sorry that is all good bye...
174	0	a	What's the point of having so much customization available in this game if you're just going to get banned when you make a member of the SS with the username AryanMasterRace?
175	0	a	Horrible community always getting abused for winning and sometimes losing.  p.s Rip my feelings
176	0	a	An extremely poor game, riddled with hackers and bugs. This game was originally a subscription based game run by an EA owned company, but they folded and RELOADED Productions picked this game up, hence the game being renamed to APB Reloaded. The European servers I can only describe as awful, with many experiencing critical lag spikes and rubber banding. Some experienced hackers even use methods to lag switch, increasing your ping- forcing you to stay in one place; while he/she can shoot you on the spot. The hacking in this game is awful, the game company are powerless to stop it, and they have refused to update the game's anti-hack engine to sort this out. To add to insult, it's considerably easier for Criminals to make more money than enforcers, and many people have an account on both, one low ranked criminal that farms money from ram raids, and one enforcer who's a high rank and gets given the money through another account.  THE GAME: Gameplay is of a basic F2P 3rd person shooter, overly average graphics, with below average gunplay (some sub machine guns kill in 5 hits, while an assault rifle in a bigger calibre may take 7, go figure). This game is extremely pay to win, with many locks put on the player as a F2P member. See all those awesome car decals? That player's got premium. So you got premium, you've made your car but it looks all pixely? That's their new decal system, to skimp on money they lowered the texture qualities so they didn't have to purchase more servers (confirmed from staff from inside source). Many of the buy with real money guns are overpowered as heck, killing in half the time of in-game cash guns, while also being more accurate and considerably faster to reload.  THE FORUMS: Don't use them. A nasty throwback to the past, and rife with overtly corrupt staff. There are many stories of people being banned for hacks, when they get unbanned for no reason by an Admin, the two suddenly emerge as best of friends, and anyone who argues is labelled a troll and silenced. Also, some of the moderators aren't even old enough to play the game, when they recruited Forum Mods they didn't check ages all too well, and I can name a few mods who aren't old enough to play the game, let enough be a member of staff. Finally, the banning system in this game (when it works) is highly flawed. A few people have been banned innocently, but the game company refuses to hear your quarrels, as it has a policy of not contacting people on banned accounts. Have fun watching all that money get sucked away!  VERDICT: Waste of memory, this game had so much potential under EA (something rarely said) but the company who created this went bankrupt, and RELOADED products sucks. Don't get the game, it's a waste of time and memory- with nearly 550 hours on it I should know. I'll give this game a rating of 2/10, with lag spikes and hacks breaking gameplay, with a poor out of game support system too.
177	0	a	Now don't get me wrong, this game is absolutely wonderful, been playing this damn game for a few years now. So this is more of a reluctant unrecommended review. But anyways I'm pretty sure some other reviewer can fill you in better in the good stuff, so I think it's unecessary to talk about the areas where APB shines brightly with ease. So let me briefly cut to the chase.   What I dislike about the game:    Matchmaking is so bad it's laughable.   It's usually you or the opposition who is getting their arses kicked in the corner. A little less than occasionally there is a fair fight and well that's where the real thrill comes from it.    'I knew it, i'm surrounded by â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.'   [Kudos to anyone who knows this quote] Trolls, Griefers, and Cheaters are pretty common around the servers.[Or perhaps i'm just unlucky?]   Golden Cash-Cows  If you see someone with Gold Status, chances are they're premium wh**es armed to the teeth with premium guns, rocket launchers, and impossible superior accuracy[Hacker?].   Ridiculous Real Prices  $50+ for your average/op virtual gun. $100+ for a friken tommygun. lol wut? I know that it's a free to play game, they have to get compensation, and I fully understand that. But ffs.   The small yet completely noticeable holes in customization  While there are nearly limitless possibilites of customization in the game, little things like gender/faction only clothing is so ridiculous it's annoying. I mean seriously? They have licensed vigilanties protecting San Paro and exterminating 'criminals' wielding automatics and rocket launchers, when it's CLEARLY the police and military's job, but a woman can't wear men-like clothing or look like a tomboy? One word, 'Why?'   What it says in the description.     'Constantly evolving gameplay and events, with new content added regularly'   Now that's a lie when I see one. Okay, yes they are in fact adding content, but really, it's usually just a small 'fix', or some stupid limited-time weapons and customization items that nobody really knows or cares about. And I may not know much about the videogame developing world, but I think it would be very.....VERY wise to prioritise actually FIXING the game instead of just force feeding us this money grubbing bullsh*t. Now I don't care about the money grubbing because lets face it, everyone is unfortunately starting to it. F*cking Rockstar, is also doing it with it's stupid GTA: Online project. Oh yeah btw that reminds me, WHERE THE F*CK ARE THE HEISTS!? -sigh- The point is, fix your crap up FIRST, THEN advertise how greedy your company's wallet is.   The Publisher: Gamersf*ckingfirst  They're horrible at their job. Customer service is stupidly horrible, they are ALWAYS coming up with these annoying ideas of creating overpriced items and services to get your hard-earned money and let the rich little a-holes who pay, dominate us, and they just bring the cute little irony monster out with their cancer building name.   In conclusion?  Despite the mentioned, I actually still suggest trying this game out if you're an experienced fps/3rdps or at least have a good aim. If you do not have any of these qualities, I still recommend trying APB: Reloaded out, the thing is what I have to say to you is that you should not expect too much and double check on what you're getting into.
178	0	a	APB... was a great idea and game when it came out but at this point 5/4/2014 this game is competey other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, your better off playing some thing else. every thing this game had is gone, any game gamefist takes over turns to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. i dont think most ppl will read this but it is NOT worth the download. however it was before gamer fist got it and are milkin it, they do the less work as they can possable to do to keep ppl buging...thats all they do, there has been really NO no content since the game started... 4 or so years later... same game, alot more unstable, alot less ppl...
179	0	a	If you're going to play this, you're going to have a baaad time.  If you do pay with real money though you can go really well! If you go Enforcer you're going to win 90% of the time :D  And hey, maybe you won't rage at how unfair and unbalanced the whole damn game is you MAY get a little kick out of it.
180	0	a	Spent about 10 minutes trying to get this game to work on my computer. Won't launch at all, unless you count an irritating Facebook popup. Complete failure to launch for a game that by all reports has serious connectivity issues and a questionable business model. Coupled with a game that wants me to essentially disable the functionality in windows that allows my security software to function, and I could not reccomend this to anyone.
181	0	a	A pretty terrible game, it's got a major pay-to-win System, the anti-cheat system is awful and affects other games, the company is super greedy, and the overall game is buggy.  The customization is fun and the guns are great, but not well balanced.
182	0	a	(For all of you looking at my 600 hours, I actually have 1000+).  Let me begin by saying that this is a one-of-a-kind MMO that I fell in love with the first time I was allowed into the closed beta. The games character customization blew me away, and quickly became my favorite part of the game, and to this day is the only thing I genuinely care about in terms of APB's overall content.   Combat is a different story. I can't even consider it to be combat much more than I consider it to be dancing. There's just a huge learning curve to this game. Back in the day, people use to jump and snipe. It was the most stupidest thing ever designed into a shooter. The game feels to be a bit ridiculous sometimes, that I just up and quit after about an hour. Along with that, I have a short list of complaints in my head with this game, and I'll just point have you read them here.   1: The community can be sort of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to new players. Even I at once would badger these 13 year old kids who barely found out what a microphone was, but I learned that it didn't help with anything, except maybe my ego. There are so many new players who just get put down by all the grizzled veterans that they see no reason to continue playing this god-forsaken game, and they would be pulling a smart move. There is a huge lack of motivation to stay in the game, unless of course you meet certain people that you can have a good time with. Even then however, the game makes it very hard to maintain a positive attitude.  #2: I use to part of a team of testers known back in the day as SPCI. It was a group picked by individuals who cared for the game, and also its testers. I admit I didn't do as much as others, but I was there when it came to the problems we faced. For one, whenever an upcoming patch needed testing, sometimes we were limited to only a day to do it. Now for most people, they couldn't test every day of the week, even me. Whoever could took a huge load of work. Once bugs and critical elements were reported, we'd expect G1 to be on top of these reports and fix them. This never ever happened in my experience. Sometimes these bugs wouldn't be addressed for months, sometimes never. It was this lack of action that made a lot of us question if what we were even doing was being appreciated. Eventually it all fell apart. Now there is a new team, whom I don't know, that either care about the game, or just want in on the upcoming content. In layman's terms, the new team to me feels like a bunch of complacant slaves who just want to have some 'imaginary' form of authority in the APB community. So yeah, G1 just needed people to test the game so that they could say they have a test team, and that's it. So far, they don't seem to care.   #3: This game is filled with people who use third-party software to get an advantage in the game (wallhacks, aimbots, etc). Not a single day goes by where I can play and all the opposing players play legit. Most of the time you can tell when your playing excellent players, sometimes it's a very thin line between legit and illegit. It's this thin line that makes people 'hackusate' even legit people, and it even gets legits banned. And even when the illegitimates get banned, there's no preventing them from being able to reroll. They'll just come back to rage-hack and continue being their immoral selves.   #4: This game will bring out the worst in you. It doesn't matter how much willpower you have, how much of a paragon/angel you are. This game will break you, no question. Most of the time, it's this reason people result in becoming illegitimates, because they either want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on people, or because they don't want to spend the time to get better at something, and will use shortcuts to get their way. For people like me, who take it day by day, it is a struggle we endure for reasons even we don't really know. Maybe we hope for a day when the game will become what we always dreamed it to be. Maybe it's because we invested so much of our time into this game, we can't bare to let it go. The game has introduced me to some really good people, some of whom are good friends that I've known for years now. It's people like them that I wish filled the game, but sadly, the game is full of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, give or take a few.   #5: The Grind is very VERY real in this game. It is literally a requirement that you have premium from the get-go if you even want to finish this game in a relatively quick amount of time, and unless you like me, who wants to spend nearly 600 hours of gametime getting to R195, your gonna want premium. I have a 1000+ hours on my main character, and he's only 246 at the moment. In the near future, when contacts need even more repect points from you, I might just die of old age.  #6: Teamwork is something that people in this game ignore, which is funny, because it is literally the only thing that wins matches. Playing with a bunch of randoms does not help you in the slightest. Playing with people you know, people your on a voice chat with, is going to win you more games than just immitating a headless chicken (literally running in like a moron, with no strategic plan). So if your going to play this game, make friends fast, or get friends to play with you, so that you can get somewhere rather than nowhere.   In conclusion, this game has a great concept, but it's maintained by a bad company, who's only reason for buying it was to milk the living crap out of it. You'll notice really quick that this game has very little content push, and more flashy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with an expensive price tag on all of it. The clothes I like, but the guns and cars are G1's main source of income. Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like had this game gone back to subscription based playing. I'd compare it to FFXIV, and say that more content would be added rather than ARMAS market items. In a way, I probably would have done subsciption over F2P. But it was never my call to begin with, so for now, I just go with the flow.   My score - 2/5   I still have high hopes for APB, but until then, I am not going to recommend it because it's not fun once the raging begins. If your really willing to punish yourself, learn from your mistakes, and learn to laugh at them as well, because your going in for one hell of a rollercoaster ride.   Word of warning: Be prepared to get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on when you play.   On a side note, they should add some PVE to this game. Would help me relax a bit.  Along with that, enforcer activities (raiding a den, gathering intel, arresting drug dealers, etc.)
183	0	a	This game is just no for now maybe gettin better in the Future...try for yourself you will see D:
184	0	a	Me: ggwp A player on the enemy team: stfu â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  This game is worse than cancer
185	0	a	Worst game I've ever played. Performance issues everywhere.
186	0	a	 Be aware i did not 'only' play 900 hours, i just used the regular G1 launcher the whole last year. 1500 hours would be more exact.   I also paid something like 350 â‚¬ over the past 3 years and i abandonned everything because this game isn't worth it anymore.  I deleted my previous review which has been written the 11th of december 2011 stating that the game was great.      'APB: reloaded' or the 'Ultimate money making machine'  
187	0	a	Remember when K2 Network wasn't a bad company? Me neither.  0/10  Bad netcode, pay2win and boring.
188	0	a	Used to be oke. then the EdgeLords came and ruined the game TriHard Cx Scuffed Jays Watermelon tykisha.
189	0	a	I love what this game could have been. Pros: - Fantastic customization  - Some fun concepts  Cons: - Repetitive and boring quests - Performance is poor - A 'Toxic' community - The definition of pay2win (Very strong weapons locked behind pay walls) - A good portion of players hacked the game when I was playing - Developers that just don't seem to care at all about any of the present issues  The reason I played such a long time was because I met a really good group of friends in game.We made our own fun and just screwed around most of the time. It's a shame that the game turned out the way it did.I know I would have loved it if it wasn't so incredibly broken and neglected.  Don't waste your time on this game ,because the devs sure haven't put any of theirs into it.
190	0	a	As a beginner, I tried to ask for help but sadly in-game if you don't know what you're doing, they trashtalk you, instead of helping, And yeah, this game has a bad community.
191	0	a	its good but not optimized very well, for this reason i do not recommend this game
192	0	a	Doesn't feel finished, unfinished, pay to win, crap. Save yourself the disk space, unless you're really desparate.

196	0	a	This game.........you want to love playing it..........you really do, and dat first, it seems like you can actually be good at this game, but then you run into the gold players..........the ones who have all the best equipment, bought straight from the dev's, paying real money to have a significant advantage over everyone else, and it doesnt matter that you are at the bottom of the chain here, a bronze level player, they can just come right down and play against you, making it impossible for you to win a single mission. Then there are the hackers, they are out there, for sure. Aimbot is a definite obstacle, so for now, I say dont waste your time playing this, the game was a great concept, I still wanna play it, but until something is done about balance, about pay to win players, and about hackers, I cant even look at APB anymore....... R.I.P APB, i can only imagine what you could have been...........
197	0	a	This game used to be awesome. Keywords are 'used to'. Now it's just a circlejerk of hackers, rerollers - experienced players who make new characters 'cos can, troll characters - characters that are meant to look as hideous as possible, and a company that does a really poor job of not only getting rid of the hackers - they usually just ban innocent players - but making the game run well. It runs on an outdated engine and is poorly optimized. I have state-of-the-art hardware in my computer, and even with the graphics turned up to the fullest there is still aliasing, texture and animation problems. The company who owns this game, GamersFirst - they didn't make the game, but instead revived it from the company who originally created the game but had to shut down for some reason, can't even make good content for the game. The last, like, four weapons they've added have been reskins of existing weapons. But these ones you can only get by spending REAL MONEY to get, and it's not cheap either. Permenant weapons for a single character are forty dollars. FORTY DOLLARS. I could buy a completely new game with that.  The thing this game does well at is the customization, my God is it amazing... Only if you are a wizard at making symbols; otherwise you look absolutely stupid. The designers for symbols and themes - you can make a five second tune, usually an ear-piercing screech, that someone hears when you kill them or become MVP - aren't the most user friendly, and because of that there are only a handfull of people who can decently make them.  The gameplay is really repetitive and grindy; do the objectives and shoot the bad guys. The objectives don't mean crap, though. You can do all the objectives, but if you don't kill anyone you get barely anything. You level up at a snail's pace unless you, or course, spend REAL MONEY to get Premium, which allows you to get insane bonuses - something like 200% - to money and experience incomes.   I started playing this game right around the time it came out, and it was fun for a while, but for the past year the only thing that has kept me playing is the hope that GamersFirst would do SOMETHING to fix this crap-heap of a game. I would not reccomend you play it. If you do play it, however, do NOT spend any money on this game - it's dying, and fast.
198	0	a	once you run out of missions it is really bad
199	0	a	Stephen Hawking runs bettr then this game
200	0	a	Dying game, small community left of pay to win kids, unless you plan on getting hooked into spending close to 100$ (as everyone who is 'successful') I suggest not even downloading this game  even IGN wouldn't give this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a 5
201	0	a	APB Reloaded is a cops and robbers MMO that couldn't quite pull it off. The game has SO much potential that it almost makes me angry when they fall short on almost every game features. The lack of locational damage means accuracy is not needed. Combat often ends in a jumping match, and corner camping is one of the few strategies thanks to the third person camera.   The games micro transaction system and F2P model are majorly flawed. When buying guns in game you rent them allowing you to use it for a set amount of time before you have to rent it again. Buying an account bound weapon costs more but allows any of your characters to use it. This will run you anywhere from 20-55 dollars. You can also purchase character bound weapons for less, these cost about 10-40 dollars. When buying cars you can do the same rent, or own. An account bound car will run you about 15-35 dollars.   All of these prices can be discounted by owning a premium subscription.  Other premium benefits include a 20% off the cost of premium subscriptions, up to a 90% bonus to all Contact Standing (XP) Gains, 125% bonus to all Cash gains, 20% discount in the Armas Marketplace, 50% reduced cool down on activated abilities (Field Supplier / Nitro Booster), advanced access to Customization Suites (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. 100 layers per Symbol), removal of in-game premium subscription advertising (which pops up at the end of every other mission), extended duration for Armas Trials for Weapon and Vehicle Trials.  Premium costs about 10 dollars for 30 days and gets cheaper the more time you buy. All in game prices are set in G1C which come in inconvenient amounts to make you buy more or additional packs. An example of this is a non-premium 1 month subscription costs 999 points. You can only get 999 points by buying spending $15 (1200 credits) because $10 is only 800 credits.  The best part of this 3rd person MMO shooter is the customization. While it is extremely limited as a non-premium user you can still add some flavor to your character or vehicle. Premium allows for you to create a truly unique look with 50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. At 100 layers per Symbol.   The in game missions are not over exciting and after playing for about 2-3 hours you will have played all of the available missions. Other players not in your mission are still in the world and can interact with you. They can do things like ram your vehicle or block you in buildings, but it is difficult for them to directly kill you.  The favored anti-cheat system of APB is Punkbuster. This program doesn't work very well at all and allows hackers to run rampant. In my short amount of play time I had encounter roughly 1 hacker per hour.  Overall this game has such a great idea, yet such terrible terrible execution in nearly everything the developers tried to do. 
202	0	a	Horrendous player community that puts Dota and CounterStrike to shame if you're lower than 100+ ranks you're likely to get kicked from a lot of parties instantly, rampant with cheaters and pay2win real money store weapons, cars handle like boats on ice, the servers are Laggy with huge ping spikes regularly with little to no moderation, the game is poorly optimized leading to giant frame drops and a hugely outdated Unreal engine.  Uses punkbuster of all programs too as it's anti-cheat so expect to get banned for having windows volume mixer open while genuine cheaters laugh their way to free wins in every match undetected.
203	0	a	As you can see, I've spent TONS of hours on this game. I loved it and I think it's an AWESOME concept for a game, but sadly, as time went by, the game turned more and more into a toxic waste. The community is cancer, the P2W is unbearable, and the devs are the biggest ***holes in the gaming industry. I have to say though, if you have a good group of friends or even if you can find a cool clan to join up with in game, the game is an ABSOLUTE blast. Again, you'd need to be able to stand hackers and p2w features out the Wahoo but it's an enjoyable ride once you get the hang of it and accept the fact you're gonna get pummeled as a noob.
204	0	a	Grind fest with tons of hackers.
205	0	a	Just suck.
206	0	a	As a start,sure it is an interesting game.After a few days it gets repetitive.From missions to customizations and so on. The game itself has a great base.Criminals against the Police,a great idea.Were the game starts to break down it is in it's execution,and the outside.In the trailers you can see that it's possible to make artwork with the creation tools.Well,yes you can,but you will soon see that it's limited,only an amount of geometric shapes you can use,same to the cars,clothes etc. One of the things that killed me is that everything was limited.I put a lot of money in this because I had hope. The matches are stupidly done.I couldn't play because it wasn't fair.They put 2 dudes with rank over 20,against 2 with over 10. The only thing that counts as 'fair' is how many people vs how many people.I couldn't level up,only if I was very good at it,and I wasn't.It's the same thing,even if you are a cop or a criminal.Criminal:Go and rob something,steal a car,go to a point,capture a point,protect a point or just transport an object without the cops seeing you.Cop:Go and stop the criminals from doing all that. There is no easy way of making money since the matches are soooo unfair.Only one way and it's only for criminal(sorry cops). It's basically destroying with your car shops windows.It's a boring way,but it's worth it.The shops will drop a few objects that you have to pick up and put in a car.Then go to an AI and give the stuff,after that go to another place to get the money for it.This way I made about 20-30k a day,but again it was getting boring. I found that one thing was funny,was playing with your friends,it has a massive multiplayer.So I was actually having fun,even if I was dead or alive. The game itself has a hidden wall in front of it.It doesn't let you pass that much,most of the cool things are either for premium or they are hard to get,and only if you are good.I am not saying that you cannot get good items without paying or premium,if you are good,you can get cool items.But it's really hard to get good.When I say good I mean 'super good'. The game also has clans,I had one but it was pretty dumb and lame.You can make a icon for the clan and spray it on special spots in the city.And it is true that you can actually make songs.I found myself creating a lot of music,so that will be fun. This game has a short amount of 'gamemodes'.There are two cities,they are basically the whole game.Then there's these 2 place from both cities,where there is like a 'free for all' gamemode,and the famous 'Hanging Plaza'.Where you create,buy,and sell. In a nutshell this game needs a lot of improvement.It is fun,but you will find it anoying after a while.So it does not worth your time.You can try playing it a few hours,but that's all.You will get bored.I must say that the game is full of glitches and bugs so watch out for that,some are funny,but some aren't.Even after many laughs it will started sucking your soul and just turn into a pain in the leg.Don't bother with putting any money in it.Play for a while and if you aren't 'super good' at it,just delete the game,it will get repetitive and you will get nervous because you can't killed anybody(because all over 20).If you aren't good at beating people that have over your rank,just leave it. In the end this game is something that should'va been developed by someone else.Someone who actually knows how to make a multiplayer game.If you haven't played the game,just try it and the play something else.I played it too much,I was frustrated that I wasn't killing anybody.Warning!YOU WILL NEED A GOOD COMPUTER! If you are reading my review,just don't touch it.It doesn't worth your time,go and play GTA or Saints Row instead of this thing. So this game gets the rating of 3/10,an epic fail.The idea is good,they screwed it up.Now it's just a stupid,frustrating game that gets a lot of bad reviews.After a spoiler that it will be gta 5,and a few changes of title,all developted by someone who doesn't know how to make games like this.This is what you get,you get 'A.P.B.:Reloaded'. And if you say 'Changes of title?'.Yes,the game was once called 'All Points Bulletin''(A.P.B.).There was no 'Reloaded'.Go google and get more indepth informations about the past game.I don't know that much about it. SO GO AND BUY OTHER GAMES,EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS FREE,GO AND PLAY GTA:SA INSTEAD OF THIS CRAP!
207	0	a	Bah, I played this, Got really good with my arrests, and was banned because I got reported to many times for using the LTL weapons all the time. Arrests get you the most money and points, and they are pretty easy to use, But you will get banned for using them as you primary all the time in Fight Club, Shame, I spent a pretty penny on this game as well, I was a Closed beta tester, I fell in love with the customizations and the idea this game was going for.
208	0	a	Never have I hated a game so much but enjoy it at the same time.  This game is literally AIDs but it is so addictive and I find myself going back to it so many times.  If you enjoy lifeless worlds, horrible driving, imbalanced weapons, a cancerous 'community' and glitchy gameplay this game is a must. Otherwise, don't even bother. The character customisation isn't even worth it.
209	0	a	a waste of time.
210	0	a	Its really Bad Game !   really bad really bad !
211	0	a	you pay alot to get good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ or you can get gta v with that money.
212	0	a	  Feels like this game is really hungry for money
213	0	a	The game starts out great you can ride with your friends stealing or protecting and then IT haappens the pay2win you join a match eryone is the same lvl and the otther team has maxed out everything best armor,cars,guns and then the actual system(im looking at you punkbuster) Kicks you because it basically wanted to. Finding allies is hard the only thing you can do later on is really hide in a corner till your character commits suicide
214	0	a	This game sounds interesting, but matching system is totally BROKEN. You will force matched lv50ish veterans in first ten minuites and got bullied AGAIN AND AGAIN. Do not play this. ------------------- ãƒžãƒƒãƒãƒ³ã‚°ã¶ã£å£Šã‚Œã¦ã‚‹ã›ã„ã§ã€ãƒ™ãƒ†ãƒ©ãƒ³å‹¢ã«ãƒœãƒƒã‚³ã•ã‚Œã¾ã™ã€‚
215	0	a	Although this game has lots of potential, I myself have found a few things wrong with it:  Firstly, the game is simply too resource-demanding. I myself have an Alienware 14 with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M, and 8GB of memory. To start with, this $1,000 laptop barely even runs this game on moderate graphics settings, forcing me to switch to low-end graphics just so the game can have a smooth, playable framerate. MAYBE this is something wrong with my laptop, but I think not.  Even playing on the lowest graphics settings possible, the game still manages to lag and otherwise have random FPS drops that would often result in instant death in the middle of a firefight. The vehicle control feels a little too arcade-y for my liking. In addition, there is a rather alarming population of cheaters on servers. Utilizing a mathematical formulaâ€”100 missions played, averaging 4 players to each faction for each missionâ€”I found that over the course of those 100 missions that a total of 89 people were hacking in some way, shape, or form. If we conclude that in 100 missions that you will encounter 700 people (800 minus yourself in each mission), there is an average hacker ratio of 0.127 (12.7%). While Reloaded Production's newest Fair Fight Anti-Cheat Technology should help reduce this number, I still can see a large population of hackers managing to bypass this.  Regarding the servers, their software is outdated and faulty at best. Only the dedicated servers seem to run anywhere near smoothly, but even then their calculation systems and arithmatic formulas often result in a laggy experience.  Pros:  Decent graphics Dynamic gameplay ENDLESS character customization  Cons:  Requires a high-end gaming laptop in order to run smoothly Arcade-esque vehicle handling Combat utilizes hit-scans, which often bugs Outdated servers High hacker population  Overall score: 5.1/10.  This game USED to be fun, but sadly, they have moved away from their original roots of entertainment. The best that I can say about it is that it is merely a laggy, ramped-up version of cops-and-robbers that we all played as little kids. If you are looking for a decent F2P game, I would advise you to look elsewhere.
216	0	a	A prime example of a great concept that is run into the ground by profiteering â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.  The Pay-to-win aspect besides, the gameplay is extremely repetitve and is basicly a deathmatch third-person shooter with cops vs robbers theme. The only redeeming aspect about this game is it's customization, which is yet to be matched by any other game. Just pretend you're playing Playstation Home and you're all good to enjoy this game.
217	0	a	I played this game for a long time, awhile back I was banned for absolutely no reason. I contacted support and they told me that they couldn't tell me why I was banned and to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off basically. So â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the company that made this game, I hope that this game goes to a company that actually wants to make a game and not milk it for everything it's worth.
218	0	a	This used to be my favourite game but now it's terrible. Every time I decide to come back and have some fun with it like the good old day it reminds me how much I hate this game. It's so broken it can't be fixed. Believe me I know G1 tried but they made it worse. I won't even start the P2W topic and the fact that there are many hackers that just don't get banned because they bought some G1 credits.
219	0	a	Until they fix all the issues, which are A LOT, don't play it... Just don't... Please.
220	0	a	This game, is an ok game to be free to play, good weapons, outfits, vehicles, missions, all of that is good. But I have to say, this game is just too overated.
221	0	a	Mixed feelings about this game. If you've spent enough time on it, it's a great expereince. But if you're a little impatient, and don't like the very repetetive stuff, I would not recommend it.

225	0	a	It's not a bad game, but it's anything but good. The driving is annoying, the gunplay is nothing spectacular, and the AI is crappy (this is the best word I can think to describe it as).  All this is a pay-to-win mediocre cop vs robber game that's not really all that fun and could really use some major fixes and fine-tuning to mechanics.  However, because it is free, give it a try and see for yourself - some people actually enjoy these kind of shooters, so you might as well. 5/10
226	0	a	The concept of this game is really cool. Its kinda like a GTA online shooter, its completly open world and the customization possibilities are HUGE! You can literally create everything for your character!   A big downside of this game is the ingame shop. Im playing at gold rank without any premium stuff and weapons and 90% of my opponents are just people with premium to get more money and Golden Weapons with max Upgrades from the store. Not having these can make the game very frustrating since your opponents will just be stronger in any way without much skill. They reg Health faster, their weapons deal more dmg, their accuracy is higher. For example there is a premium SHOTGUN, that hits you for almost full dmg without being in melee combat, which is highly frustrating to play against. This is just an example.   The principle of the game is still fun, but the P2W model ruins it a lot in my opinion.
227	0	a	I thought it wasn't any good out of ten i would give it a 1 because you have to make a account first. Plus it is saints row but rubbish so my opinion is just get GTA or Saints row, they are better because APB is cheap you can't do half the things you can in GTA.PLease don't get it. this is my experience and you would know what I mean.

I played it long before it went F2P and not all the time I played the F2P version is recorded on Steam. Pay 2 Win cash shop policy and more often than not infested by hackers, and even if nobody hacked it would still be camp 2 win.
243	0	a	Fun game the first hour or two, after that its pretty much aids. Since Gamersfirst like any other F2P companies decided to make the game P2W and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up the matchmaking system, its pretty much just a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ to play.  Customization is the only good thing about this game atm.  3/10, since the graphics are pretty ok.

245	0	a	For the 1st and 2nd day this was a great game to play by myself and with friends. However over time this game started to slip away from the fun side. The game was full of tryhards, and I could see it was a pay to win because of this I started to feel less pumped about the game. I started to think 'Am I back in call of duty?'. However I continued playing the game as I liked large amounts of it and that I'm not one to just turn my back on a game due to some 'errors'. Then on the 3rd or 4th day (after being stressed out from everyday life) I logged in to have a whale of a time only to find a lovely message 'account blocked/ error 10008'. After looking online I found many people have got this due to so called 'cheating'. I have not cheated. So why am I blocked from this game! I'm not saying people don't cheat but People have been playing the game for thousands of hours and kicked due to just playing the damn game! Some people have just got the game and blocked before they had even started playing the game. Sounds fishy? I also have problems logging onto they're website and I feel like I have wasted 44 hours. 44 hours I'm not getting back! I feel sorry for the people who have spent hundreds of hours on this! So no, I don't recommend this game. Sorry APB Reloaded but never again will I play your games or recommend this game to anyone else. Thank you to anyone who spent there time to read this and thank you to the people who have made and helped keep this game running for the hours of fun I have had but I think I'm ganna stick to the games that care about they're players.   From your little friend MÐ„Æ ÆœÆ“Æ ÆŠÈ¤
246	0	a	I was once inlove with this game,but now i'm dissapointed  this game started became â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ every patch, hacker everywhere,the game is laggy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I can't believe i throw into this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. R.I.P APB RELOADED it was fun while it last. If you're ready to get your asskick and kill by hacker with no recoil shooting or 1 hit kill then be my guest go play this game. good luck. My final verdict for this game is 1/10.
247	0	a	Game was going fine for a moment, until PunkBuster decides to kick me out of the district for no reason.   Uninstalling this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I knew that this game is not good yet.  0/10 because PunkBuster is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

249	0	a	Great game concept, but plagued by extreme P2W and infested with cheaters and Brazillians.   Stay clear.
250	0	a	Its a good game but dont work at windows 8. But if you got it to work plz tell me
251	0	a	this is my dong wrapped in paper
252	0	a	A pretty below average game in my honest opinion. It not only uses an old Unreal Engine, but has many limits, in terms of draw distance, fake bloom effects and jagged shadows.  Even while having a powerful rig, this game will still run poorly, which may also explain the decreasing numbers of people playing the game. I know people who have played this years ago and are no longer able to handle the game due to terrible performance.  Theres a poor choice of missions in this game such as: Defuse bomb, Ramming, Stealing which is basically all a click 'f' to wait while this circle fills up to 100% and offers no challenge whatsoever.  However, props to RTW for creating a game with such amazing customization, like i've never seen before, and may be the only reason why i play this.
253	0	a	Don't believe the people who say that this isn't a pay to win game.  Someone who has played this for about 2-3 years will still fall behind someone who spent $100+ and only months (sometimes weeks) in this game. After logging in almost 500 hours in this game I can say that it does get really repetitive. I gave up around the time hackers ruled the servers. Even with this new system out I'm very hesistant to go back.  Cusomization is nice.. only if you pay for extra slots.  Seriously unless you're the trophy wife or gay secret lover of Bill Gates who will willingly give you lots of money, I don't suggest spending a dime on this.
254	0	a	10/10 game , couldnt even start it
255	0	a	Do not get this game. The pathetic makers of this game will not allow you to play this game unless you have a graphics card that meets their requirements! After waiting for the game to fully download, register to play, then the installer install the game, I found out I couldnt play the game just because my computer didnt fit their expectations, pathetic! Not buying a product from this compnay and I suggest you follow the same, if I want to play a game, and download it, it should not stop me from playing it
256	0	a	This mmo is totally unbalanced, and is pay to win. I don't recommend it.
257	0	a	-Pay to win -Crappy vehicle controls -Physics suck  -Unclear for new players -Literally nothing to do  TLDR I want a refund and the game's free.
258	0	a	Pay to win, no other words.
259	0	a	The game in it's current state, I definitely cannot recommend. It has some pretty awesome customization, but thats honestly about all that keeps me coming back. The matchmaking is terrible, and there has only been cash shop item releases (no new real content) since G1 took over. They say proper new content will be possible once they finish the engine upgrade, but they've been promiseing the upgrade for 3+ years and it still seems it'll never be here. They also plan to overhaul the matchmaking system, which will definitely help keep new players around, as the system they have in place now is often exploited by veterans, and will end up matching them against newbies. With the fairly steep and long learning curve the game has, few will stick around to get the hang of it after getting steamrolled constantly.  tl;dr I would recommend this game once the matchmaking has been overhauled, and the engine upgraded, but in it's current state, it's skippable.
260	0	a	Nice game and pretty fun to play for a while, but just as any f2p,the game does have some serious issues. In the case of apb,it's the balancing of the 2 factions,enforcers and criminals (=pigs and crims). While criminals are really fun to play,enforcers get a huge advantage over them by being able to 'witness them' and pretty much 2shot them (the combat mechanics of the game are: hold down your mousebutton,the one with the better weapon or first hit will win.)  The problem here is that the notoriety system of the game lets the pigs witness any criminal with a high enough rating. This gives cops a huge combat advantage,since you can't shoot cops as crim unless they witness you and start shooting.   If you dont mind balancing and serious hacker issues,you'll have a fun time,especially when playing with some mates.
261	0	a	This game is cancer.
262	0	a	AHAHAHHAHAH CPTJACKACE WE WILL GET YOU  REMOVE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ REMOVE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ FROM PREMISE
263	0	a	It sucks. You can't even get past the tutorial and you basically do what you do in gta.  You drive drugdealer and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s over, just that you get no money. You shoot other people for fun.  Its funless, pointless oh and the Character Creating is half way broken.
264	0	a	 If you enjoy grinding consistently for months/years and forking out Hundreds to Thousands of dollars a year for a premium membership and/or Pay2Win weapons, then this game was made specifically for YOU.
265	0	a	1st take - If you're not willing to spend real money it is pretty much unplayable. Hacking,macro cheating, and golds purposely farming lowbies galore. Maybe if G1 got their act togethor i would say its a worthwhile game...but they're making to much money off the p2w guns to even care.  2nd take - Fairfight solved some of the hacker problems, but i still would not recommend this game yet. Only good thing going for it at the moment is the sheer amounts of customization. But there is still to many glaring problems that needs to be addressed.  1.Matchmaking - The matchmaking in this game is atrocious, it makes leagues matchmaking system look flawless ( and thats bad) . Odds are you will be placed against people who are gold and R255 while you are just starting out. (even if you go to bronze servers they're still there)  2. Armas Weapons - This is the big one, Armas weapons is a double edged sword. Yes it is whats keeping the game afloat since it brings in revenue. But also its whats making the game completely unbalanced. Though i would think this could be easily fixable by adding ranks to the armas weapons, so a brand new character cant run around with a shaw 'first blood'.  3. This ties into 1, but the fact golds can stay in bronze servers. This could be easily fixed that once you hit gold you are automatically booted out of the server.  4.They need to find a way to hire actual GM's , cause there's is a load of people who need to banned just for the way they act in this game. If players were actually afraid of losing all their work and the real money they spent on armas. Maybe the community would be less toxic.  These are only some of the problems, maybe after these are fixed i could actually approve this game to new players.
266	0	a	Why do people enjoy this game? What qualities of this game are attractive in any way, shape, or form? I want to know. I really do.
267	0	a	This game is what would happen to GTA if Rockstar was feeled with ****ing vegatables
268	0	a	The most annoying game I ever played for 4 hours the driving is annoying and the shooting and the constant crashing!

270	0	a	FreeToPlay GTA... With bugs,bad optimisation,graphics,money greedy... Go away already..
271	0	a	APB Reloaded is the same game as APB: All Points Bulletin, so if you did play it then and liked it then you will like it now. Behind all the good customization locked behind premium membership you find the bad combat that made it emerge as a F2P tittle in the first place. What made players leave in the first place is still there, what made players stay is still there tough whatever that was I cant see. This game should have stayed dead and burred, it was supposed to be GTA online because thats what we wanted and its not. Worth a try for the customisation alone, not worth staying for the combat for any amount of time.
272	0	a	While the graphics are good, it lacks in storyline and general flow. Nothing is really clear when you start the game, the map is confusing. Character Customization is good when you first start but if you want to customize further in the game with things such as weapons, or clothing then its very difficult and expensive. Combat is one-sided, with you being the lesser side and rather often dying and you're always resurrected way back at the beginning where you first started. Its gets a bit easier if you are playing it with friends but not that much. All in all out of 10, I'd give it about 4/10.
273	0	a	I haven't played this using steam but over my two accounts I have over 1500 hours and it spans from 2011-2013 , and then rest of my second account is all from late 2014 to 2015.  The game had a lot of potential but the increasingly poor decisions of the people in charge are really putting the nail in the coffin as time goes on. The game was playable and enjoyable, FPS was good and there wasn't any lag. The game has cheaters but what F2P game doesn't?   Then as time goes on you lost FPS with every patch, you can no longer play on ultra settings but need to play it on low with a special launcher that reduces textures even further, I have upgraded my rig since I've first started playing and the performance I get is absolutely laughable. The servers, for more than a month, have been having aboslutely awful connection problems due to getting 'ddosed' ( doubt it, probably just a lie) which result in constant ping spikes and people constantly teleporting around.  But as the game continues to go down the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you can guarantee there will still be sales on the Armas marketplace so they can try and squeeze every last penny out of you before you get fed up and leave because of sheer lack of progress, transparency, and GM's that actually play the game.  Save yourself the heartbreak, maybe if you could get in a time machine and play it early 2013 you would be happy, but the state it is in now is absolutely unplayable. It's sad to see what it has become, but it's just how it is when you have clueless fools in charge.
274	0	a	This game has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, however, that alone cannot save it. Although the premise of this game is great, and the customization is extremely in-depth, it simply has too many flaws to make it a good game.    The cash shop, or the 'Armas Marketplace' as it is known ingame, completely ruins any and all balance by releasing ridiculously overpowered weapons. *cough* VAS C2 Troublemaker *cough* The weapon mechanics in APB are EXTREMELY broken. Players using certain submachine guns can snipe players at long distance with ease. Also, there are no scopes worth mentioning on sniper rifles, which makes them worthless beyond 100 metres or so. This lack of sniping mechanics is further confounded with the lack of a head hitbox. This leads to, you guessed it, NO HEADSHOTS! This creates even less of a reason to use weapons besides submachine guns, because where you shoot makes no ABSOLUTELY no difference! Not to mention, the time to kill in this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ly low, you CAN and WILL die in a fraction of a second when a player pops around the corner using a VAS C2. Now that we've talked about the gameplay, we can talk about the community. APB's community is one of the most horrific, hate filled communities I have ever been a part of. Any time I log onto a district, the chat is filled with players endlessly cursing one another out and accusing players of hacking. Which brings me to my next point. Hackers are extremely prevalent in this game, and despite the presence of an 'anticheat' used by Reloaded Productions, it does next to nothing to dam the endless river of hackers flowing into this game. When you're not playing against hackers, APB's horrendous matchmaker will be SURE to match you against players three times your level, armed to the teeth with weapons and armored cars. This shouldn't be a problem, due to the so called 'x threat level' servers. The gold players are supposed to play on the gold servers, the silvers on the silver server, and so on. This however, does not happen. Gold players intentionally drop down to silver or bronze threat level, which allows them to run rampant on bronze servers and completely annhiliate the fresh new players, just leaving the tutorial.   In conclusion, I URGE you to avoid this piece of crap game, unless you're looking for a funny way to waste time, or have a fetish for bad games.

277	0	a	This game was honestly horrible in everyway. Hackers among just awful gameplay really made it a horrible game.
278	0	a	I like this game, don't get me wrong. It's fun and fast, very customizable and good to play in groups.   The biggest problem with this game, however, is the playerbase. You will be hard pressed to find a more venemous and hateful crowd of online personalities anywhere else. Frequent 'hackusations' and minors screaming over the VOIP service. Griefers and exploiters are also abound, this game brings out the 'do anything to win' in a lot of people.   There is also a form of racism in the game against anyone who is not a gold leve player, and then in the reverse, anyone who IS a gold player. This game is also plauged by a group of people who were probably banned for cheating or something, that come back to crash the servers and generally cause everyone else to be unable to play the game.   This game has a very steep learning curve, but once you get it, you spend a lot less time getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at your pixels and more time having fun... but not a lot more.
279	0	a	3 years ago probably one of the best games out there. NOW probably the worse one you can play if you play it for the shooting aspect. THE BAD #1 Get good with carbin or lose #2 Premium or die of old age #3 VERY toxic community (salty,tears,getgud,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥) typical vocabulary amongst #4 Porn #5 Animation canclation a thing #6 Seeing through certain walls (not fixed over years) #7 Unjust bans #8 cheat scripters not being banned? #9 very very lacking on updates #10 The more money you got (real cash) the more youl succeed -spent alot - notices difference   THE GOOD #1 Amazing customization #2 Good game to hang out with people #3 Car customization/Driving is awesome Thats it i give this game a big thumbs down - about 8K hours of game play over the past 5 6 years WORTH IT back then NOT WORTH it now .
280	0	a	Classical Pay2Win free2play game. Low fps even on a 6 core with a 7850 2GB. Definitely don't recommend playing.

283	0	a	Customization: 11/10 Gameplay: Meh.  If you enjoy painful grind, even more versus opponents that have end-game weapons like a spam-cuz-bad nade launcher, then dive head first into it. Because yes, this puts newbies versus experienced and geared-up players. 
284	0	a	Rife with aimbots and pay to win, it's unfortunate that those rather large issues are in the way of what could be an amazing game with all the levels of customization present. The grind is also approximately double what it should be. 500 hours will not even get you half way to the 'good' gear, unless you're subscribed.  There's an ongoing joke that 'GamersFirst' is actually 'MoneyFirst' because of their policies and inaction on issues in favor of monetizing strategies involving power and chance with the store.
285	0	a	Gotta love it when the game's first mission is to go up against people who have RPG's, sniper rifles, and LMGs.........just don't waste your time.

290	0	a	A completely different rig and 3 years of time, still no 'new engine' (announced 2013). Still hard-locking my PC and forcing me to restart... On a completely new PC...     *I will admit, it is a fun game to watch streamers get mad at people blatantly hacking when the devs are too busy banning kids for swastikas, boobs, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ decals on their cars/clothes.
291	0	a	Game is so unbalanced, you have gold level players playing on bronze servers, hackers everywhere,toxic community who will try and defend this game to the death, whiny people who whisper about reporting you and how they're going to 'hack you' and then block you, enforcers using less than lethal guns that are magical and can stun you in 2 seconds, the market place for this game is also terrible, if you want to pay2win it's expensive, with special guns that cost ~40$ to buy just buy forever on a single charcter, and chances are if you play this game enough you will get banned. Such a terrible game 0/10.
292	0	a	This game is A pay-to-win game, even after four years to make this game something worthwhile. Like i said, the only way to do good in this game is to dump your wallets out. Save yourself from a bad third-person shooter with bad animation, every gun is a recycled image, and if you dont spend some money, your stuck with crappy stuff. Dont get addicted, save your hard earned cash and buy GTA if you want something like this. Also it's a pain to drive any vehicle in this game and AI civilians run and scream even if you roll by at 5 mph and aren't even close to hitting them. Oh well, i guess we can keep on dreaming about that game that this used to be.
293	0	a	I spent ages playing this game on several different characters. It was fun, but after the security updates these people created, everything went wrong. You try to message the 'support' and nobody replies for ~15 days. I got banned for doing absolutely nothing, and when I tried to get my account back, I was told my account was found using 'malicious files'. Nobody had access to my account, I was getting banned for either being too good at times in the game (where people would report me for hacking when I wasn't) and the staff couldn't take a second to check my account and my files to see if I was actually doing anything. This community is filled with greedy people trying to get money from people and once they notice that certain people stop purchasing their G1 cash for a pay-to-win game, they stop caring about them. But hey, maybe you like this game. It became boring and repetitive anyway. Take it from someone who spent ~200 hours on the game on this account, it's not worth it. I've spent at least $150 on the game (and was gifted another $200, because my friends saw how I enjoyed this game), and in the end even after all the game time everything began to go downhill. The community, the staff, and the increased pay-to-win. Good luck if you still play, and try not to get banned for doing absolutely nothing wrong.   Edit 8/4/16:  I figured I would come back and see if anything was changed, and I wasn't as 'rusty' as I thought I would be. So I went and played around a bit for literally ~9 hours and got banned this morning. I contacted support requesting a refund for even the cheapest skateboard back accessory cause I am not dealing with anymore of this games bs.
294	0	a	you can only join missions and do missions it is fun for 20 minutes and thats it
295	0	a	If you like rocketlauncher battle world, you will like it. If you don't, then don't download this game. It's just a pay 2 win with brainless kids.

297	0	a	Pros: + Insane amount of customizations + Nice looking cars + Decent combat Cons: - Repetitive - Insane grind - Need real money to really enjoy the customization system - Bad lag during peak hours
298	0	a	G1 ruins the game.
299	0	a	Fun for a while... then it gets horrible. Go play GTA online, its much better.
300	0	a	The game isn't finished but the devs seem to think it is. Wait for it to get better before you start playing. That's my advice to you.
301	0	a	IM not playing no more they need match player with them same ranks and they need to kick all the hacker of the game.The game it not worst playing at All.All they care is your money not anything else.And they never respond to your complaints!!!!!!!!!
302	0	a	this game is imbalanced if you are free to play. the match making makes no sense, new players getting placed against players with rocket launchers (advanced weapons).  Rocket Launchers take away from the whole 'cop vs Criminal' aspect of the game. i tried to get into this game multiple times with friends. each time we got turned off when we were placed against players who had better guns/equipment against us.  never understood this method of FTP, it is designed to discourage playing the game free. but in the end all it did was discourage me from investing in it.
303	0	a	This game is premium grade-A sh!te. I made a character and was pretty much thrown into a world similar to the outraged chaos in GTA Online with no idea about where I was even supposed to begin. After hours of losing missions constantly to the criminals I decided to make one. I actually took my time with this character to make sure they looked exactly how I wanted them to, and when I went to create the character I was told I was disconnected from the server for an unknown reason and lost all of my progress. This game was a big waste of time, and I would not recommend it to the ones I care about.
304	0	a	Great ideas, awful implementation and balance. Not worth the headache.   Just play GTA4 or Saints Row with a friend for a way better experience.
305	0	a	This game was good when it was a subscription based game when it went free to play it turned into a Pay2Win crap.
306	0	a	A Dreadful P2Win game that isnt even remotley balanced. New players will find it damn near impossible to even go toe to toe with oposing faction. Server experiences frequent and crippling rubbanding lag.
307	0	a	if you even THINK about getting this i will find you
308	0	a	A fun game to goof around with friends on, but there are too many Pay-2-Play players and cheaters plauging the servers to have fun.
309	0	a	240% more unclear than running blind. Tutorial is crap, stock gun is crap, 3/4 of the game is worse.
310	0	a	Want to waste your time trying to do missions, only to be rolled by smurfs on -every- district of -every- server? Buy this now! There is no stopgap to allow you to level up or compete with the higher end players. they just destroy you.
311	0	a	This game is broken... I downloaded the game off the official website and it would not let me launch it up. So i deleted the files and downloaded it off steam and yet again would not let me play. So i tryed to delete it again and it would not let me, even now as i write this review it says im playing APB, but i'm not. I dont know if this a common problem but personaly i am pretty disapointed.
312	0	a	Alright.  So, in a world where GTA V/GTA Online had not yet existed, Realtime Worlds (the creator of, among other things, Crackdown) decided to break the bank on an MMOFPS called All Points Bulletin, or APB.  It was a highly ambitious but deeply flawed experiment in open-world GTA-esque sandbox gamplay in multiplayer. There were a number of serious flaws to the game's design, implementation and operation that gave it pretty lousy reviews, and in the end it was one of the reasons why Realtime Worlds went into bankruptcy.  After this escapade, a holding company bought out the rights to IP ownership and services administration of APB, which would eventually become known as GamersFirst (a highly ironic title for a game company that seemingly throws everything they can get their hands on into a pay-to-win woodchipper as soon as possible).  These guys seemingly haven't done a whole lot else with the game besides random bugfixes that in the end might have made it impossible to play on my computer, either through the retail launcher or via Steam.  But when I WAS able to play it, there was a nugget of intrique buried in a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ issues that prevented me from enjoying the game as a new player. The anti-cheat system was terrible, allowing for way too many impossible snipe-shots from other players in free-roaming or in missions, the community was pretty awful except for those who often hung out in the social servers (thus giving me an opportunity to entertain them by dancing like an idiot a few times, what MMOFPS fun) and player advancement was really meager as a result of how stratified the playerbase's levels of experience were.  To be fair though, there are some positives. The character/vehicle customization engine was mind-blowing at the time and is still pretty impressive today. If you can get together with people you know, you might enjoy causing havoc knowing that police dispatching is wholly reliant on the number of Enforcer players on the server and vice versa -- in other words, the world swings from one extreme to the other, chaos or dystopian order. It's pretty entertaining in that regard, I guess, although it's just a side effect of how unbalanced the game is.   Lastly, the missions I could get into were pretty entertaining in the world provided -- one of my favorite things about Realtime Worlds' open world games was the environment they designed for them. I don't exactly know why I enjoyed them, as they could be rather generic at times, but they always felt alive to me for some reason.   Maybe if a whole lot was changed about the game I'd consider going back to it (once I could ACTUALLY go back to it, as well) but in the meantime I'd not recommend this mediocre excuse for a massively multiplayer GTA. Now that GTA Online's out for PC, I'd suggest you check that out instead, its flaws are much more forgivable. It's weird that I can actually say that and mean it.
313	0	a	I have mixed feelings about APB. I appreciate that it's not another WoW-copy-paste McDonalds MMO, but I feel that some basic design decisions really hold this game back from being anything but frustrating. First of all, no story. I have no motivation to do squat in this game, other than 'just to kill people and get upgrades'. Second: pure PvP, and VERY imbalanced at that. There is no 'PvE' to speak of, and the PvP is absolutely lopsided, due in no small part to being able to BUY better weapons at EXORBENT prices. Almost all missions are PvP based, and the group finder has no problem pitting 2 players against 1, or 7 against 3 as I repeatedly whitnessed. There are just enough players PAYING for weapons to make most missions total blow-outs, absolutely unentertaining especially with the rediculously long respawn timer AND distance they put you away from the objectives. You spend more time waiting and traveling than playing the game. One hesitant thumb up, and one way down.  I've learned from APB and Dungeons and Dragons Online that I really do not enjoy the F2P model whatsoever. Either players are given rediculous advantages in gameplay (which breaks PvP games like this) or content restriction provides a lonely, frustrating game where the players are segergated by different levels of content access, as in the case of DDO.

318	0	a	This game is pay-to-win garbage. It doesn't even have a tutorial so you have to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around for an hour to find out what the hell is going on.
319	0	a	Well, overall recomendations are about right. I just installed this game and played it for a couple of hours. First thing i notice, there is no new player support. You have to guess how everything works.  When u find out how the game works, you can finally start to play.  with 'play' i mean get shot by high ranked ppl, get things whispered at you (not the nice things), stare at the screen while respawning and wondering what the *beep* u installed.  Game looks fun, could be fun if its not for the terrible matchmaking and pay to win what makes the newbie kind of useless.
320	0	a	A great potential â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up by its devs. What a waste of a good game...  EDIT: came back after 4 years to see what happened to this game.  Less players, more hackers, more pay2win G1 slaves, the same exploits and bugs from 2012, a few new guns and cars but not new gamemodes or important updates, ... My suggestion: Don't even try this game, it was a bit playable back in 2012 but now it's just impossible.
321	0	a	Worst game in existance. Freezes and Crashes constantly, Hackers everywhere, Laggy, Glitchy, and a complete Clone of GTA  EDIT: It's also pay to win, the devs are money vampires, they suck the money oudda ya' wallet!  I would give this a 3/10 at least the graphics are nice, but that doesn't matter because it won't even let me frickin (YOU FREAKING FRICKS WHEN WILL YOU LEARN) move and then freeze and crash..
322	0	a	Unbalanced peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that provides a poor tutorial that is really buggy to new players and pits NEW PLAYERS AGAINST PLAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE GAME SINCE IT CAE OUT! It also has weapons that are weak at the start, a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ interface, and you should just ignore this peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and play some tf2.
323	0	a	This game is a great concept that was executed by a horrible dev team.  First and foremost, this game is largely an FPS game; every mission boils down to a gunfight so you need guns to shoot where you're aiming, unfortunatly for APB the dev's decided to use random spread patterns for the guns. What does this mean? It means your gun will sometimes shoot straight, sometimes not, it's about 50/50. Even though the game does have a smidge of recoil, managing it does not increase accuracy or spread at all. On this fact alone you should not play this game, then throw in all the 'Pay2Win' weapons, horrendous server 'rubber-banding' (aka. lag spikes every 5 minutes), and this game becomes horribly broken and unbalanced.  As far as 'shooter' games go, stay far away from Gamers First, they are very incapable of utilizing common sense when create such genre of games.
324	0	a	Don't use any money on this game, EVER. GamersFirst will most likely take your account and ban it for some random reason they can come up with in 20 minutes, or you'll get yourself banned for receiving messages from someone on the other team screaming cuss words at you.  Gameplay is complete crap, and it's the most pay 2 win game I've ever seen. If you do not wish to spend countless hours every day grinding missions with absolutely useless weapons until you're almost max-ranked, so you can actually use some decent weapons with good modifications and a nice car, you'll have to pay insane amounts of money on weapons or cars. 
325	0	a	3 years ago probably one of the best games out there. NOW probably the worse one you can play if you play it for the shooting aspect. THE BAD #1 Get good with carbin or lose #2 Premium or die of old age #3 VERY toxic community (salty,tears,getgud,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥) typical vocabulary amongst #4 Porn #5 Animation canclation a thing #6 Seeing through certain walls (not fixed over years) #7 Unjust bans #8 cheat scripters not being banned? #9 very very lacking on updates #10 The more money you got (real cash) the more youl succeed -spent alot - notices difference   THE GOOD #1 Amazing customization #2 Good game to hang out with people #3 Car customization/Driving is awesome Thats it i give this game a big thumbs down - about 8K hours of game play over the past 5 6 years WORTH IT back then NOT WORTH it now .
326	0	a	Fun for a while... then it gets horrible. Go play GTA online, its much better.
327	0	a	I tried it - and i really wanted to love it. But it sucks - hard :I Also: russian cheaters - russian cheaters everywhere
328	0	a	Gotta love it when the game's first mission is to go up against people who have RPG's, sniper rifles, and LMGs.........just don't waste your time.
329	0	a	APB reloaded does not start the game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, DON'T get it
330	0	a	Honestly as long as I played this game on my record none of it was me having fun because there is no balancing system which means you`re either on the team with people who Pay2Win or you`re on the losing team against the people who poured money in to there is no middle.  4/10
331	0	a	this game is junk ..  peopele are hacking and skaming others .. you cant trade your weapons Or items you have to do it in the marked/AH  dont play it .. the owers of the game dont give a dunk abud the hackers or the peopele that skam others if you do send a email saying that this guy is hacking or you got skamed .. that dont care and will tell you that its a part of the game ..  you as a player can find other and better games out ther then this junk .. dont spend your time downloading it .. hallo kitty online is better then this :)  have a nice day
332	0	a	The game of great promises, greater disappointment and epic development fail. The game that's supposed to be every little boy's cops-n-robbers dream come true. However because of poor managment not only did it sink the company behind it, but even under the wings of a new owner people connected with the development process, being it developers or community managers, either got fired a few times or quit on their own.  The game is extremly newbie unfriendly, the weapon/shooting/engagement mechanics are so weird that the experience gained in other FPS/TPS games doesn't carry well into this one. There's a tutorial (finally, after being worked on for about 1,5 year or so), but it doesn't teach you anything that will help you to survive against hardened old timers of San Paro, because let's face it - the only people left still playing this game are the ever so bitter die-hards, that are so addicted, they won't let go. Be advised, you'll be facing them often, and when you do, they'll pull every dirty trick in the book, do anything and everything in their power to make your stay in San Paro as miserable and frustrating as they are.  So is this game this bad? That's a trick question. There's this really nice matchmaker feature that should match you up against people of simmilar skill level. It should, but currently the population pool is so low that the matchmaker has some real proplems finding the right people, so don't be surprised if a lot, if not most, of your missions are extremely one-sided. And most often you'll be on the wrong side.  APB is also the only game I ever played in which just driving around the map during the mission and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off your opponents can be way more fun than actually playing the game like it was meant.  It's also the only game that ups its hardware requirements bit by bit with each patch. I remember the times when I could record the game in 60FPS, 800x500, while running the game in 60FPS HD with highest detail settings and antialiasing. I don't know what went wrong, but the last time I ran it, I could barely get 45FPS on medium settings.  The greatest power of this game is that it's one of a kind, there's really no other like it. All the shooting and driving, and shooting while driving, car chases, skirmishes, sudden twists... all of this is great fun... until you get screwed either by being matched against a group of four teamspeaking clannies that will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you silly, or just the game itself, like: â€¢ being spawned 150m from the objective while the opposing team spawns right next to it, â€¢ being spawned in some sh!thole where the civilization suddenly died and noone owned a car, with the closest car spawner farther than the objective itself, â€¢ the objective spawning in a place thats nearly impossible to storm when properly defended, ofcourse with the enemy already guarding it â€¢ general respawn mechanics - missions get won or lost because of it. â€¢ weird camera workings, which results in your toon often obstructing whatever you're aiming at, â€¢ bugs that remain unfixed to this day, â€¢ so you just switched to your sniper rifle? Nice, but now the fight moved to a close quartes area, take your precious mission time and switch again; you did? Great, but we could use a sniper now... ... I could go on like this. There are just so many gameflow breaking faults of random annoyance that at some point you're so fed up with the game that you quit... only to go back two weeks later to have a lot of fun and then suddenly being reminded what â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you so much in this game, and you quit again... this love-hate relationship may go on for a while, but at some point you grow the maturity to finally quit, uninstall and never look back.  Currently the game dies little by little with the population systematically shrinking each month. There's a (supposedly) big update coming up (that's been delayed 2 years already) which will replace the dated, old, heavily customized Unread Engine with a 'factory issue' Unreal 3 engine (if I remember correctly). A lot of people bound great hopes with this event, however, as devs stated, the new engine will bring a bit better graphics and will allow to bring more content to the game a lot easier and faster. By more content I understand probably more guns, cars and clothing which will be sold thru ARMAS - the ingame cash shop. IMHO APB doesn't need more content, as it won't fix the game's fundamental issues, frustrating gameflow breakers and dangling pieces of gameplay mechanics that Real Time Worlds never managed to properly implement.  Update: G1 rolled an event that was actually worth playing so I decided to reinstall. After three hours I can clearly tell that the cheating is out of hand. Each mission in which I participated had at least one gold-threat low-rating player (which indicates a freshly created account) in both teams, running around in newbie clothes kicking everyone's â™¥â™¥â™¥ sky high. Go figure. Plus, old bugs, like the scoreboard bug (players from previous missions in current mission scoreboard, so you can't tell who're you up against) still not fixed. There's just absolutely no fun left in this game what so ever. No engine update is gonna save this burning trainwreck.
333	0	a	This game is broken... I downloaded the game off the official website and it would not let me launch it up. So i deleted the files and downloaded it off steam and yet again would not let me play. So i tryed to delete it again and it would not let me, even now as i write this review it says im playing APB, but i'm not. I dont know if this a common problem but personaly i am pretty disapointed.
334	0	a	Bad Community, Poor mechanics. COOL idea!  But I dont get it. The PEOPLE in the game are what are the worst. I'd rather deal with the crap from the DayZ player base....

CONS: - Bad graphic (Screenshots look better than actual in-game graphic, and YEAH, I mean even with everything set on ULTRA)  - â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ty optimization: Intel i7 + GTX780 Strix 6GB + 24 fu*kin gigs RAM (pc used mainly as a Graphic WORKSTATION just to be clear) and this is the ONLY game so far that still shows stuttering, drops frames for no reason, etc. We are talking about 90-70 fps driving around and suddendly 30-40 fps with a single explosion on screen!

344	0	a	Worst game ever! Do not play this S%#T.
345	0	a	I originally played this game over two years ago on the Gamerfirst game client. I have to say that the game is full of potential and could be way better. Especially if there was more lore on the characters. Besides just being there some of the NPCs that you get missions from seem like a shell with no personlity. Like Double B or Seung Bloodrose.  The customization is very amazing and thats one of the key features that sells the game and that got me too play. Though I did hear about the game on a sims forum  After a while the missions get too repetitive.   ____________  tl:dr, I don't recommend playing the game unless you play it with friends otherwise you'll be amazed by the customization and then be bored to death because of the repetiveness. :D

357	0	a	I'm not sure whether Steam has marked down the amount of time I've invested in this game, but I'd give it a rough estimate of about 300 hours, between 2012/13, and a quick reinstall in 2015 with a prompt uninstall afterwards.  First impression? MMO Grand Theft Auto with way more customization? Cool!  Or at least you think, until you actually start to do missions, or anything relevant to what your objectives are. Griefers are rampant, and Pay 2 Win mentality is ingrained in what could have been a great game from GamersFirst. You'll be killed by hackers, heckled in text chat for being new (or if you mess up at all over anything), have your eardrums blasted out by post-kill death sounds, and people who you cannot defeat simply because they've dumped (too much) real money into a garbage MMO.  Do yourself a favor, just buy Grand Theft Auto V and be dissatisfied with that. It won't be nearly as frustrating.
358	0	a	If you are not willing to spend $1500.00 on the game then dont get it. Its a P2P community where the kids cant earn anything so they steal their moms credit card and buy all the more powerful weapons.   While the players who want to play without putting any real money into the game have to use crappy guns with crappy accuracy, and the only way to get anything decent (Which you can only have for a short period of time) takes months of grinding. Ive played this game for 119.3 hrs and only gotten just over $17000.00 ingame cash. Which doesn't get you anything good if you were wondering.   This game is a waste of time and there are many other games out there that beat this one in overall performance and quality of the community, I give this game a -100 out of 10 due to its lack of free to play compatability ingame and its lack of a mature and friendly community, all I see in this game is a bunch of rich 10 year olds who get their parents to give them $500 allowance a week to spend on this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.  For your own sake and the sake of you're mental ability to play and have fun.   Dont download this game, play minecraft or something, which overall is a million times better than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ show.

362	0	a	Everyone uses grenades , it has unfair matchmaking and you know when it has a pack for $100 it's Pay 2 Win  Update : So it's been a year since my review so I thought I'd come back and try the game and it was awful , nothing has changed and the game feels even MORE broken than when I last played it , when I was trying to join a mission I was put against 3 players who were VERY experienced , I've only leveled up twice or something but I was going against guys that were in the Gold levels and had awesome gear while I was their with a crappy AK and 0 teammates , yes , the game wasn't giving me teammates. I just could not continue playing , it was so bad so after a year I can say this , it's worse than it was a year ago.

366	0	a	Best Idea: replace gamersfirst, call an actually good company like RockStar or Bioware. The game is truly amazing, 5 dollars in and It is so much fun. but gamersfirst has GOT to go, RockStar or Bioware would have the best time with this as it is a bootiful game but gamersfirst got high while driving it and crashed the train, leaving many people dead (banned), injured (dissapointed), and scarred emotionally (turned into the toxic community we all know and hate today).
367	0	a	I personally didn't like it. It was very confusing and I didn't know what was going on a lot of the time. I felt like I was forced into quests when I had no clue what to do. Not only that, but the lag was horrible. Everything mixed together and made a very bad experience for me and I was discouraged to play again and because of that I never played it again so I just uninstalled it. Thankfully it's a F2P, so if you want to give it a try, I won't stop you.

382	0	a	This game is horrible. Even for a free game. Do not install this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! First of all,the gameplay is awfull,the guns work like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and make no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sense,it's better to jump like a rabit around while shooting rather than taking a tactical position and controling u're recoill... The weapons don't make sense either,you start of with a g36,it's free.So that's supposed to be the worst weapon,so i purchased a AK-47 for a bunch of money,guess what...the ak sux for a lot of money --'' Secondly the hackers make me vomite. Then we have just the lame maps and ways to make money...It's all pretty boring i don't see any reason to play this game what so ever. Altough there is something well done in this game. The character creation is one of the best i've ever seen.Professional games these games even lack this,i wish skyrim had this kinda character creation. What they also did great is actually the music,it defently isn't bad at all. I don't recommend this at all,unless your a 7 year old that loves killing the time. Don't let the trailer control you,this game just sucks. 
383	0	a	you thought a crime vs cop game would be fun? TOO BAD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. yo will get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by everyone, breaking shops gives little to no reward, and you get a bounty usually higher than your gains... new car? spend some days in, you might get one lmao.  this game suffers from a pay to use customisation system, is heavily trying to make you pay for everything, and has a poor optimisation (level 9 players can hunt level 3's who broke shops) not to mention clans, who usually run on beginner tears to level up their members.  you start with crappy weapons which do less damage than a .22LR while looking full-size, you get your dime ten times for everything you try....and there is ninjas everywhere.
384	0	a	This is a classic FTP (free to play) P2W (pay to win) which is not fair for people like me who just don't have the money to throw at a video game just to have fun (now of course I don't mean paying the initial price for a game I am reffering to spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars just to get the upperhand on the rest of the community). Now on the contrary if you do have that kind of spare cash then this game won't be THAT bad for you, you will have access to all the customization and guns and whatnot. Overall I would give this game a 5/10 simply due to there not being GTA V for PC yet and this being the closest I know of to GTA V multiplayer.
385	0	a	When I've heard about All Points Bulletin for the first time... God, I was excited. It was a fresh formula combining typical 'GTA sandbox' with MMO elements. I followed every pre-release video, trailer and so on. When It finally came out on the market (Funny thing, APB was meant to be free-to-play from the beginning. As we can see now - the chance for everyone to play was only for fabricating the hype) It wasn't really THAT bad... I think that creators of the game condemned their game for failure just from the beginning. They didn't mentioned anything about the REAL formula of APB - 'cause APB isn't a GTA MMO - it's an online shooter with a really big arena and cars. Media and gamers called this game a 'GTA Online'. Back then, the developers didn't deny it.  APB had mostly technical issues, bugs and strange gameplay solutions. But it still offered much fun through customizing your car, your own character and shooting other people with this char. The game was fun to play, but had some unforgivable issues. Now, about so called 'Reloaded' version. ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE. After so many years the new developers didn't removed 4 YEARS OLD bugs and technical issues. Seriously. What's more - practically, they have created more. The game may not even work on some PC configurations. I managed to launch original 2010 APB on Intel Core 2 Duo + GeForce 8600GTX, but for some reason, after many hours of fixing up the problem, APB:Reloaded won't last played for 0,5h on Intel i5 + Radeon HD7870. Because f*ck the player.  The game is fun to play itself, but after slow progress it can get bored for a while. Especially when you fight those Premium players. The disbalance of Premium and non-Premium characters is very big - in cash, in weapons, in experience and so on. There is even a limit on a graphics that you can put on clothes or cars. Seriously. Because f*ck the player. Customization is still good, even after 4 years. What a shame, that it's so limited for a regular player. But you can still create something similar to your character of a dreams. You can slowly earn up for a car and car's modifications, but it is much longer process.  Driving a car is not very good because of server's delay. When you turn left, you send a signal to the servers of APB to make you drive left, and that causes some lags if you don't have a really good internet connection. This delay may be a bit similar to 'Hollywood car chase', but it's still a technical issue. Still not removed. Because f*ck the player. Shooting is k, most of the time, sometimes your character will not shoot to your crosshair location, because s*it happens. It still fun, and that's an advantage of APB:R's gameplay.  There is a good variety of missions, as well as arenas, so you won't get bored in ~15 hours, at least I was still interested to play even, when I get to know all the game's missions.  If you get APB:Reloaded to work properly - it may be a fun and interesting experience, depends on your liking of 'GTA like' games. Otherwise, you will get upset many times, for sure.  tl;dr Still fun to play, but with tons of technical issues and bugs, much disproportions between premium players and non premium players, try it out, 'cause it's free, darling, my final rating is 3-/6.
386	0	a	Everyone uses grenades , it has unfair matchmaking and you know when it has a pack for $100 it's Pay 2 Win  Update : So it's been a year since my review so I thought I'd come back and try the game and it was awful , nothing has changed and the game feels even MORE broken than when I last played it , when I was trying to join a mission I was put against 3 players who were VERY experienced , I've only leveled up twice or something but I was going against guys that were in the Gold levels and had awesome gear while I was their with a crappy AK and 0 teammates , yes , the game wasn't giving me teammates. I just could not continue playing , it was so bad so after a year I can say this , it's worse than it was a year ago.
387	0	a	the game fails to load at all no ater what i do and it goes he same with a mate of mine too
388	0	a	Awesome game for customization , you can design the craziest thing you ever imagined! But awful for pvp matchmaking in my opinion. Not to talk about the cheaters of course.
389	0	a	i give it a 4 out of 10 its not that bad its just repetitive otherwise it would be a great game
390	0	a	Game itself is pretty cool its like an open world online GTA but i have to warn you.. Don't even think about playing it untill another developer manages the game since the current one is f*cking greedy as f*ck while not caring about the game itself at all.
391	0	a	The balancing in this game is non-existent. If you buy an armas weapon (Armas martketplace is the microtransations thing from gamersfirst (Gamersfirst is completeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, more like moneysfirst)) then you will reak havoc. Whisper, joker cr5, and any other armas weapon against you will make you want to kill yourself. Good luck.
392	0	a	A failed uptopia, from its citizens to its infrastructure.  I love this game, and I may sometimes hop on, but I cannot in good conscience honestly recommend it.  +++PROS+++ The basic idea is wonderful. It's an open world city with customized characters pitting cops vs robbers for strategic operations and car chases.   This game is known for its vast customization. The Player Characters' bodies are customizable, tattoo-able, clothing customizable, cars customizable, theme songs, equipment, weapons.   The style of the non-player content is very attractive, a motion graphic setting a metropolis plagued by stylish punks; even the corporate executives are stylish.   If you're bored of killing, you can spend hours customizing or you can scrape some money up robbing places, catching robbers, stealing and returning cars. There are other things to do than missions.  It is not a pay to win game. Paying players will have some advantage, but it's really not a problem.  I'm going to go ahead and put the game's city in the Pros section. The cities do feel half alive. When I'm in the game, I feel like I'm in a city, not a backdrop of buildings, as I felt in Borderlands. There are plenty of stores, shops, apartments, places cities would need, and civilians walking around. The civilians are walking talking dolls that interact minimally, but it is just barely enough to make the city feel alive as I'm cruising in my car, looking at these 'civilians.' I do, however, wish the player contacts would interact with players more; they truly are cardboard cutouts, even with some of their dialogue.  ---CONS--- The game runs horribly. I'm no tech wizard, and I do have an old laptop, but for a game of this age with this level of texture and model quality, it's odd that I'm lucky if I can get any steady 10-15 frame rate at all.   This game is not especially well designed for the strategic action that was intended.  The levels are not perfectly balanced. There are only two city districts to play missions in, the main content of the game. The mission objectives are often in siege points of cqc mazes, surrounded by vast open areas; the enemy can see you coming from any direction, especially if they know the game's spawn points and routes well, and even if you manage to close the distance, they'll be waiting for you with cqc weapons ready. There aren't a lot of ways to flush enemies out of a siege position, other than being high leveled and affording grenade launchers.  The game's action is fast; characters are pretty zippy, compared to real life anyway. So, like Counter-Strike, this game gives strong favor to physical skills, reflexes and aim. Strategy and brainpower can help greatly, but a player can more easily brute force their way and kill enemies from disadvantaged terrain than they could in Ghost Recon Phantoms or even TF2.   Cover is used in this game minimally, you're obviously better off behind cover than in the open, the game does not really encourage strong use of cover. Cover is generally only provided in those cluttered maze like cqc areas. On the street, there is no cover except for exploding cars that do not protect your feet. In cqc areas, cover is less used because the fights are dances between two players with fully exposed hitboxes. There are short time limits on the missions, so players cannot wait around too long, especially if a fast moving enemy is patrolling the area. Once you get into cover to face an enemy at range, there's not a lot you can do to leave cover, as there is not a web of cover to leapfrog to and you don't have a lot of grenades and you don't have time for the coordination required for suppressive fire.  Teamwork is needed, but not really emphasized. Because of the low team sizes, teams are better off splitting up to attack from multiple angles. Being so far away from each other, players tend to act on their own; the only way to coordinate a team adequately is with a microphone; there is nothing to rally players together. Players do not need each other as all players have just about the same abilities; this is not TF2, where classes have strengths and weaknesses and are rallied by a medic.  The matchmaking is horrid. The game sets up some pretty unfair matches. Part of this is due to the low population, which is no doubt thanks to the game's problems and lack of aid to new players. And as you climb the ladder in skill, you will eventually find yourself constantly losing against the players at the top of the ladder, who never lose; they are lethal at all distances with an assault rifle and have the money to spam missiles and grenade launchers if they want to.   You win some you lose some, but all these things add up for too many moments where you'll have to learn the humility to surrender, knowing there was nothing you could do. Or if you do finally kill the guy who has been killing you over and over again, it was because of the luck of the aim rather than you being smarter. You just keep throwing yourself like water at a stone.   The community is horrid.   There are a lot of cheaters.  The game is an MMO. MMO's must constantly release new content until they eventually die out. This game is in its old age and it's handled by a small team that cannot release new content as often as needed. Even if they did, it wouldn't fix the base problems of the game.
393	0	a	The gameplay isn't bad... if it wasn't for the fact that this is a micotransaction filled game. All the guns have that 'buy it and own it for 9 days' kind of thing, which is annoying as hell.   I also can never seem to find other players to actually play matches with. Are people just not playing this or is the system just broken?   Has potential but just kinda sucks.
394	0	a	I thought this game was very bad as the setup was very slow and i had isues installing it due to it containing a virus and hacking my firewall.
395	0	a	i cant play it i just seem to see it stop when i press start \
396	0	a	APB has got to be the worst free to play game out there! it doesn't use any antihacking programs and most of it's players have a bad attitude! It's a pay to win game, wich means they ripoff their players because they don't stop the hackers, wich means people who pay for ingame guns to be better really arent because there are hackers everywhere! When you join a mission you will either get kicked from it by the leader coz of your low rank or your team mates will kill you to annoy you, then when you get enemies they will kick you. it's a horrible game to play, it only causes stress! 0/10 from me, i uninstalled it because i hate the attitude of its players. (Games are suposed do be fun and enjoyable).
397	0	a	APB Reloaded has the worst community I have ever seen in a game. The game must have an assclown magnet coded in to it. Decent game, ****ty people, not worth the hassle.
398	0	a	A W F U L
399	0	a	I don't know how to put it other than that it sucks.
400	0	a	This game is very fun and very addictive, but it is just full of hackers and everything you work for just gets taken away or 'expired'. For a free game, it has potential to be one of my favorite MMO's. But I kept finding myself very aggrivated and upset that the guns or cars I worked to buy just 'expire'.  In my opinion, if you want to buy things for the game with real life money, then you will like this game. If you are looking for a good free MMO. Then I would not recomment this game.
401	0	a	Pros: -Imagine the dream of the original GTA creator. Think about how revolutionary this game could have been. -Customizable vehicles, clothes and character (to an extent due to microtransactions business model).  Cons: -Play with the unfinished product of the original GTA creator, which really is the messy afterbirth resulting from the mismanagement of over $100 million dollars by the original game developers. Now deal with the Gamersfirst company that bought APB after the game's first official launch and subsequent bankruptcy of the original developer Realtime Worlds. -'Pay 2 Win.' Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Gamersfirst is milking the game before it dies. -The game is dead. Only a few hundred people playing it compared to the thousands before. -'Progression 2 Win.' Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Requires lots of character level grinding. -Poorly optimized. Requires a high performance computer to run subpar graphics. -Boring and poorly designed missions. Perform boring and menial tasks that are not attached to any real storyline. Experienced players (with or without Pay 2 Win items) will exploit the poorly designed missions and maps to win. -Ugly and lifeless city. NPCs don't do anything except walk around and yell during gunfire. They will occassionally glitch or disappear. The maps do not have enough detail and it feels like you're wandering through a ghost town. For a game about 'cops and robbers,' it makes you question the storyline and motivations of each side when the city and NPCs are lifeless like this. -rampant hacking issues since beta release 4-5 years ago.  Overall: 3/10 -Terrible. APB is still a broken game after 4-5 years after the first release. It was better during the Realtime World's beta, but somehow Gamersfirst made it worse. You may be curious and excited about the features shown in the trailers during the first hour of play, but APB Reloaded and Gamersfirst will suck your soul. IT WILL SUCK YOUR SOUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLL...  
402	0	a	Do i recommend this game to other players? no. why?  1.Match Making system is bad (Example: a player played the game for 50 hours can matched with a player who played 800 hours.  Another example if this game is like League of Legends, they are making bornze fight platinum or gold fights diamond)  2.hackers (Some top rank players can be hacker)  *3.They want money ( what i mean is that fix the game is not their primary, they made more things to buy and try to attract more players)  4.Bad performance(Server like waterfount is not stable, ping jumps from 50 to 500)  But if you want to know the good side of this game, here is what i found.  1.customize ( custom your clothes , your car , your music , or the troll music that the player gonna hear it after you kill them.)  2.you are playing with 100 people ( The idea of have a free world and your battles can be any where in the map is great and the missions can get effect by other players that have nothing to do with you is interesting, it makes you feel you are playing a lots of people not just a server with 10 people in it)  3.Freedom( There is more other then just doing missions,  you can play fight club if you don't feel like to finish a whole match, that you can quit any time you want and you will still get rewarded.  Or you just don't feel like you want to fight, you can just drive in the free world or you can go to social district talk to other people, looks at other people custom maybe get some new idea and use on your own, trade, make your self look more badass or cute, make some music etc)  4.Is a mixed game , it can cover a lot( Is a shooter game but is also a driving game, it can even be strategy game or a rpg, it have skills on character , guns , and cars . It have a lot to explore)  And that is the good side and the bad side of this the game. I would say if you do not have the patience then this game is not for you, the good stuff doesn't come if you can't pass it's dark side first . However if you have patience and are interest what it have to offer to you, you can try but no guaranteed you will get what you want.

408	0	a	There was once a time when this game was full of potential with lots of promises made to the playerbase. Now that potential is wasted and lots of promises forgotten.  Its all pay to win with endless grinding for those not willing to invest hundreds of euros in to this dying game.  Really awesome customization though. Gotta pay for that premium first though.  And then some.  But after all that said. I've had much love for this game since the real time worlds first launch. Even though it is repetive to the max there was something that kept you going to the next mission and try again.
409	0	a	Only pro is the unparalleled customization that so far no MMO has beaten.  Cons include hackers, pay2win extremity, hackusations, trash community, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor optimization, bad matchmaking, repetitive missions, utter grindfest.

411	0	a	What used to be an amazing game with great fun and laughter for friends and clan members has now become 'Hackers Paradise'. Gone are the days when G1 cared primarily for the customer, and now only care about the greed and how much they can make. GamerFirst, commonly now called HackersFirst and MoneyFirst are nothing more than Greed Monkeys who, if you pay lots of money to through ingame items, will allow you to freely hack on their servers until they do a massive cleanup and ban you. But alas, I recently was informed and shown an email from a clan members friend who was banned where G1 had banned him, during the cleanup, and offered to release his account if he paid a penalty and agreed not to hack again. According to the clan member, he paid the fee, updated his hacks and then carried on hacking.  The owners and operators of this game do not care about you reporting players, nor do they care about players who spend little on the game. Those who spend the most rule the game and ruin it for others. Do not play this game and do NOT spend money on it at all.

416	0	a	Even if I would recomend the game to anyone, I still think you shouldn't play it because of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ company behind it.  I played APB since the realtime worlds time. I love it and played it like crazy. I bought several ingame purcases and spent several hundreds of dollars. And then, boom. I got banned. For no reason at all.  They say I have ben using third party tools. I say I havn't. I mean, I speak in skype with my friends when I play, but that's the only program I can think of.  I tried to tell them that I hadn't cheated, they kept telling me that I had. It didn't matter that I had played hundreds of hours and spent hundreds of dollars. In their eyes I was just a lousy cheater that didn't even deserve a second chance. Even though I had done nothing wrong.  That was about a year ago. I still havn't gotten my account back. I have spoken with both gamersfirst and evenbalance (punkbuster) but I keep getting the same response.  Play if you want, but don't buy anything. Because if do get banned, even if you havn't done anything wrong, you will never ever get your account or the money and time spent on it back.
417	0	a	If cancer was a video game it would be this one. No hit reg, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ machanics, dumb pay to win guns, terribly optimized, cheater rampant, you wont be competitive enough with the losers who try their asses off abusing broke game features until you have put at least 500 hours into the game and gotten what should have been starter guns. Many of the 'best players' have been aim hacking for months if not years, and use the game as a platform to boost their ego. The developers have run this game into the ground and are milking what little money they can from it until even the nolifes with 10,000 hours realize this game isnt worth playing anymore.
418	0	a	I'll save you a lot of download time and stress. This game sucks from tutorial on forward.   First, the graphics for such a huge game are not impressive. It's basic at best, and the latency is horrible. How can you play a FPS with everyone on server having +600 ms ping? You can't. Uninstall reason #1.   The tutorial is horrible. There is a list of things to do, but nowhere does it explain what to do or how. You constantly have to press the 'help' key to review quests. Even then, it is confusing and boring.   So you finally complete some tutorial quests and see people driving all over, smashing, talking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, being trolls. Now you have to observe a crime? I observed many, nothing is a 'crime' according to this game.   Sum up this game real fast.   A bunch of cash shopping trolls using the sand box as a chat room and abusing the imbalanced missions with friends. Why are 99% of the cash shoppers females? I'm guessing it's Napoleon complex inferior kids and ladyboy caitlyn jenner wannabes in a dead sandbox of very limited repetitive boring missions with garbage combat gameplay.   I was hoping for something more like Tom Clancy Ghost Recon with some GTA. Instead I got a old UT2000 generic gaming engine with runescape questing and combat.   8/10 waste of hard drive space 7/10 waste of download time 9/10 for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game of transgender trolls 11/10 would tell off the global chat before uninstalling again
419	0	a	Being that this is a shooter, I would kind of appreciate more button mapping options for controllers. The defaults are akward and clunky. And the tutorial is difficult to manuver when you are trying to learn the new buttons. So this one didn't last very long with me, even though I am aware that my opinion won't be popular amongst the MMO community.
420	0	a	i try using the client it keeps crashing errorYou were kicked by PunkBuster for the following reason:  'PunkBuster kicked player 'PlayerName' (for 0 minutes) ... RESTRICTION: service communication failure: PnkBstrBprogram driver failure (PnkBstrK.sys) ffab'  i have tried the PunkBuster random kick fix where i need to download the PBsetup and then install that to the APB Reloaded folder, And then run it and install PunkBuster again, Then add APB Reloaded to the game list and check for updates. I've done all this about 5 times i have also download the PBsvc to try and fix any errors within PunkBuster but have not found a solution that has done anything to help, So now i am on here begging for a solution to this pointless annoying problem, in the hope that someone smarter than me might no what i may have missed out on.  i am having the same problem but i deleted it and download it again shut down my laptop and it worked a little bit like a few minutes but then it crashed and said the same thing again and was unable to log into it at all.  i like this game its a really good game i played a little bit the shooting was good but in the video grenade should of killed people throwing grenade should of killed people if they had no body armour .  not being able to host your own game or host room is really bad and not being able to solo with out using matchmaking really sucks since if there no one online i have no idea but if you can't play with out matchmaking or players that is honestly stupid since this game looked amazing and creating your person very good programming and car programming and the aiming and the blood shoot dripping is perfect.  this game looks really good so far i played it a little bit but it needs a lot of love and lot of work it could be the best gta for steam.

422	0	a	The only redeeming quality of this game is its customization.  Everything else is rubbish.  2 / 10000 aim-botting, wall-hacking, wallet-warriors
423	0	a	If I was stuck in a room with only a computer,a copy of APB, and a fully loaded revolver--I'd shoot myself 6 times before I play this steaming â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
424	0	a	The only good thing about this game was the character customization. Everything else is absolute shÎ¯t. Also, the developers are a bunch of greedy asshÎ¿les.
425	0	a	current state of this game ? -waste of time. not even worth a long review
426	0	a	This game use to be awesome during the open beta. Now its full of cheaters and Pay to Win items that makes Free Players almost impossible to win. I feel sorry for anyone that continues playing this game since your wasting time and possibly money. Yeah the game has its moments like the customization of cars, clothing and players. The engine is Unreal 3 and it runs O.K. but it still lags and freezes with the occasional FPS drops that come out of no where. I'm just dissappointed in a very shady business model of a game that resembles GTA.
427	0	a	Im sick of these games, i aint gonna act like the rest of these reviewers acting like they are actually critics. What im gonna do is tell the truth. APB Reloaded is awful, the only reason its actually fun is to either troll or screw up the terrible physics engine, you go around in a dump truck and crush a player's cars and killing them, which is very fun, this aint no GTA rip off, it dosent even deserve that title, its a pay to win cash fest, buy a gun= real money, buy a car= real money, hell there is even gambling with real money! You go to a contract and then they give you a mission, its always the same, either bomb a car, steal a car or kill the enemy or graffiti some walls for some reason! Some missions no enforcers actually attack you, in some missions they do. And this is where the fun begins *sarcasm* the balance system sucks so much it could swallow a blue whale, it literally pairs you up with morons who just started the game, and the enemy are silver players with the best guns in the game, basically the game was pretty fun, untill it became pay 2 win, first started the OP guns, HEY PLAYERS PAY Â£40 FOR A GUN THAT KILLS IN 2 HITS! The game can sometimes be fun, but after a couple of hours it becomes incredibally boring and you wonder what would happen if this game wasent free? Maybe more gamemodes, maybe more stuff, maybe some actual fun. Oh yeah, this game isent cops and robbers, the enforcers get the same guns as the criminals, they have different names but they do the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you go around in free roam and you cant start a police chase, the only time a cop can attack you is if they see you pick up a item that dosent belong to you (ram raid) and then it makes you go into this minigame where you have to put the evidence in a place and so does the cops, also the bag of evidence makes a sports car turn into a segway so good luck with that. The game would be alot more fun if the cops could actually do cop stuff, like arresting you, they should be able to spot you then have to arrest you for extra money and you go into this L.A Noire interrogation minigame, NOW THAT WOULD BE FUN, but nope the only way they can arrest you is if they stun you and arrest you then you disapear and respawn lol. 35/100 (btw if you want some real money, wait at a contract place for a ram raider to arrive to sell his stuff then steal his van full of items :D)
428	0	a	The game can be quite fun and more or less fair (even without paying any money), but I ran into the following problem:  After installing and starting it up I suddenly got a Punkbuster permanent ban after about 15 minutes of playing. I didn't cheat, I don't even have cheat related software on my computer (I know, you don't believe me and that's okay, but I'm speaking the truth here). The support won't do a thing about it (just sending pregenerated messages) and Punkbuster only tells you that someone else may have hacked my account and cheated.. which I don't believe.  I then made another account on my Laptop and have played for hours there without getting a ban. Now I'm afraid to spend any kind of money on this game if I'll just get banned again without even getting a proper reason.  So watch out if you do intend to spend time and money in this game, I still don't know why Punkbuster issued a ban on me. It could either have been Nvidia Shadowplay (with the FPS overlay) or Borderless Gaming (which I didn't use for this game) or AutoHotKey (Which I use for my keyboard layout and have never had a problem in any other game yet). I heard there are ways to cheat with AutoHotKey, but I never touched any of those scripts.  So believe me or not, but I was a legitimate player and received a permanent ban after 15 minutes of playing. Support won't help a bit and Punkbuster won't tell me why they banned me, so I'll probably never find out what happened.
429	0	a	I would not recommend this game if you don't want cancer. I have 1500 + hours in this **** had to create new accounts to play, becaue after their launcher got destroyed, only steam was aviable, and you couldn't log into your account that was from the launcher. DON'T PLAY THIS PAY2WIN GAME. Pros : It was good in 2010-2012 no cheaters nothing, wasn't pay2win Cons: It began to be bad with lots of cheaters, micro transactions, bad engine, laggy servers, no updates just weapon and premium car skin ugrades, etc,,
430	0	a	I really want to like this game. Really, I do. But I can't help but feel that it doesn't want me to.  There is so much right with this game; customization, free-roam game play, thirperson shooter, all of which I like, but at the same time, so much wrong. Little has been added to the game in way of permenant additions, since the game has been acquired from realtime worlds. There have been seasonal events, sure, but other than that, not much else. 4 end game contacts a very long time ago, aside from that, the only regular updates are patches, to attempt to fix balance issues and performance issues and the whole lot, and to the infamous armas store (which is the game's premium shop where you can buy many things for real life monies.) I don't really agree with the way the game's premium shop works, and that's another major flaw to this game, for me. The community is just horrible. There is a clear lack of moderation in the chats and it is apparent as people often hold obscene coversations, or just spurt out vulgar comments to other players for no good reason. I'm not sure weather it's that the game attarcts the worst kind of people or rather it just brings out the worst in people, but there is just so much wrong here. Gameplay wise, the game is somewhat hit or miss. There are times where you can sit down and play and have a great time. Other times, not so much. There are alot of unbalanced aspects to gameplay that people will abuse just to gain a win. Weapons aren't at all balanced, there are clear 'good' and 'bad' weapons, which only further drags the game down.  I can go on and on with all the reasons I feel that this game is not worth playing, but in a way, I somewhat do reccomend the game to people. If you have a group of friends, this game may be for you, but to just anyone looking to play by themselves, I would recommend to stay away. I feel that I have fully experienced all this game has to offer me, and no, I do not recommend this game.
431	0	a	it's cool
432	0	a	Too many hackers/modders.
433	0	a	Wont start on windows 10 :'(
434	0	a	Doesnt load crap, freezes up lots, slow loading screen
435	0	a	Played this game a lot, spent a lot of money on it, got banned for no reason and support wont help you get your account back if you do get banned for any reason. So if you are gonna play this game dont be good or youll get accused of hacks and get banned. Do not Recommend this game unless you wanna take the risk of getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed over for no reason.
436	0	a	I just want to say this game is perfect example have Pay To Win in Free to Play can make game worst..... Game is soooo good for about 10hrs but after that you can see and get in lobby guys what have a lot of payed stuff and that is really bad becouse it gives them a lot of boost and advantage.. You can see how game is set around Pay To Win becouse every time you start game it shows you shop with stuff for reall money... Its really good game but only if you buy in game items for reall money.... Gamersfirst Fix this ....
437	0	a	I'm so glad to see people agree with me. Let me just give you guys my opinion on this sad little potential wasted game. On the outside, this game looks pretty good. It's true, you get to customize your character, do some fun things around the city and play games in teams with different objectives. Sounds good right? Nope. This game will constantly pester you to become a 'premium member', and if you do that, you get more money in game, and even get things like more tattoos. Premium members can have up to 50 tattoos. Guess how many normal players get? 3. THREE. And even if you do pay for premium, there are still other things you have to pay real money for if you want to enjoy the game, for instance, guns. The most important thing in this game. You'll find the guns you are given to start off are awful, but fair enough. You can buy guns with ingame money and 'joker tickets', which are a pain to get hold of, and the gun expires in 7 days after you've bought it, so you'll have to collect the funds to buy it again! You could buy guns with real life money of course, which are overpowered and very expensive. I thought this game is decent enough to maybe pay a little more, so I decided to check out the store. I found this gun I liked for Â£5. I thought, maybe as a one off. Then I looked and it said I'd only have it for 30 days. There IS an option to keep the gun forever, but guess how much that would be? Â£25! You could buy a whole new, better game out of that! And this is just for 1 gun, out of the wide variety of guns you can get. And the thing is, this game is not 'OUTSTANDING'. It seems like it could be a decent game, fairly fun (if you weren't getting constantly killed by those who do buy over powered gun), and worth playing, and maybe paying a little for. But it's just ridiculous how much you'd have to pay if you wanted to have a good time with this disappointment. Thank god GTA 5 and GTA Online is coming to PC.
438	0	a	Worst game ever. If u want to do anything that is not dying, pay $100 or ull have weapons that kills after 2 magazines oh shooted bullets. But if ull pay about $200 you can even try to kill somebody with ur 2 shoot kill machine gun. ULTRA PAY 2 WIN GAME .
439	0	a	I cannot remember EVER hating a game as much as this game. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had playing a video game. After reading the other bad reviews of the this worthless game, I don't feel it neccessary to go into details of why it's so bad, because the others did a good job of it. I just want to make sure that the idiots who made this game get another negative review. I only spent 5 dollars on this game and I have never wanted a refund for something this bad in my life. SKIP THIS GAME.
440	0	a	I really can't say I would recommend this game. The biggest issue I take with the game is the fact that the majority of the equipment you can purchase in the game (guns, cars, etc.) are time-based/temporary if you purchase with in-game currency. If you want to keep the weapon for good, you have to purchase it with real money (which defeats the purpose of this game being  F2P ).  To make matters worse, I would run into griefers/hackers every day &amp; decided the game just wasn't worth it after a short amount of time playing it. I came back to it a few times trying to look past the obviously flaws, but just didn't keep my interest &amp; I decided I was done with it.  If you don't mind micro-transactions, griefers &amp; hackers, then this game may be acceptable to you, but I for one don't have a place for it in my gaming library anymore...
441	0	a	You will play the game.. You will encounter many Hackers... You will rage your little heart out.. But in the end... You will always have a craving to play the damn game..  EDIT: Just kidding.. You will hate everyone.
442	0	a	this game wont even work for me ive tried everything if someone knows how then please tell me 
443	0	a	Doesnt load crap, freezes up lots, slow loading screen
444	0	a	Slightly enjoyable when playing with a group of friends... not a stellar recommendation but it is words put together to form a quasi-sentence.
445	0	a	Extremely laggy, and is not recommended for weak computers.
446	0	a	this game is pay to win system and they can ban you for nothing becouse the banning system is really bad even if u have no cheats or hacks or something else it can ban even if u got another client of this game like i had the russian one where was the russian searvers and ukraine servers too in that time i lounched them both becoues i forgot to turn of the russian client and punkbuster thought that it was some kind of cheat and banned me forever i tryed to ask the support of the gamersfirst but they said no we cant do that so i am saying it is just my opinion that apb is the worst game ever
447	0	a	Have you ever had a moment in your life where you're excited and ready to go? Starting APB was like that for me. I made my character, grabbed a gun, and went out into the world of gang violence.  Much like real gang violence, I was repeatedly brought low by people who bought better weapons than I could, could use the same weapons I had to better effect, and was matched up in a 'fair' fight against people who were like gods to me as an ant. even my car could best be described as a thin plastic shell around a chunk of explosive that functioned as an engine. Within 16 hours of gameplay, I had made every possible worst decision, from choosing a shotgun with the spread the size of a small house, to attempting any sort of PvP at all when close-quarters fighting meant gangbangers instantly ending my life repeatedly with SMGs and sniper rifles, while assault rifles were used to pick opponents off from 100 meters away. Any attempt at buying improved weaponry to escape the hellish catch-22 of ranking up to get new weapons was met with a paywall, and those who bought these rank-exempt weapons were unto demigods in their own right, as these 'same but different' weapons had the characteristics of their real life counterparts. Which, of course, meant they could actually kill you, unlike the peashooters and feather guns regular players are given. All in all, it's the standard Korean MMO pay-to-win format, but with guns and cars. Good if you need to be humbled or have the reflexes of a supercomputer.
448	0	a	Okay. This is pretty hard for me. I've been playing All Points Bulletin ALOT. I played it back when Realtime Worlds released it. I played it the time where you could leave your character in the 'Car Creator' over night and gain multiple thousand of dollars for doing nothing. Good times!  Back then, it was a fun new idea. Massive Multiplayer Third Person Shooter! It was GTA, but online with friends! Shoot with or against your friends through various locations, get new cars and edit your own music. The character creation and customization is beyond great! Very deep and there are so many different clothing options that all are design-able. Back then the game cost about 50 dollars, and you paid for the time you played. And when you had bought your X number of hours, it only counted the minutes you were in the game. There were plenty of ways to get even more hours, just by playing the game! And you wanted to. Damn, I played the sh*it out of it.  But alas, Realtime Worlds went down in 2010. Along with the game itself. Plenty of gamers from all countries were upset about this. I even logged in on the last day it was online, playing with the admins. Teleporting around and up on tall buildings. It was upsetting, really.  But then in the first half of 2011 All Points Bulletin: Reloaded was launched. And now it was Free-to-Play. It was great! Back was the customization, back was the open city and the cars. And for a time everything was great.  But sooner than later you started feeling the 'Free-to-Play' restrictions. And it pains me, because I enjoyed the game very much in its young years. Now you have to pay to be a 'premium' member. Which basically is what the game was for everyone back in the day. Your design slots are restricted unless you pay, which was on of the big reasons this game was so great. The game is infected with hackers and Pay-to-Win people who empty their credit cards on Armas Marketplace (Which basically is a 'Pay five dollars for the greatest weapon in the game' kind of shop) just to dominate every game. The ranking system, which was created to separate the newbies from the hardcore, is broken and unbalanced. If you go from Bronze to Gold in the same map, you will not be removed until you leave yourself. Most experienced players will just lose on purpose and kill themselves until they rank down to bronze, so they can join the newbies and kick their asses.  And the worst part? I can understand that. Because the Gold ranked servers are so infected with Hackers and 'Pay-to-Winners' that, unless you're willing to use hundreds of dollars, you wont stand a chance against.  Back then, when Realtime ran the show, I would probably have given the game an 8/10. I enjoyed it so much, and it was so different from everything else on the PC at the time.  But now? As I said earlier, the game was GTA with friends. Now we have GTA 5 Online (On PS3/4 and Xbox 360/One. Pc from mid-April), which does everything APB did, but better. I can't look away from the game's HUGE problems. The hackers got to go, and the Armas Marketplace has to be balanced with the weapons you can buy from vendors in-game. How the f*ck are anyone else going to stand a chance? And in general the free-to-play rules don't fit the All Points Bulletin I knew. Though I understand the practice, seen from a company's eyes. ($$$)  If I were to recommend this to anyone, it should be to play around with the games amazing in-depth editor. It's on cars, characters, clothes, tattoos and more. But not much else. Today, it earns a 4/10 from me. Don't play it, unless it is to fool around for a bit.  I play it primarily for nostalgia. Nothing else.
449	0	a	This game is one huge piece of greedy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. All it does is steal money from you to give to some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s working from their mom's basements making fun at everyone.  Don't in a gazillion years buy this game or anything made from these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.
450	0	a	i played this game for well over 300 hours, it full of hackers, unless you wanna spend real money on this game. i would say dont brother, this game is truly cancer
451	0	a	just got it finished downloading then needed to update and takes forever and it stops and dosent save my download%. 
452	0	a	After 3 years of playing it,I can make a review: First of all,this game is in the category 'pay2win',for example a DLC with a few costumes,vehicles and some weapons that are NOT permanent costs 93â‚¬.Not to mention that you can really enjoy this game after you pay at least 100$.. These are the pros: -Great character and vehicle customization,it even include a symbol designer,which you can use for creating your own symbol -Each mission has his own story,like delevering a briefcase or killing the opposite team Cons: -You have to pay at least 100$ to enjoy -Laggy -Still full of bugs -Hackers -The gold ranked players invading silver ranked servers -It gets boring,it has only 2 mission districs,1 social(in which you can customize your character,vehicle and socialize),and 2 other districts in which is only team deathmatch;excluding events -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t community,if you haven't spent 50$ or more you are considered a 'noob' -If you are new or think of start playing this game,you stand no chance agains the player with OP weapons that cost over 500$. Back in 2011/2012 it was better,even thought were still some problems My rating for this 'game' is 5/10
453	0	a	First of all imma just let people know if you love customizing and making cool stuff in a video game then this may be the right game for you. If your competitive play then this game is not for you. APB has to be the most fustrating online third person shooter i have ever encountered. I literally sit here and rage day and night. The game comes with horrible lag right now hackers and any other and most of these hackers return for round 9 yep round 9 they are that determined.   APB's gun play is the most horrible i can say comparing it to csgo, csgo has to be the bomb atleast their gun play makes sense and there is some pattern and strategy to be used but for apb i would just say majority of the guns act very unrealistic and are very difficult to master and for some of them even though you master them they still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you up in alotta ways.  The armas maket place is where you spend real money for guns,cars,clothes,etc. As many have said gamers first should just call themselves money first and even i agree that the cash shop prices are super unreasonable making this game look like its for the rich and famous.   The community is extremely toxic thanks to hackers who aimbot silently and you average 4 year jerk off who will just make you feel like crap cause your not at their level. Their are alotta cheap ways players can win a game in apb for instance you will find urself getting to a final mission where you have to capture an item and the opposing team or your team will take the item and run away with it and you now have to chase them and depending on the type of vehicle/ mods/ level of the play you wont even stand a nose hair of a chance at reclaiming the item making this game obiously onesided, trust me you can litterally see when you should just stop trying sometimes.  This game is still gun but like i said its fustrating. I can see myself leaving this game pretty soon.
454	0	a	Too Damn Laggy  Graphics must be fixed !

456	0	a	All the gameplay is just you being killed by people who have been playing longer
457	0	a	want to enjoy the game? buy the swagglicious overpriced cash item first.
458	0	a	Its a decent game, with great content. but all of the weapons and vehicles are purchased for 1 day, 7 days, month, or permanent. Permanent costs real money or so much money it would take you weeks to months to afford a car. Game is a basic pay to win game, with content that requires ingame money that you can take FOREVER, or you can use real money to get what you want. If you have multiple friends that play this game, then investing is not a bad idea. GTA 5 is a newer version of a freeroam MMO, but lacks the content as APB/ customization.
459	0	a	This game is piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥   1.Hackers 2.Bad grafic 3.after 11 Hours it`S boring 4.to expensiveweapons (i payed for ATAC 34,00â‚¬ = 45 USD) 5.Banned without reson (179r ,Gold rank, a lot of money, weapon for 34â‚¬, 170Hours) . 6.Ban is able at any program the Gamersfirst doesn`t know.  Don`t play this Game you just frustrated because the pro`S(Hackers) the never get ban. when you play it a long time u are a kind forced to buy for money (cars,weapons,kits and much more).

464	0	a	What a horrible game, after installing the game, I waited close to five minutes for it to finally load. Then, with the limited choices available for character creation, alot in list, but not all available; then finally, when ready to start the game, it FREEZES, to the point that it wouldn't even let me shut it down with task manager, wouldn't even let task manager window come up. I actually had to log out of my computer account for the stupid game to let me OUT.
465	0	a	If you play this game without pay RIP or rather Rest In Grinding. Unless you pay for this game, you will find yourself grinding hour after hour. The customization is horrible if you are not a premium player. You should probably not play this game if your going to not play as a premium player. It was fun while it lasted. RIP APB and RIG all non prem players.

468	0	a	This game has a fantastic concept. Free, open-world, full customization of your character, go on missions with new people; all this stuff makes for a pretty fun game...but the game is extremely unbalanced. Because of this inbalance, it has caused more rage than it has fun. When you are matched against players that are on your level, it is very very fun. But the chances of this happening are extremely slim. Chances are, when you are starting out, you'll be against so players with better skill, better weapons, and better experience. If you don't pay for the bonus weapons, you're going to fall behind and it'll take quite a while for you to catch up to the players that you get matched with. Often times when I play this, I think about how much more fun I could have playing something else where the matchmaking isn't so imbalanced.

484	0	a	This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.

502	0	a	APB Reloaded is terrible, everything is either incomplete or broken. Just like the movie After Earth the amount of advertising made the hype too large for them to handle, they managed to get Tobuscus and Seananners to be in their Live Action trailer, but unlike After Earth, you canâ€™t watch it as a comedy, because even though M. Night. Shamadingdong movies are a joke within themselves, games have to be experienced, people have to do things to experience and in a movie you just watch it, in games you have to experience it for yourself.   Letâ€™s start with the glaring issue. Either my crappy computer wonâ€™t run APB while recording to do a video review or that this game refuses to let me record on it, bear in mind I play games like Banished and DC Universe Online while recording on this computer so I dunno, but Iâ€™m leaning to APB. Also it has this fun habit of pulling my computer to a screeching halt to only throw me back into the action 5 seconds later 100 game metres ahead of my last non-lag location. Again this is not my computer, DC Universe functions just fine on this laptop, a game bigger and better than this game, so why does this game make me believe every time I try to drive a car, my computer is going to spontaneously combust?   Letâ€™s talk about the driving, now this game is interesting. Most games run the driving controls through the same server, registering at the same time as you would be running right? NOPE! In fact the Driving mechanic is simulated on the servers, and the server controls where your vehicle is located, so when you try to turn the server has to calculate where you will be when you turn, and then it sends back the coordinates and the direction you will be facing. There's normally about a half second of delay but the instant response you get in EVERY OTHER GAME WITH CARS IN THEM EVER, Is really off putting, Youâ€™re not holding the key down to turn because who knows how long the turn will last, you end up tapping it really fast to be more accurate, that is not a good thing, because you have to calculate the speed youâ€™re travelling the catch the turn or youâ€™ll hit the wall.  The game back bone is lacking, the cars are broken beyond belief, what about the guns and the character customization. The APB Reloaded character creation screen is the best thing this game has to offer, itâ€™s in depth and you can really show your individuality. This is implemented well, with your Personal Vehicles and Clothing, however you have to go to another server to do all these customization, in hindsight that was a wise thing to do, didnâ€™t want players to be constantly spawn killing you while youâ€™re customizing a symbol you put on your shirt or car. Itâ€™s smart but still frustrating when the loading screens are horrific. It only loads to a map where you choose to spawn which then takes you into another shorter loading screen. If you just look at the gameplay trailer announcing APB is going free to play, the graphic have drasicly changed from the video to the game.   This isnâ€™t a new thing, for example Dark Souls 2 and Watch_Dogs but this isnâ€™t the same game, worse graphics by only a bit, there is a massive UI overhaul, it was like someone downloaded a mod to the game server and decided to mess the UI up as if it was a rage quitter at a board game and smash the crap out of it, itâ€™s a mess. Itâ€™s not user friendly at all. Now when I was younger and stupider, I posted videos on YouTube of me playing this game, and I will admit it has changed, they have added two more areas, basically the same two areas, Financial and Waterfront, but its PVP, so hopefully, more of these battles can happen, but I somehow doubt it.  APB Reloaded is a game, which is torture to play, for some reason people love it, they are all really high level players, they say the game is different when you get past this level, well they said the same about destiny, Iâ€™ll never find out if either are true, because of the same reason, while youâ€™re in the small levels, youâ€™re constantly screaming at your screen as all the people which are good at the game kill you in one hit. Itâ€™s a vicious cycle I donâ€™t enjoy, thatâ€™s why I giving the symbolic rating of Grand Saintâ€™s Crackdown type of game and numerical rating of 3/10. Also ever since I played this game my computer runs slower, I think this game is virus, I would be surprised from the legend known as EA, â€˜itâ€™s in the gameâ€™ huh? Or is it in the amount of money you can funnel from us? I guess weâ€™ll never know.

512	0	a	Great game to play if you are not planing on spending money on it. If you are planing to spend money on it DONT, waste of money and its just fkin squeezing money out of you with no rewards for you.
513	0	a	Are the massive lag issues fixed yet?No?Are the ingame prices fixed yet?No?Is the game any better?A bit?Oh my...
514	0	a	Take GTA V and maybe some other 3rd Person Shooter and this is what you get. But worse. Very worse, since its nowhere near GTA V and you can't mod on this game.
515	0	a	This game is buggy even with decent hardware. Apart form that, it has tons of security holes which means hackers can easily deface this game. And the punkbuster is a wase of time. Plus, it has become a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pay to win.
516	0	a	I do not recommend this game for now, that is because its full of aim bots and other stuff. Also the fps drops need to be fixed
517	0	a	Used to be fun back at the day but let's have a review shall we? No? Well go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself. This game used to be the best back when it came out. It's like GTA but free version and pay to win version. As you spawn... you look ugly af and ugly â™¥â™¥â™¥ car. Not even a car! Just steal one. But then you see other people with awesome â™¥â™¥â™¥ guns, cars, outfits. Can't do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pretty much. Well... dissapointed..
518	0	a	People give this game a bad review for the wrong reasons. The reason this game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is the fact that everyone has fixed hitbox and no mater where you hit them on their body you are going to do the same amount of damage. This means that the combat just comes down to rock paper scissors.
519	0	a	If your a hacker. Play this game cause there literally is no hacker prevention here. If your a regular player, avoid this game at all costs. Until removal of all hackers, game will remain bs unless played with friends.
520	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
521	0	a	The customization on this game is really good i must admit for quite an old game.  Pretty fun at start rekting people. Occasionally you get them hackers... not fun.  However, I really Hate the weapons that have this 30 day buy deal or Permenant deal for a certain price which then gets expired. It REALLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in sucks and not a great system imo. It also sucks how you buy a perk in the game; For example, the Car Sufer mod, when i bought it with earned money inside the game i was so excited and I thought it was permenant? But nope. It wasn't. It really sucked.. Quit after that happened.  You play deathmatch and people have Rocket Launchers = instant death. Not fun. This game has died out many years ago. Wish they didn't sell it to this new company.. But heyho.. it happens. Buisness is Buisness.  In the end, I played this game since the beta and just recently got back into it. I have 85.8hrs in total and I would recommend this game if you have friends its really fun. But soloing is pretty boring after a while.  Other than that I dont think this game is worth playing anymore. It has had it's chance and it failed.
522	0	a	Tried this game a while back for the costumization and cops vs robbers theme. It has seriously an impressive costumization feature by any game. However it's more like terrorists vs terrorists than cops and robbers rp.   More importantly, this game is the worst case of pay to play in an mmo I have ever seen. Literally only stock gear and few cars and useless clothes (no armor) are reasonably obtainable without hashing out real $. So unless you plan on throwing your cash at this game to buy ridiculously overpriced in game items and costumization features, don't waste your time. Furthermore, the divide between players who don't pay to play and the pay to play ppl is bigger than the divide between the rich and poor in a corrupt dictatorship. And you have the major hacker problem. This game is the king of rage quit and bullsh**  Seriously, this is a game that had huge potential and went horribly wrong. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, OR SANITY ON IT
523	0	a	This game is fun and all, it's just that there's so much that could be fixed. There's way too many hackers in this game and the developer's just made an automatic ban system to ban the hacks that are known to the system.   Also let's say that you've played 6 missions in a row, won them all, great stats &amp; all that. Your next mission can cause you to quit the game entirely because of bullsh!t game mechanics killing you, enemy team teaming up and playing the game way too competitive or just get tickled to death by a nano or whatever.   I've had so much fun in this game but now it's just like tip of a pen that's running out of ink. No more ink = No more fun.  I wouldn't recommend this game to any of my friends unless they've played it and can handle or have experienced utter sh!t mechanics f*cking you over and over again.  If there wasn't any customization in this game i would've never spent all the hours that i have now.
524	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game do not play it you get banned for nothing and it's a ip ban I do not know one game what does that and plzz delete form steam â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you APB
525	0	a	Had a lot of bugs, was hoping it would be similar to GTA or another open world game, I weas disapointed. It was very hard to move, very buggy, and laggy. Was not impressed with this game. 
526	0	a	I have played this game when it was released. Paid somewhere between 100 to 500 USD on items, upgrades, extra's, you name it. I had a wonderful time playing this game. Until... I got banned. I sended a ticket to support and they said that I got caught cheating which is kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, because I was livestreaming on Twitch.tv and anybody saw how I played and how my opponents played.  I even sended the following proof of someone using an aimbot who had 51 kills 7 deaths :   http://imageshack.com/a/img922/9103/0DtOEP.png   http://imageshack.com/a/img923/1844/mMXMvK.png  But they didn't care. I checked for APB Aimbot on Youtube and I found tons of videos of people using an aimbot in the game and they still play in the game based on the date they publish their brand new hack video compared to legit players, paid or not paid for extra items, gets banned with no reason what so ever.  This was somewhere in the year 2012. 4 years later I write my review to help others not to buy this game.  It's up to you if you want his game or not. Check the reviews 15k positive vs 7k negative.

532	0	a	There wasn't a game my old computer couldn't run. There wasn't a game it could run well, either. I could have bought the highest end graphic intensive game that existed, and it would still atleast /run/ at the minimum, sure, I wouldn't probably see a frame past the first, but it wouldn't crash and it most definitely would run everything. This, however, is an exception. This said that 'This computer couldn't run this' which was a first for me. It should atleast let you play the game even if you aren't optimized to.
533	0	a	APB Reloaded is like GTA and Infestation had a baby. Its a robber vs. cops type of game. You team up with people on the same side of yours (cops or robbers) to do missions. The customization on this game is big! You can customize your car, character, and your guns skins. But there is a plus side to this game. It a pay to win game. Most the guns you buy expire in 10 days, when you customize your clothing or car you can't add too many things unless you pay.
534	0	a	I dont write alot of reviews for games like these, but found it necesarry at this point. The game is breathtaking in its world and has a great character customization. The community (atleast for me on the EU servers, im an expat from america) was horrible. The matchmaking paired me up with Gold level players over and over and over and over again. I was getting my a** handed to me 100% of the time i played this game. Even though the game isnt pay to win, you still cant buy a gun forever. You have to renew it every 10 days. Unless you pay real money, you cant really connect to a gun and know you have it forever (which i kinda like when i play shooters, im not adaptable like that with my guns). And the problem with the gold players they match me with 100% of the time on every district is these people have maxed out everything, and put 100 bucks into the game. Besides those points, APB is a great game and I do recommend it if your ready to get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ handed to you for 24 hours and on.
535	0	a	apb reloaded is a game for people who like 3rd person shooters, if i were you i would get membership becuase you make money faster and also unlocks more. You can play without membership but takes alot longer to make money and get things. The maps are fun to explore but the mishions are for the most part the same:( if you have GTA 5 and you think its the same you are wrong its alot different, if you wanna be a cop it takes longer to make money i learned that the hard way... be a robber/enemy what ever you like to call it lol just my opion. BUT the game is mostly PAY TO WIN if you have no money RIP if you do spend it.    10/10
536	0	a	Not even a single real content update since launch. Just silly guns who are recycelt from resources even the cars+kits  However, this game isn't pay2win. But 'Gamersfist' has horror politics. They just deliver guns every mouth witch are Overpowerd, so everybody goes buy a gun for 40â‚¬(no kidding). After some time, they start nerf these guns + release new one staight up.    Enjoy the recycle simulator 2010-2020

542	0	a	BRONZE district (made for noobies bronze players) full of high rank silvers ex gold and pro gld players  SILVER district(made for awarage players) full of GOLDEN HACKERS  GOLD district(made for the bests) there is 2 players (which are friends) farming for achiwment  So if u dont have hacks or sopro mlg skillz try playing in green district   PS :i have like 2+k hours on gamerfirst before this game came on steam ..so enjoy BTW this is biggest P2W give 50euros and u have high rate of firing machine sniper without recol good for cars and people..have fun  
543	0	a	Great concept, poor execution.   If you're lucky, you'll have a good, fair experience with other free players. However, you'll probably match up with some premium guy with an LMG and a rocket launcher, effectively eliminating your chances at victory or a good time.  The biggest problem is the developers with the pay2win style.  If this was remade by literally anyone else I'd prefer it to GamersFirst.
544	0	a	How can this game be on Steam? There is lag every day and the game is so unbalanced, ritteled with P2W weapons, yes, P2W. Some people claim that the weapon are situational, which is true to some extent, but overall there are a selection of weapons that picked over other weapon because they are generally superior to other weapons.   This game should be removed from Steam because it does not reach the quality that Steam should require from games. The developers are ignoring all the problems, gold servers are never used, the threat system is completely broken, gold players play on Silver districts and silver players play on Bronze districts.  The amount of players who use aimbot and triggerbot are staggeringly high. Every day you run into someone who kills an entire opposed team with secondary weapons. I don't understand why they don't change the anti-cheat system when the current one is obviously a total failure.  This is APB: server lag, weapons that are op(like ATAC, which they intentionally do not nerf, just to sell it for a while), fun as hell when there are no cheaters(car chases, fast-pased action), cheaters, griefers, stutter-lag, broken match-making, broken threat system, in-depth customization...  The cons far outweighs the pros, so remove it!

575	0	a	When developers make a game free-to-play, the goal is to make it fun and fair for people who dont want to pay, but allow for bonuses for when you DO PAY. This game is STRICTLY pay to win. Impossible to do anything at all from the very start as a free to play player.  EDIT: You get completely destroyed by all the other geared up players as a beginner, and the game offers nothing to give you even the slightest bit of an edge in combat until payed for.

578	0	a	Possibly one of the worst communities I have ever experienced in a game. The general population of the servers expect you to know every aspect of the game before you even create your first toon and are unforgiving as you undertake the steep learning curve. I know I am not an elite player, but with time I am sure I could get the gist and hold my own in this 3rd person shooter, but the constantly being kicked out of groups moments before the final stage of a mission just shatters any illusion of enjoyment.  As an Australian player I already have to deal with a 200+ ping and in any pvp environment that will create problems but the lack of understanding/empathy from the APB community seals the deal for me. I will take my money elsewhere, I am sure there are many other 3rd person shooters that have an active friendly community. If this is how the game is currently running I don't really see a future for it as new players will be crushed by the overwhelming amount of arrogant, immature elitists.

583	0	a	APB Reloaded is quite the interesting game. It's a fast paced 3rd person shooter MMO in a somewhat open world. I've enjoyed this game since 2013 (ah, the good old days.) The game itself is very buggy and can make no sense at all when it comes to combat sometimes. But if you actually get the hang of how the gun mechanics work then you should be set. Ad the driving, oh man the driving. these cars are hard as hell to drive. either too slow, too fast, car gets blown up too easy, can't blow up an enemy car cause it's too armored. This game requires a lot of skill and a buttload of learning. I say try it out and try to get past rank 60 and you might get addicted. And that stuff about being pay2win is all nonsense. the joker CR 5 has the same exact stats as an ntech. The difference is that you buy the joker CR 5 with real money. And if you actually pay for some of the packs, they come with awesome cars, clothes, and weapons. Every gun that is on the armas market (the place you go to spend real money) has different variant at the joker store (ingame store to buy guns with ingame currency). And speaking of gear, the customization is endless. Do you want to look like a soldier? A maid? A racer? Someone fro myour favorite franchise of games? you can do it all. I would recommend buying premium with this game. You get more contact standing, more money, and discounts on pretty much everything in the armas marketplace. You also get waaaaay more room to customize. It goes from a nonpremium member only having room to use 25 shapes to a symbol, to a premium member being able to use 100 shapes. I love this game and it has a special little home for me and a lot of the veterans on this game. Also, this was originally made by the people that made crackdown, so you'll notice some similarities.  TL;DR  Pros- no limit to creativity, be who you want there are quite a bit of nice people in the community, they just don't talk addicting super fun with friends cool guns cool cars  cons- The playerbase is usually extremely salty and mean they push you to buy stuff a lot it is very hard for a beginner to enjoy because it's an odd game mechanics can break and ruin everything too many bugs (can't do a mission because the mission just breaks for no reason) very, very, veeeery grindy game  As much as I love it. I only love this game because I've been playing it over the years and it is unique. Other than that it's a meh game.
584	0	a	a weird version of gta. not much fun. a lot of annoying pop ups saying: you need new jeans click here to buy new jeans for your character. to buy things you pay with your own money and everything you need to buy so not really good.
585	0	a	great game! great customization, very fun  1) pay2win -3,0 2) terrible optimization -2,0 (you will need to buy a computer directly from nasa to play this, and you may still get lowfps)  my opinion: VOTE 5.0/10

588	0	a	I really can't say I would recommend this game. The biggest issue I take with the game is the fact that the majority of the equipment you can purchase in the game (guns, cars, etc.) are time-based/temporary if you purchase with in-game currency. If you want to keep the weapon for good, you have to purchase it with real money (which defeats the purpose of this game being  F2P ).  To make matters worse, I would run into griefers/hackers every day &amp; decided the game just wasn't worth it after a short amount of time playing it. I came back to it a few times trying to look past the obviously flaws, but just didn't keep my interest &amp; I decided I was done with it.  If you don't mind micro-transactions, griefers &amp; hackers, then this game may be acceptable to you, but I for one don't have a place for it in my gaming library anymore...
589	0	a	I have a 6 month old gaming PC with a top shelf GeForce GTX card and the game errors out at start that my graphics card is not supported. Waste of time downloading and not worth my time trying again in the future.

594	0	a	Spent three hours in a mock demolition derby and poledancing on top of other people's cars, paid off cops who pulled me over for speeding with a safe full of diamonds I'd just stolen right in front of them, 20/10 would play again.   To be honest, 9.5/10 people who try to play APB are going to be slavering at the jaws with rage within 15 minutes of entering their first server. The game is heavilly PvP orientated... Unfortunately, the PvP is weighted heavilly in favor of anyone who pays exorbant sums of money for the best gear. Not to mention the highly experienced, well-geared high levels that come to the starting areas to murder new players.   In terms of concept and general gameplay, APB is a wonderful game. Imagine an MMO version of Saints Row or GTA, with players being both criminals and cops. That's the general idea behind APB Reloaded. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, the player versus player that is cventral to the concept is horribly unbalanced. To give you an example, a fresh player with reasonable third person shooter experience can pick up a weapon off the real money market and dominate matches just like that. Now imagine an experienced player with that same weapon. It's one of those cases of a free-to-player attacking a paying player and the paying player essentially going 'Lol, stop it, it tickles! Here, have some bullets!'   I've touched on the subject a bit already... The game's community. To be frank, APB's community is utterly terrible, filled with asshats, trolls, and plenty of children who think they're MLG level hot stuff. Combine this with that pay-to win imbalance... Yeah, a ten year old with his daddy's credit card will kick your â™¥â™¥â™¥ more times than you'd care to admit. And both children and adults will announce their pro skills and taunt each other and whine about Haxoorz in the chat. Oh yeah. Hackers. They're there. Not as much as a lot of the people in the game would tell you they are (Every time they die) but they're definately there and a force to be reckoned with.   Did I mention the customization?   I didn't mention that, did I? silly me.   The level of customization you can apply to your character and vehicle is... Mind-boggling. Simply glorious. It's the main strength of the game, in my opinion, but unfortunately it's subscribed to that same Pay-to-win philosophy as the rest of the game... Less so, however. Put enough time into it, and you, as a free to player, can potentially look just as cool as that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who sunk 2000 bucks into his kit. He may be able to one-shot you with his god-pistol from a mile away, but hey, at least you'll leave a cool-looking corpse!   My advice for playing this game? Avoid actually playing the game like you're supposed to. Don't play the PvP, you're bound only for frustration and rage. Do side activities, They award more cash faster and, while they can get a bit monotonous, there's plenty of ways to stay entertained. Remember what I said about the demolition derby? Actually happened. There's plenty of people in the game that are just as bored as you. Oh, yeah, there are decent people, it's just that the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s are pretty loud. Criminals can make cash a lot faster than Enforcers, simply because their activities are largely dependant on the envirionment- mugging, robbing stores, jacking cars, you get the picture- whereas most of the Enforcer's income is largely dependant on criminals. And that PvP. You want cash as an enforcer? Gotta engage criminals in PvP to get it. Which is probably why the beginner areas are always swamped with high-level Enforcers. They want some easy cash.   Honestly most of this game's problems can be traced back to the Pay-to-Win PvP and the Enforcer's lack of quick cash income. THe only way to really have any fun with this game is to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around. As a free-to-player, attempting to take the game seriously will only end in your frustration.   I rate the game's premise 9/10, but the game in it's current state 3/10.   TL;DR: You're going to die to kids with their daddy's credit card a lot. Look forward to a toxic community and lots of salt in the area chat 24/7. Hey, the character customization is really kick-â™¥â™¥â™¥, though!

600	0	a	One of the worst games i have ever played, do not play this,
601	0	a	What a horrible game, after installing the game, I waited close to five minutes for it to finally load. Then, with the limited choices available for character creation, alot in list, but not all available; then finally, when ready to start the game, it FREEZES, to the point that it wouldn't even let me shut it down with task manager, wouldn't even let task manager window come up. I actually had to log out of my computer account for the stupid game to let me OUT.
602	0	a	This game is one huge piece of greedy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. All it does is steal money from you to give to some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s working from their mom's basements making fun at everyone.  Don't in a gazillion years buy this game or anything made from these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.
603	0	a	If you play this game without pay RIP or rather Rest In Grinding. Unless you pay for this game, you will find yourself grinding hour after hour. The customization is horrible if you are not a premium player. You should probably not play this game if your going to not play as a premium player. It was fun while it lasted. RIP APB and RIG all non prem players.
604	0	a	  This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!   This game is made to suck money from their players. The company doesn't fix things they just release more pay to win content, The game is a great idea and since its a great idea and sometimes has great matches it makes you want to play it more, But in the long run just uninstall it and leave it be and wait for a better APB.  
605	0	a	this game susks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the game runs wores than a fat chick runing a 50mil long track

609	0	a	If they would replace the mechanics with gta's it would have been a great game,as it stand's now it's not great.
610	0	a	Have you ever had a moment in your life where you're excited and ready to go? Starting APB was like that for me. I made my character, grabbed a gun, and went out into the world of gang violence.  Much like real gang violence, I was repeatedly brought low by people who bought better weapons than I could, could use the same weapons I had to better effect, and was matched up in a 'fair' fight against people who were like gods to me as an ant. even my car could best be described as a thin plastic shell around a chunk of explosive that functioned as an engine. Within 16 hours of gameplay, I had made every possible worst decision, from choosing a shotgun with the spread the size of a small house, to attempting any sort of PvP at all when close-quarters fighting meant gangbangers instantly ending my life repeatedly with SMGs and sniper rifles, while assault rifles were used to pick opponents off from 100 meters away. Any attempt at buying improved weaponry to escape the hellish catch-22 of ranking up to get new weapons was met with a paywall, and those who bought these rank-exempt weapons were unto demigods in their own right, as these 'same but different' weapons had the characteristics of their real life counterparts. Which, of course, meant they could actually kill you, unlike the peashooters and feather guns regular players are given. All in all, it's the standard Korean MMO pay-to-win format, but with guns and cars. Good if you need to be humbled or have the reflexes of a supercomputer.
611	0	a	I played this game for more hours that I'm proud to admit (over 1000), even before Reloaded 'revived' it, and way before it was in Steam.  So here's my humble review...   THE GOOD
612	0	a	I would like to say this is enjoyable as a Cops and Robbers game. I really would. However, this game boasts: an unnaturally spiteful, venomous community; misleading, restrictive pay-to-win microtransactions that holds too much sway over making-or-breaking the game; non-user-friendly technical support that somehow encourages more trolling and hacking than is present any other game; and boring, repetitive missions that have less flavour than any other MMO or shooter.
613	0	a	After much more time on this game I can neither recommend or say no to it.   IF you're looking to just kill time and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with friends this is for you.  If you're looking for a deep competitive f2p shooter with no p2w aspects and a long lifespan this isn't for you.  Presently APB is really not that great. There are many problems with the game and it really will make your experience terrible. First the grinding is ridicolous. It doesn't matter that you can get money as a criminal by raiding for money, or just mugging, it takes a really long time to get cash still and you run the risk of losing it all. If you're an enforcer you really can only make cash by doing missions and that's all. Premium gives you and extra 3rd Premium cash bonus and it helps a bunch. Instead of playing for 5 days to get like 150k you can only play for just 3 if you are getting top of the leaderboard each time.  Gameplay wise, it's fun. Guns all have different feelings to them and the game encourages you to use different tactics to approach situations. Teamwork is also recommended but generally be good at game strats and you can win. Sadly this game is terribly unbalanced. Guns have been getting changed constantly and some of the high end ARMAS weapons which require real money are sometimes better than the default weapons you can get by just playing and the claims about this not being true are mostly from rabid APB fans who have played the game for years and will defend anything the dev does.   Customization is fantastic and is really varied but you can't do much without premium. You get about 3 whole layers of customization for clothing and 6 for cars and that's all. With premium you get like 50 for both and it's honestly a joke. Premium isn't worth just this but the problem is if you get say a week of premium and you make this awesome looking piece of clothing, dont try to change it or fix it after that week because you wont be able to wear that piece of clothing unless you take off all the excess layers sadly. Premium is very badly done and the game has absolutely no incentives to have it other than less money grind and better customization.  Optimization is frankly AWFUL. I use a pretty medium-high end PC and I can get 60+fps on most games but this game is terrible optimization wise. I'm getting 40-50 frames and worse when big fights are happening. I'm fine with 30FPS but when it's a fast shooter like this, it's very unnatural to have framerate that constantly changes. They promised an engine change but that is unknown to when it'll be released.  Community is also legit terrible. It's full of a bunch of APB elitist who defend the game no matter what happens. Say one bad thing and you're attacked by a bunch of children who try to defend this 'perfect game' calling you a moron and to stop crying.  Frankly this game is not worth it if you want to play on and off. You won't get much from the game if you play like that as it requires constant grinding for money to get better gear, and ranking up to Rank 255 frankly is a nightmare unless you play for straight hours on end. Playing this game free is alright. It's not as bad as other games but it takes a lot of time to gain money like I said, and with a community that is toxic, bad balancing, and other issues on hand this game isn't really worth your time if you want to play just for fun.
614	0	a	After two days, I have found the community is small and very rude to new players. More of that venomous pvp game mentality and you'll find yourself outgunned almost instantly. If you aren't playing this with friends, don't play it. You simply aren't a match for the team-ups that will come at you. Matchmaking is terrible and you'll always end up fighting someone with hundreds more hours than you.   If you're an old player and you get it, great, have at it. If you didn't play this for a year or years ago, don't start now.  Also, the cash shop is one of the more predatory, taking your weapons away every 10 days and making you re-buy them...unless you want to pay for the gun with about 30+ real dollars....or a car for that much. The prices on items are astronomical.

618	0	a	This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.
619	0	a	APB is like Donald Trump, exciting and amusing at first, but once you get past the bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it starts to dawn on you how bad they are.  I've had history with this game, and decided to come back. I was bored and needed something to do. Here's a synopsis of how a day in APB goes. 1. Take 30 minutes to log in. 2. Spawn into the world and I become Nightcrawler, with the ability to teleport short distances. 3. Steal a car, try to drive, go across everything but the road. 4. Ready up for a mission, it's a 1v1, guy is already at the objective as we start, i'm 200m away. 5. I meet up with the enemy with my default weapon, fps and lag cooperate to make me spray like hell and somehow get a kill 6. Repeat. 7. Enemy corner Camps objective. 8. He wins. 9. Try to get a better weapon. 10. Don't have enough money. 11. Only way to get a lot is to do missions. 12. I realize I can't do missions with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gun. 13. I try anyway. 14. Guy with shotgun shoots my car while I'm stuck trying to get out of a wall. 15. I blow up. 16. Deletes APB. If you have a beefy computer and like to spend money this game is for you.

621	0	a	This game is kinda like GTA, just not as polished, big or open-ended. Or....well okay it's not really like GTA at all, apart from you roam around shooting people and stealing cars. Battles are fought in a series of urban maps between two sides, Enforcers and Criminals.  The game has a really, really good character creation and customization system. You really can do so much, height and weight, facial structure, skin tone, moles and scars and all sorts. Clothes are the same, able eventually to be worn in a multitude of colors, with lots of different styles.  The bad points, IMHO, outweigh the good however. The community on this game is absolutely atrocious. Exploititive, foul-mouthed keyboard gangsters constantly filling the district chat with all manner of nasty comments and what is essentially verbal griefing. I can't really stress how awful this community is.  The second worst feature is the driving and combat. Cars are horribly unwieldy and slip and slide like you're driving on an ice rink. The combat is very annoying, as you -will- be destroyed by bouncing, aimbotting 'veterans' with P2W guns that you simply cannot match unless you want to fork out quite a large amount of money. The gunfights are not fun. They really on having suprise and killing within three seconds, any longer and the hyper accurate, ultra-damage gun wielding other players will kill you with suspicious accuracy.  I don't recommend this game at all. The community is a festering, weeping sore that is hopelessly entrenched, and the gameplay is either clunky or skewed horribly in the favour of pay-to-win veterans who scream gangster hood references over the chat at eachother while aimbotting and hacking the game. Avoid.  Not worth even being free.

624	0	a	Great game, horrible company. Don't trust your wallet and time with these guys, they have banned a lot of good people for doing absolutely nothing. Also, there is only one dev assigned to working on the game, so nothing is getting updated, ever (except for those $50 re-skinned guns that seem to come out every week).
625	0	a	After 1,700 hours of the same repetitive actions, no cover system or evasion system, Hackers galore, I'm giving up on APB. The game feels like it does when it was in Beta. Hardly any changes at all (there are changes but nothing that makes the game 'better' just more weapons added on to Armas to milk the Cash Cow that this game has become). Utterly dissappointed I spent so many hours of my life playing this game when I could have been doing something more cnstructive with my life. I highly recommend all to stay clear of the Trap that is APB: Reloaded and invest your time and money into something worth wild, and better, Like DayZ, or stocks from NASDAQ.

Any one in the area can pick a fight with you, and most likely they are 50 levels or more above you, have far better weapons, or even worse have payed wepons. That and aim bots that they have still yet to stop, makes a game not worth any one's time. Shouldn't have released this without fixing all of that first. I don't trust it, and never will trust it. All the creators care about is how good it looks. LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING!

650	0	a	What is it: APB reloaded is a small open world gta/saintsrow like cops and robbers free to play multiplayer game where you can create your character how ever you like race, gender, and features, and choose to be a cop or criminal with randomized missions to do with friends or random people and crash a van into stores and put all the goodies in the back of the van and sell it all to get money to get weapons, clothes, and cars.  What do i think: APB is a extreme pay to win money grabber after playing this game for a couple of hours i started to notice how repetetive it is once i started playing missions the missions started to repeat threres only like 10 missions i also found it a bit boring going back and forth with the van selling stuff to get money. and also my biggest pet peive with this game is that you cant buy weapons perminantly you are forced to rent weapons for a limited time only. and there are only at least 10 cars in the game i see cars repeat and repeat on the road like 4 of the same cars in paralell parking together.  Pros: - fun (but not for long) - good gameplay and driving handeling  Cons - dull and boring - small open world - no permanent weapons - repeating cars - not alot od missions - pay to win  The vertict: as much as a cool idea APB reloaded is it is a very boring money grabbing repetetive free to play game i am going to give APB reloaded a  RATING: 3/10

656	0	a	You pretty much just get tossed into this game with absolutely no clue what you're expected to do and somewhere between few and no tutorials to explain how to do it. After fumbling around my first five minutes, I eventually picked up a quest to go capture some criminal....on the other side of the city. With no car to drive to him.   Ten minutes of running later, I realize this guy is moving. Five minutes later I realize it's another PC i'm chasing. 5 seconds later i'm dead, and I respawn halfway across the city from my target.   I was done at that point.
657	0	a	Bought APB when it originally came out, glad that's it's 'free2play', shame that it's now 'pay2win', and if you wanna win, it's not cheap. One thing I really do love in this game: Customisation. There is so much customisation in this game; customising you're custom character with custom items that can be customised with custom created patterns, that's a seriously impressive amount of customisation. Which is why I don't understand, with the wealth of cosmetic options available, why all the 'real money' items can't just be the 'cosmetic' ones. From tattoos to new hair styles to the 100's of clothing items (of which more can be created) and bazillions of combinations that this gives you, there is surely enough content there to continue to fund this game without selling overpowered weaponry. Path of Exile does it. Path of Exile doesn't even have much customisation. But no. pay2win Well, you'll have the occasional fun match with equally skilled, equally equipped players, but only 'occasionally'. More than often, you'll be pitted against player's that have forked out for the massively 'over-powered-death-weapons-of-instant-death' weaponry, and then any skill you've aquired at playing well; will mean naught. If you've just won the lottery and want to spend it in a game where overpowered weaponry destroys all form of difficulty and balance then this is for you. If not, than you can still try the game out, it's 'free2play' after all, but I doubt you'll stay long.

The updates are fairly large and download slowly When you press the 'Start' button the first time, a new tab opens in your default browser that leads you to a page where you can 'Like' APB's facebook page. This cannot be disabled. It is stupid. So very, very, very stupid. No, I will not like this abomination's facebook page before I've even played the game, no matter how many times you open a new tab for me to do so. This also can cause active process issues and delay you. When I pressed start a SECOND TIME, the game attempted to launch. Apparently Nvidia PhysX is mandatory, because the game notes that it cannot access PhysX, and fails to start. (Read, screw you AMD users) I've seen games where PhysX can be enabled in the settings, never one where it's mandatory, and with good reason. Next it noted that it apparently could not access the registry keys it supposedly installed. Something that should not happen with a Steam Regulated install. This game is buggy as hell, poorly designed, and it seems their staff are doing absolutely nothing but creating an endless stream of overpriced overpowered novelty guns to try and sell you simply so you can remain competitive. 0/10 gr8 b8 m8

Even with the customization, every male character looks like an angsty edgy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and every female character looks like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥toy bimbo.  Surprisingly not pay-to-win, but everything in the armas market is overpriced to hell and back.  Most of the criminals are whiny 12 year olds who try to be edgy gangsters, and most of the enforcers are 30+ year old neckbeard manchildren who get in heated arguments with said edgy 12 year olds.  And the GMs do hardly anything at all.

666	0	a	Great game, horrible company. Don't trust your wallet and time with these guys, they have banned a lot of good people for doing absolutely nothing. Also, there is only one dev assigned to working on the game, so nothing is getting updated, ever (except for those $50 re-skinned guns that seem to come out every week).
667	0	a	I Would Rather Take A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, And Eat it Rather Than Play This God Awful Game That Really Sets The Line Between F2P And P2P
668	0	a	I played the Beta and even bought it when it was initially released and I loved the game and it was a huge disappointment when the company went under. I was obviously ecstatic when I heard the game had been picked up and re-released but I hadn't really played until recently. Now it's just crap. A clear case of pay-to-win. I've seen cash users shot in the head multiple times with a burst fire rifle and survive, taken direct grenades and survive, seen their cars getting loaded up with Alig and grenade fire and survive. Then on the flip side I've seen just one of their grenades take out a vehicle, kill someone by just being near the blast and destroying people from long range with an uzi type weapon.   I'm not totally sure what happened to this game but it has no real balance from what I witnessed and have been hearing. I am also aware of a lot of promises that players were given for new content and then not fulfilled. Kind of seems like this game is just here to suck in peoples cash dumb enough to pay at this point. Oh, What could have been :/ R.I.P APB 
669	0	a	APB is one of those game where you enjoy and like it but you still can't recommend it because it has some issues. I'm just gonna list the pros and cons so you don't have to kill yourself after reading this review.  Pros ======= - Customization, you can do anything really. - Ragdoll physic - You can play with your friends  Cons ======= - Terrible matchmaking, have fun going against 3 golds with 2 silvers on your team - Pay2Win effect is present though to a lesser extent - Unoptimize even after 4 years, one of the feats that makes me wanna jump off the Eiffel Tower - Hackers are present but not much - A lot of reskin weapons like seriously? - Where is the engine update? - Server can be a bit laggy at times (yes, I already check it. It isn't my internet)  TLDR ========== - Play the game if you want, I'm not gonna stop you. It has its problem but it's enjoyable, atleast for me, I suppose.
670	0	a	This game is the representation of cancer, ebola, aids, hiv and above all, pay to win. In all seriousness it has a ton of bugs, bad features, poor implementation, bad mechanics, the community is the worst and overall the experience is very, very poor. I would only recommend this game to someone who is only looking for a game where they can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around in an open world, because if you are looking for competitive gameplay this is the worst game in the history of open world free to play games. Warframe for example handles the payed features much better because they do not allow you to win over all oponents like you are a 500 pound bodybuilder fighting against tiny baby cats. Overall the game is at all points unplayable, unbalanced, and not enjoyable at all. Please do not play this until the developers decide to actually make something playable out of this so far poorly designed game. The community has been dying for a reason. Wake up you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.
671	0	a	its pretty bad

679	0	a	it takes forever to load up the game and even then its buggy the anti cheat system doesnt work at all even though they have been doing this for fifteen years and even when there are no cheaters the game crashes and for no reason punkbuster say you have been cheating even when your not .  so all in all i do not reccomend this game because it is cheap and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gta . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND OR TIME
680	0	a	How can this game be on Steam? There is lag every day and the game is so unbalanced, ritteled with P2W weapons, yes, P2W. Some people claim that the weapon are situational, which is true to some extent, but overall there are a selection of weapons that picked over other weapon because they are generally superior to other weapons.   This game should be removed from Steam because it does not reach the quality that Steam should require from games. The developers are ignoring all the problems, gold servers are never used, the threat system is completely broken, gold players play on Silver districts and silver players play on Bronze districts.  The amount of players who use aimbot and triggerbot are staggeringly high. Every day you run into someone who kills an entire opposed team with secondary weapons. I don't understand why they don't change the anti-cheat system when the current one is obviously a total failure.  This is APB: server lag, weapons that are op(like ATAC, which they intentionally do not nerf, just to sell it for a while), fun as hell when there are no cheaters(car chases, fast-pased action), cheaters, griefers, stutter-lag, broken match-making, broken threat system, in-depth customization...  The cons far outweighs the pros, so remove it!
681	0	a	I could write a long review explainging in detail its failures and succsesses but i'll be short. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO BE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ED IN THE BUTT BY HACKERS. Unless you are a hacker yourself then i recommend this game 10/10 hackingsimulator 2014  This game will will put your hacking skills to the limit. can you outhack your oponent? (enter epic battle music of your choice) Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME
682	0	a	What is this? It's a sort of 'Cops and Robbers', where one team has to do an objective, the other has to prevent them (or they both compete to have control over the same objective).  On paper this seems great! You get to fully customize your character, your vehicle, even a special theme for when you are MvP or kill another player! A variety of weapons, equipment, and the open world style of the game allow for a lot of neat missions!  So why is this bad? Well for one, there seems to be little to no moderation involved. I've lost count how many times I saw somebody snap to everybody in sight, or shot through a wall, etc.  Another huge issue is the concept of 'Pay 2 win'. There are a lot of neat weapons, but the best ones are for sale with REAL MONEY. I could understand for reskins, but these are literally straight upgrades to normal in game weapons.  And in terms of the customizations? A lot of players tend to just make half-naked characters (no styling, just underwear), same copy-paste vans, and usually some kind of theme made to make your ears bleed, making it painful at best to play against other characters.  Loading is also a horror... If you go too fast (which, given the nature of CARS) you can actually out run render distance, and in turn you will be driving and suddenly cars and even possibly buildings can just appear out of thin-air.  Even looking past these, in terms of gameplay it's missions are fundamentally flawed. Forget that you did the first 4 parts of a mission flawlessly, they managed to win by just running away for 5 minutes straight after the fact. Instead of it being 'A does B, and C must stop them', it does that until the final stage, in which it generally seems to become whoever is best at running or knows the most ridiculous spots to put objects. This gives a team that should have lost a free win more often than not.   Overall, a great concept but a terrible game.

685	0	a	Got banned out of nowhere.... Contacted dev's got a bs copy and paste email.  Got with a real person. and they told me why I got banned. and that was it  they said I was hacking but when I asked what I was doing and what proof they had they ignored me.   Pros -  Awesome game   Cons - Pay2Play Random Bans from mods who dont like you.
686	0	a	Weak gameplay, riddled with cheaters with no obstacles to stop them. I could literally download hacks and play on the servers with a very small risk of being banned. The devs are so inflated they literally boast in the chat that they have banned one person from the server. The gunplay is weak, vehicle mechanics are choppy, cluttered ui, difficult learning curve(minus cheaters) and looks as though they don't put enough attention into the aspects of the game that really matter. When they start focusing on improving the mechanics while also establishing a viable anti cheat then i will consider this game to be mediocore.

688	0	a	You know how when a horse breaks its leg, you're supposed to shoot it? Yeah, that was APB from the start. And then they tried to perform necromancy on it. But that didn't fix its broken leg. Now it's just rotting AND crippled.  Sure, you can dress your zombie horse up however you want. Give it a little hat. Try to pretend it's alive and well. But the truth remains; It's not. Every moment it exists is a plea to stop its unending torment.

690	0	a	Matchmaking does not exist.  30 min in i started fighting gold rank people. Pay2Win (inbefore: OMEGED ITS NOT PAY2WIN LIRN TO PLAY). All gold rank people play in bronze/silver rank servers (gold rank servers are EMPTY, wonder where they all are hmmm, oh right).  You will be sniped from every corner possibe. Mission objectives will be taken on rooftops with 1 entrance where you will get rekt all the time trying to get up there. Much more can be added. I simply won't waste my time. Don't believe me? then proceed.
691	0	a	This game can not play anymore -_-

696	0	a	I absolutely do not recomend this game to ANYONE. This idea that criminals are taking over the city with the police in dissaray, but a new act is passed which allows a militia police force of sorts can fight the criminals is exciting. I picked this game up on the idea of 'Oh why not, it is free' only to be greeted by a game that took an eternity to download. I had to download this download that, do this third party application, taking me an hour to finish! Could you do it through steam instead!? I then said 'After all of this the game better not suck' and oh boy.... I will start with the positives. A HUGE customization system that i have never seen before, being able to modify character height, muscularity, you name it, it is there. It doesnt end there because you can customize your clothing as well with decals (I made the LVMPD uniform dont judge) You can customize your car and it is the most fun i have had in this game. Now the negatives.....where to start. When i first did a mission, I was happy as the game was kind enough to put me with decent people. After that, I was thrown into games with people who had better gear than i did, had more skill than me, and used every dirty trick in the book against me, a guy who just started the game! The matchmaking is awful! You will be cursing and raging at how much you die because the game puts you with better equiped and skilled people. On to the combat system. It is awful, just awful. Please tell me how a guy with an smg can get the same accuracy on the move as a guy aiming with an assault rifle? You will constantly be saying, 'How did he not die?!' or 'How the hell did I die!?' There is no headshots in the game because you know, shooting someone in the foot is the same as shooting them in the head right? There are no balanced hitboxes. you can make your character as small as you wish but you will have the same hitboxes as a tall person. WTF!? Veteran players abuse this 'ghost shotting' and you will be left scratching your head how you died. Also, the missions are extremely limited to a few modes. King of the hill, conquest, team king of the hill, car capture the flag (hotwire), and capture the flag. The mission descriptions themselves are also rediculous and are real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ reasons to send the SWAT team, FBI tactical teams, ATF tactical teams for a pile of pirated video games?! Does it seriously take an entire Special Weapons and Tactics Team to raid a place for a couple boxes of pirated video games? Apparently it does because the criminals decide to defend a couple hundred dollars of damn pirated games. What i'm trying to say is that some situations you are put into, make no logical sense at all. Since this game is F2P, there are microtransactions, you should expect that. But here is the problem, instead of fixing a broken combat system and a multitude of latency problems and crap driving, they are adding new unbalanced guns to the F2P gun store. Another thing i will add, the community here is almost entirely unfriendly to ANYONE. In missions, instead of coordinating with team mates, they stay quiet just going in random directions and getting shot. At the end, they blame their team for being crap when they didnt do anything to coordinate. I was teamkilled by OTHER POLICE FORCES in a mission repeatedly. They will then go to insult you in the chat as well because you trying to coordinate in the game is a crime to these guys. These â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ers think that this is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Esports tournament and if they lose 1 match, they lose a chance at a million dollars. Playing solo like I did is TERRIBLE, dont do it because you cant rely on your team for anything, bring 3-4 friends with you. I could forgive a crappy combat system if the community is somewhat bearable but here, nearly everyone is an â™¥â™¥â™¥ or a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, there are only a few decent players and the game is fun when you get into games with them. However, getting into these games is super rare. I had a round with a really good guy that was one of the quiet ones but then opened up a little bit as me and him did missions a bit more. We were in a 2v2 and all parties were trying and it got so close, we almost won, and that was fun! What else? Oh there is a whole lot of hackers and they either aimbot or are the one shot kill types with AK 47s. To sum this all up, the community is crap, the combat system is broken, there are tons of bugs and glitches, the devs dont listen to other players on the forums and defend hackers, they dont fix the game, and it all boils down to it being a rage inducing Free to play MMO. Don't even waste your time.    Update at 2/21/2015: tried to play this game again after an update. Had a couple of good games, because i was lucky. Community is still a steaming pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Teamkilled by police forces.....again....called a 'dumbass' for not remembering every damn corner of the map. I hope this same community doesnt infest the other police sims out there. seriously most of the community sucks. I cannot seem to have fun in this game whatsoever but by pure chance. Im going to enjoy uninstalling this POS from my hard drive.
697	0	a	Recently hacks have been released again and the game is now dead every person a hacker. its hackers vs hackers. and now brazilians are allowed on NA SERVERS. but you know their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ favela ping wont affect out gameplay ohhh nooo dont worry g1. but seriously i didnt think it could get any worse till i say that. download it to expericne raw footage of the highest scum. Peace.  I decided to give a little more insite to never download this game......   Alright. I got lovely info for the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥sticks who wanna play this game. you mind as well get your doctor to live with you in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. got ltl camping double teamers hacking. oficially every person besides me hacks. Ik people who have just for the purpose decided to hack to see how many people actually wall hack. almost every person we faced was using aim bot. How badly could you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this gamers first. you dislexic or somthing? like your fairfight is actually â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t and works for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the game. just wanted to take one little peek from playing it a while ago to see this even worse. people just hack cause other hack. you dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ reatrds can easily fix the game but you wan tto sit on your â™¥â™¥â™¥ and do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Apb.  So ik somone who was banned technically by accident. so as he requested some support, they replied with this 'we will no longer receive emails from this account thank you'. so he spent like over 1000 dollars and he will never get it back. Also i was in game and i called this Gm out and asked him 'why did they do that to my friend'. he went silent and instead muted me for 3 days........ like??  You will often see people on these reviews saying they cant quit but they put a thumbs down like me. well just watch that south park episode when stan gets hooked on that free game app but spent thousands on it. Episode i think was called 'FREEMIUM' or somthing. Its basically that. ill urge anyone to not join this game. sure you win lots and you lose lots but when they ban a guy who â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ talks then gets banned the next day, but a hacker hacks for 6 months trigger bot and everything fully blatant hacker to get banned. idk you tell me.  Update 5 FINAL REVIEW UPDATE. Play to lose. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ This game. Had a little kid yell at me on Voip and i said one thing and he ignored me. best experience yet.  So ik i have like posted these reviews so close together but the first few were over some time. Officially im no longer going to play this game till the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Developers make a new god dam sever to put the ultra try hard reroles out of the game. its no longer fun. like this game will ruin you. I beg you dont play please god let this game die and let the company go bankrupt please. All it is, is rerolles that when you died once they tea bag you just cause they camped around a corner. This game has lost me as a player. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you gamerfirst suck C-O-C-K. Listen to you players and maybe you wont continue to lose people to these no life 30 year olds with no jobs and on welfare. True story to people who do not play and mostly mexicans for some reason on north amaerican servers. Good day. And please take this into consideration, iv never played a game where the community will make fun of you just for saying 'i have not gotten a good team in a while' it was like i was in court and i had to fight if i was gonna die or not. these people were like completley smothering me like i was a mass offender. im a player. who will never again play this game till i see change. Good day. #killapb  Update 4. Officially the worst game now.  So i come on and all it is is max rank golds that are 30 year old men â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ talking and all they say is you bro salty man lmao dude salty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THE WORD SALTY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ STOP USING THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING WORD. they say they are good and they have 30 000 hours on the game. like get a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing job. Sad. Die game just lay down in a dark hole and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing die.  Update 3.   I have 2 days off of work this monday and tusday and these no lifers play all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing day with shotguns like do they not have lives do they go to school or work or just sit on this game. This game is DONE this game is dead. DO NOT PLAY this game. you will want to shoot your self . all iut is is shotgunners that go back behind a wall and shoot over and over. like this guy i see him on 247 like he should be banned for how much he plays like honestly get a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing life. WORST GAME EVER 10/10. plus i play enforcers as myt main and the matches i was just put in was Max gold Max rank/level and my team was like level 50s and my like 200.(or whatever) like how is that okay Apb get your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sakes.  Update 2. I have decided to change this game back to not reccommended due to the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lagg and that if you start playing at night the ultra try hards come on. I just faced a group of 4 people with the bolt and attachments or cj3 and ect. At night there is no point in playing this game you will have no fun. i will no longer play after 8:30 cause all the 30 yo old dude come on with their whole team and go on team speak and like get this game so far up their â™¥â™¥â™¥ they can smell it. DEVS****** PLEASE implement a god dam platnum rank so they ultra try hards can leave. ill be honest im deacent at the game but since im in gold i face th etop players all the time and they are max gold 10s. there should be another rank that is harder to get into but puts those super try hards out of these servers. yeah i could play on bronze servers but its too easy and gold is too hard. so what else is there to do. FAZE OUT THE TRY HARDS INTO A NEW SERVER******* i have told this to people on apb and eveyrone says this is a great idea. but devs will do nothing so. Not reccommended. Have a fun time with my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ spelling. have a great day.   Update 1 .  After playing this game more i decided to change my review from no, to yes. due to the more experience you have in the game you start knowing whats good any whats not. its almost impossible to play on your own though as a begginer i will say that. but i met some people that were playing for a long time and joined them. I got to know more about the game and yes i did have some money dumped into my account. the game is still fun once you start getting things and i do enjoy that they give some promo codes away from time to time even if the things i get only last a while. The only thing i dont like is i guess that buying some of the things is a little expensive but thats what im just saying. i was going to buy one gun and it was on sale it was like 3000g1c or whatever and it came out to like 33$ to buy and i said forget that and didnt buy it for that reason. so buy it if you want a game to play and be ready to have a little frustration with some people who do buy op guns and you tempted to spend some as well. not saying the begginer gun is bad. it isnt if you know how to use it. There is lost of techniques.

706	0	a	APB Reloaded was a fun game at first, but things took a turn for the worse. The game is a huge pay-to-win, you have to buy in-game money to actually be able to even have a sliver of hope in winning PvP battles.  The verdict? Don't waste your time on this game.
707	0	a	I could write a long review explainging in detail its failures and succsesses but i'll be short. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO BE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ED IN THE BUTT BY HACKERS. Unless you are a hacker yourself then i recommend this game 10/10 hackingsimulator 2014  This game will will put your hacking skills to the limit. can you outhack your oponent? (enter epic battle music of your choice) Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME

713	0	a	It crashed my driver and graphic card and it broke gg would spend $500 agian
714	0	a	This game is the worst example of a Free to play (pay to win) game, the guns are so out of balance and unrealistic that even snipers don't have a scope view. the only thing that balances out weapons are weapon mods which are only available at a high level which is almost unreachable if you dont have 'premium' because by the time you would reach that  A; you falcon punch through the screen or  B; spend a butt load of cash on the game.   And the matchmaking should be shot and burried you will constantly fight against fully geared player who will Destroy that little, tiny, spec of fun the game has to offer.
715	0	a	This game worked once for me. ONCE. it was super laggy, i didnt know how to play the game and i got spawnkilled by a guy with a rocket launcher.    So whatever you do, dont waste your time on this stupid game. it could have been a good game but its just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. evreything is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
716	0	a	This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.
717	0	a	As of right now, I'm giving you a bad rating Gamersfirst. I've been loyal to you, spent over $60 on your great game. I love it to pieces, but today everyone was banned. Fix this, and I'll redo this review, and give you an honest rating about the game.

722	0	a	I have over 2 k hours on my account. Used to play and absolutely love this game. That was back in 2011 and 2012. I've stopped playing the game in 2013 because every patch the fps kept getting lower and lower. Basicly devs started working on engine upgrade to release the game on consoles and because optimisation was incompatible with upgraded engine they removed it. Or so I heard. Now in late 2013 they made a blog post saying that engine upgrade will come in Q1 of 2014 and it will improve the game visually and increase performance too. 2 years later engine upgrade still not released.  I used to get a steady 100 fps with no drops. Last I checked now my fps is 38-70. Usually arround 45-55 (even worse in Waterfront district) and it feels very unsmooth. Also at first the game used to run perfectly fine on 4 gb ram but in 2013 it started needing more ram and on 4 gb ram setups there were freezes and lags. I have upgraded to 8 gb ram. It was a day and night difference performance wise (no freezes) but this did not fix the fps issue. Since the game matchmaking is based on your skill it constatly puts you against similar skill level players. I simply got tired of losing fights even against lower skilled players simply due to the fact that my fps is unsmooth and keeps jumping. Got tired of waiting for an engine upgrade that is never released. Unless you have a i7 oc'ed to 4.5 GHz I do not recommend playing this game. Sure its doable at bronze and silver levels but once you hit gold threat all your fun will go away when you try to kill somebody with 144 fps on his i100 and 1000 gb of ram. Random server-side lag and teleportations do not help either.  Oh and back in 2013 EU1 had ~3000 active players and EU2 had ~1700. Now they merged EU servers together active population is even less of that that EU2 used ot have so the population speaks for itself. Perhaps in 2050 when Half - Life 3 is released and APB Reloaded receives it's engine upgrade I will remove this negative review and start enjoying the game again because right now it's impossible to do so.
723	0	a	tiggs bans legit accounts for no reason at all and steals your money (yes, do NOt buy armas or tiggs WILL steal your money, locking you out of your account for NOTHING)  yet she leaves closet hackers unbanned.  tiggs is destroying this game. low population because of hackers and instead of banning hackers they ban legit players who complain about the closets!

724	0	a	It has been a while since I played, it used to be a fun game, but I was tired of lag on here due to the tech people not knowing what the hell they were doing and screwing it up more and more with each update. I was going to try it again as my brother had convinced me to play because they fixed all those issues. However, after 11 and a half hours of downtime today, far past the original estimate they gave, and with them expecting another 3 hours on top of this, I can clearly see that the programmers still cannot program properly and I feel I must give up on this game again before I was even able to give it a second chance.   Update: So I finally get to try this again... only logs me in every other attempt.. game decides not to render my enemies till there is already a bullet in my head... oh, and I absolutly LOVE having to wait for 5 minutes after closing the game to get control of my computer back. So in conclusion, it is still broken, the programmers obviously still don't know what the hell they are doing, and I'm done with it. Not worth the headaches that come with it. Such a shame, waste of a decent idea and semi decent gameplay. But that's what most free to play is, great idea smashed to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in practice.
725	0	a	Deleted. I've tried to enjoy this so many times. But every time I play it just tends to make me really angry. The matchmaking, hacking, and the fact you cant leave a mission when your team mates aren't even playing was enough to finish it for me.   If they fix that stuff, I'd be interested in looking at it. Until they do, game over APB.
726	0	a	It's a terrible game the trailers are all lies some guns are too OP and the strategy to this game is to attack and run away there is no way i could take enjoyment out of this game mainly because its a big â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-canoe and it...Just sucks stay away from this
727	0	a	A lot of weapons are P2W and many say obtainable by F2P if you play long enough, but there IS weapons you can't get being F2P which a lot of people use and murder with, over all, if you want a good shooter, don't expect to be good even with amazing aim. :/  -Customization is amazing though, I'm sad it's crushed out by the horrid shooting mechs.
728	0	a	Pay 2 win, everwhere.
729	0	a	P2W. That's all.
730	0	a	One word to describe my experience in this game : Hackers   Another player openly admitted he was running hacks during gameplay and then proceeded to highlight every other player in the server running them for me. I didn't believe them at first but then after seeing what they could do there was no doubt these players are running hacks.  I thought when I saw the huge green banner saying 'Fair Fight' that is what I would get... WRONG!!  It is a Pay 2 Win game loaded with Hackers and Whales. The lag is so bad that I thought my keyboard was messing up but nope-- turns out all driving input is tied in with your latency so if you get a bad ping spike (which hackers exploit to no end) your vehicle becomes 100% uncontrollable.  Avoid this game at all costs. I would say to buy GTA V instead but they have the same issues and others with a worthless customer support team who avoid responding to tickets via any loophole they can think of even when not based on factual information.  Great game concept APB has .. terrible delivery.

740	0	a	the 1st prob is too much cheaters/hackers in the game! (that's the fact!) the 2nd prob is the shop's price is too much expensive like 50-60â‚¬ for 1 weapon or half price for haircut... and maybe idk some of the players are rich who knows? many of the players are full stuff with gold gear cars weapons... and the weapons are too much CHEAT the gold ones send u 10 bullets in 1sec (example) and the standard white gun in game is like you have a shotgun 80% damage in 1 shot and when u shot (all ammo off) those players under 5m they just kill you with handgun (gold weapon) like 2 shots without accuracy and keep running... the 3rd prob is technical i mean the game is unstable 'cause i'm playing on pc gamer and using fiber but have some trouble with the game stability or something... (i mean it's not perfect)  PS: i played over 300H so it's not just a beginners reaction!

745	0	a	i played to mutch of this game and i started to hate it after i found out that it was not that i sucked it was the shooting system the game has no head shots or weak points. that showed the reality for pay to win the more you pay for guns with real money the better you are in combat. it's impossible to get good guns for free. and if you get something remotely close to good you are limited to few weeks to own it. you can get free guns that last forever but to get one gun you need to play this for more than 40h and they will still suck (obs. if you see someone with fancy car or cool clothing that you need to fight, you better run). then we are done with guns, now we can go to customization the main thing that the game rubs in your face. Yea it's good but for non members you are limited to specific number of layers on eatch object. the music maker system is pointles couse most music that you can find from community is copies of edm and the samples you get to use sounds like form sega genesis (michael jackson's moon walker Was better than this). the cars just looks like chinese knock off of american and japanese cars. only the little plus isbattle arena wich is bit addictive but will make you angry after finding out the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wepon system i can't give a good score to this game couse of bad shooting system, good but limited customsation, pay to win system and badly made car models. i give 2/10 (better to download gta sa. with online mod or get gta 5)
746	0	a	Awesome concept terrible execution - be prepared for horrendous combat and vehicle mechanics with the only consolation being the in-depth customization of both personal vehicles and player avatars.

750	0	a	Gosh, this game is completely f*cked up! Matchmaking is utterly bulls*it. From the very beginning you need to play with highlevel characters and donaters. Donate, f*ck, it's terrible. It's not just 'pay to buy something faster than the others' it's completely 10000% Pay2Kicka*s. Customization in this game is just wonderful. It is the one reason why you should play this game, else DON'T EVEN TRY IT.  AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.
751	0	a	Here is what I think. APB Reloaded is a good Game, but I feel that I should both critisize and nit pick a lotta things about this game  One is the SMG charging and the repeditiveness to lose to another player because of the overpower of the SMG's in the game. It is so god awful and OP, It made me stop playing this all together. People would just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sprint at you, boomboom â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. They do it with shotguns even. It's stupid as all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, also, the new Argotech ACES R&amp;D III is the most OP weapon in the game, and the most unfair, it directly hits, no need for anything else, no range no nothing. People running around with OSMAW Bazookas and silly Argotech ACES SMGs are cowards and are idiots for buying something for a cheap kill every five seconds.   Two is the Customization, specifically for males. I generally have a Randy Savage-Esque Character, but I want more than a Randy Savage look. I want to see hair that will SURPASS my shoulder/neck. I want to see long where is surpasses the shoulders to even the top half of the Pectoral. I really do not care what the general style of man is, give us that choice please. I have a problem with games that never seem to give a choice about Hair style for men, and just give the more mainstream stylings and as I repeat, absolutely sick of it. I want to see a helluvalot more.  Three is the Car handling, which is GOD AWFUL. Simple, It's so unecessarily hard. Go around a corner, you hit a brick â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing wall in 12 seconds and then your dead.   Four... The â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing unbalancing of the 'threat levels'. Bronzies all in one, but goldies and silvers mixed together... this game is way under balanced and stupid. it just is horrifingly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I kept on getting my â™¥â™¥â™¥ handed to me because of the Goldies 'better skills' and there silly pay 2 win cheapo weaponry. This game HEAVILY relies on you having to buy weapons all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time and having them rented out instead of kept which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dumb. You basically are vulnerable as a cop or a criminal. Oh but the Enforcers (cops) have all the advantages of quickly getitng everything. Yeah. The Goods It's Free, so if you are looking for a filler game, go ahead, get this It has the Best customization, despite what I say about Male customization. Sometimes, you can win by using simple weaponry and stuff. SOme of the Pay 2 Win items are pretty good if you think about it. Most importantly, it is a co-opish game, so you can play with friends  Overall, If I were to rate tis on a simpler basis, it would be atleast a 5/10 Because of the new crap that G1 and Reloaded added.   Thanks Reloaded, you guys do not know anything about fairness.  Edit: I am putting on the thumbs down, but it's your choice. at this point I am in the middle. ANd the reason there is so much bad is BECAUSE this game has too many rage inducing moments and the

757	0	a	I would recommend you don't start playing this game in the first place. It has so many issues that never get resolved. They release the same thing over and over. Unfortunately I made the mistake and started playing it 3 years ago, now I am hooked. It's like an abusive relationship, you get tired of it and leave for a little bit, but end up coming back for more.
758	0	a	Pay to Win, all the highest skilled players buy guns, gear, and cosmetics with real money to get an edge against F2P players. Spawnkilling and Camping is rampent, community chatbox is complete cancer, giving you an experience reminicient of Youtube Comments instead of a real multiplayer experience. Teamwork is required but doesn't exist with most players. Playing alone outside of missions actually gets you more money than in missions with less risk of meeting a P2W player.  Enforcers overpopulate most servers and have an edge on players.  Server-end Latency results in it feeling like it takes forever to kill players, shooting them dozens of times to kill them. But of course if you purchase a gun from the 'armas marketplace' you instantly play better at the game.  While the characters are interesting and fun looking, the ultimate result in this game is disappointing, and the combination of cancerous P2W methods, spawncamping, hackers, outdated graphics, and repetitive gameplay make this ultimately an old attempt at making a free to play GTA game, and you will have better luck just going and playing GTA5.  For Character customization, go to any current-era MMO game and you will be able to find similar if not better.  This game isn't worth the time nor the effort.
759	0	a	This game has it's fair share of issues... It's one of those 'Pay to Win' games with korean style web-browser RMT-shop. Hackers run rampant and even if you manage to play with legit players, you will be (Seriously, you WILL be. Matchmaking sucks due to low player population and crappy code) decimated by them because they are far more experienced and better geared than you. Also, you will get against clans a lot, so prepare for that if you are ever going to give this game a shot. It's buggy, it feels cheap, missions get repetitive after a while and everything sucks.  Well, not everything. I enjoyed thoroughly the many customization options APB has. Sticking decals to yourself and to your car is more fun than it seems at first. You also could do even your own songs and 'themes' using an ingame music studio. But don't get too excited, you are not going to be able to explore all of it - some extremely useful features are locked behind a paywall.  Bottom line: Unless you are ready to pay for 'premium' - membership (Yeah, this game has a 'subscription', by subscribing, you can get your hands on more content which you cannot access as a normal player) and for some OP-weapons (Which can cost as much as 40 - 60â‚¬ and more EACH) , don't buy this game. In my opinion, there are better things (GAMES) to spend your money on.

Everything cost real money or just spent a very long amout of time to get it. There is very few different objectives and you will be doing the same thing over and over again. The game really isn't that good and is very boring. Just do yourself a favor and not play this or you might go brain dead...   So basically the game is poop
767	0	a	this game is like crack. I know its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but god damn do i keep coming back to it for some reason. if you have played over 300 hours then yea your good. if your new get out while you can. this game sucks so hard with the servers lagging you out nearly eery 5 minutes. seriously though gave me some great memories and freinds but jesus is it awful. the best part is the customization because it makes gta and saints row customization look like all you can do is simply change if you have a mustache or not.
768	0	a	Very few legit players left.  APB was one of the best games ever made. Sadly the company that purchased it Gamers First is one of the worst gaming companies out there. The issue with Gamers First is they have never had live anti cheat of any kind for APB. In turn this has allowed hackers to pretty much take over the game. During the past 2 years legit players have been leaving this game in masses due to the lack of working anti cheat. This game has been reduced to downloaded skills  I do not recommend this game for anyone that values legit gaming.
769	0	a	Filled with hackers and doesn't even have a functional way to report them, bad matchmaking, bad quality servers, bad hitreg, extremely repetitive. Miniscule community. I understand that it's free and all but dang this is bad even by f2p standards

775	0	a	This game have pay to win problems seriously this entire game is pay to win. I love the idea and customization to any vehicle but pay to win meaning pay to do this that anything you want permeantly pay to win. I will say pay to win alot due to the fact this game is mostly pay to win. Free players who didn't want to spend money weapons expire 10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing days about permeantly feature for us free players. This is very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t you gotta spend money on customization the game focuses on customization and weapons so limiting free players is like limiting the freedom from the united states. That is why this game gets a 3/10 its too pay to win. So if you like games like this play it but I don't recommend it to people who don't want to pay any money on video games like me. Expect CSGO get that knife and sell it. The game needs more work into the free aspect not the players who pay.

783	0	a	This game is a pretty standard example of how to milk a game for all it is worth using already existing assets.  I was an original player from back when the game was owned and run by Real Time Worlds (R.I.P) and published by EA. I was one of the first batch of players to play APB Reloaded during the closed beta period. After open beta is began it's continuous downward spiral.  Pros - Customization, it's nearly unmatched in the options for customizations  Cons - Poor community and lack of in-game moderating; griefers, hackers and inappropriate behavior that isn't punished. - Dominated by in-game microtransaction system; you'll rarely find people that play consistently who don't spend money in some form. It's not impossible to play without paying, takes a noticeable amount of time for it to be worth it. - Unoptimized. - Poor matchmaking; back during closed beta there weren't districts that were divided by 'threat level', so often times higher ranked players would get matched against many more people than were in their group. I consider that a step up to what is currently in the game. - Poor spawn system; pretty easy to push on a spawn so the enemy spawns farther away, and car spawners have completely ruined the dynamic of the game.
784	0	a	APB: All Points Bulletin, was my first encounter with this game back in 2010. I first heard about it in 2009 on a podcast I used to listen to weekly and they talked about this game for a little while, what I got out of it was that it was nothing more than a GTA clone with bad car mechanics and ok'ish graphics. So naturarly I didn't give it a second thought until one of my friends who had just gone trough GTA4 and its DLCs on PC started to talk about it just weeks before release and wanted me to join in and get it, I thought why not as the idea behind the game was cool... Well, the idea was cool but the execution was horrible, poorly optimized, lag spikes and a bunch of glitches. I lived trough this mess for around 56 hours of gametime before I quit, then just a couple months later it was announced that the developer and the game itself would close down. Wow, it had not been out for a year even, and they where already closing it down. Though as I can remember so had it cost a stupid amount of money to develop, so I kinda see why. Then a little while later somebody bought the IP and announced that it was going f2p.  Anyways, fast forward to summer of 2011 when the open beta for APB: Reloaded started and I tested it again, this time the game actually played nice, though still not the best when it comes to optimization and server stability but I cranked out around 100 hours before I quit again. Then I tested it again just a few months ago and it was still the same, nothing had changed. Nothing.   Pros
785	0	a	Cancer   Nah but foreels tho  This game is for a breed of serious gamers i will never fully understand, My best friend plays the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of this game. He admits its not the best game but he is so invested in it he cant stop playing #addictions
786	0	a	The character customization was absolutely beyond anything I have ever seen in a game and the graphics are decent. Yes. that's pretty much the only good I see in this game. I can trick out my character and car for hours on end, making it stand out from the rest; but what good is that if the game is unplayable 80% of the time? You're probably asking yourself, 'What does that mean?' Well this         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  APB Reloaded in a nutshell&nbsp;
787	0	a	Hackers, Server lag and much more has spoilt this once marvellous game. Don't just take my word for it, even other veterans with over 1000 hours will tell you the same.
788	0	a	This game is worse than â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cancer...
789	0	a	Boring, Shooting Mechanics Barley work, Concept is awesome and needs to be recreated in other games, but you need a better engine, better company, and better gameplay. Words said, waiting for actions
790	0	a	Tried to play it but it wasn't the open world free to play game I expected, The maps were tiny and there were set things to do on each map which I didn't like, also it kept telling me to kill people with bounties but never told me where they were. All I really did was die and then got bored.
791	0	a	First time login, having problem with register!  the UI sucks, how can i click that 'join now!' button if it's blocked by your ads???  Yes there is website, but this issue should be fixed for player's convenience
792	0	a	The game itself is GOOD. But if you don't have the time to grow a thick skin and overcome a steep learning curve, you will not enjoy it, and you should likely not bother.  I'm NOT recommending this game until some major change will transform the game into something better. I would love so much to do it, but I don't feel like I should right now.  Update from Nov 18th 2015 - meh, still not that much of an improvement. Still a harsh game to learn, still requires to be thick-skinned. If you don't take it seriously you can still have fun, though.
793	0	a	Pretty bad game, gets really repetitive and boring, the shooting is kind of off... But it has great customization. Must put a lot of money or a ton of time into the game to really get something out of it. Used to be a great game... used to....
794	0	a	I personally would not recommend the game. This is because of the fact that the matchmaking system sucks since a lot of the veteran players like going up against new players since it's easy. Also the fact that people do hack and the devs seem to not care.
795	0	a	this game got annoying just to download.some stuff i dont get why we need it.plus when i played it it got boring so fast
796	0	a	Worst 'free to play' game ever. Dont you even try playing this piece of poop. It will suck all your money.
797	0	a	best loading simulater ever. -900000000000000/10 would not recomend
798	0	a	One of, if not, the most unbalanced POS I've ever played 1/10.  Would not recommend. Not even worth writing a full review about.
799	0	a	Pay to win.   I mean, nothing more to say. All 'New' players are re-rolls, and are hardcores so they know everything about everything, and make sure that true 'new players' know that they are far more apt to everything the game has to offer.  This being said, I played this long before it was a steam thing, and used to be very good at it as well, but it lost its glory when it became pay to win.   3/10 - 'I'm a noob and know it' Simulator

801	0	a	This game is so pay2win u wouldn't believe it which is very sad considering the awesome customization options and decent gun-play.I really wanted to like this game but the lack of PvE means you will get your butt handed to you almost every mission you play, because of someone that spent like 100$ on this cash grab.It can be fun when playing with friends sometimes but that happens very rarely. Stay AWAY from APB Reloaded, you are better off playing Warframe,Defiance or Firefall.

803	0	a	I can safely say, that this is one of the games that fall into the horrible 'pay to win' category. The player that pays for advanced weapons and equipment put you at a disadvantage. However, it is still possible to kill them if you know what you're doing and you work well with your team mates. If you're a casual fps player, I'd look at another game, unless you're able to learn from getting killed over and over by pay to win players. If you have some skill at fps games, this should be no problem.  Putting the whole 'pay to win' discussion aside, this is just a mediocre game at best. Everything is rather reptitive. If you're a criminal, you steal items for money or fight enforcers. If you're an enforcer you can catch criminals in the act and/or fight them. It's rather boring. The map is horribly small; you'll have seen and explored everything on your first play through. Therefore, you're losing out on the whole 'discovery' aspect of many successful games.  This games works in two parts. There is the explorable mode and the mission mode. While not on any missions you are unable to fight anyone. While you're in a mission, you can't kill anyone else but your targets. There are two issues with this: 1) If you come online and want to join your friend in a mission, you can't. You are unable to help kill their opposition. 2) If you're in a mission, a person outside the mission can thwart you by ramming your car, blocking your path, and being the eyes of the enemy team. You are unable to kill them. They are a ghost.  If you're going to play game as a solo player, just don't. You'll be so bored, so fast. You'll become frustrated easily from losing over and over. Players in this game are rather bad, so expect your team mates to play horribly. However, if you're going to play with friends, this game will give you some entertainment value.  This game gets a 2/10 for being some what fun if you play with friends. Regardless, this game is not worth picking up.

811	0	a	This game have pay to win problems seriously this entire game is pay to win. I love the idea and customization to any vehicle but pay to win meaning pay to do this that anything you want permeantly pay to win. I will say pay to win alot due to the fact this game is mostly pay to win. Free players who didn't want to spend money weapons expire 10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing days about permeantly feature for us free players. This is very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t you gotta spend money on customization the game focuses on customization and weapons so limiting free players is like limiting the freedom from the united states. That is why this game gets a 3/10 its too pay to win. So if you like games like this play it but I don't recommend it to people who don't want to pay any money on video games like me. Expect CSGO get that knife and sell it. The game needs more work into the free aspect not the players who pay.
812	0	a	Hmmm What can i say about APB Reloaded... Well The game is great if there wasent so much hacking lag and general No â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Given when it comes to the developers.... They just dont care about the people or game... This game is only for and ever will be for people who pay to win .... Hackers who ptw will Never get banned becuase unless uve payed more then him or have more people who ptw report him nothing will get done.. Free to play people have no pull in the game...Its terrible some of the ptw weapons being super op.. Its just an unfit game for anyone who doesnt want to spent 50+ dollars to win and troll people  2/10 f%*king Disgracefull  Gamers first my â™¥â™¥â™¥ more like Bank account First   UPDATE: 4/10/14  Well im done with this game 150+ hours and im a decent player but its just too terrible, Ive incounterd so many hackers and Such op weapons this game isnt fun anymore Those of you who ever play F.ree T.o P.lay games Please check if its by Gamers First.  Games go to Gamers First to die slowly  Just dont play any games by these people do yourself a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Favor and Dont get frustrated

815	0	a	Can't even verify my email from my mail account to log into my gamersfirst account which i need to connect to my steam account for some reason.   Too many accounts - 0,0/10 IGN
816	0	a	i played to mutch of this game and i started to hate it after i found out that it was not that i sucked it was the shooting system the game has no head shots or weak points. that showed the reality for pay to win the more you pay for guns with real money the better you are in combat. it's impossible to get good guns for free. and if you get something remotely close to good you are limited to few weeks to own it. you can get free guns that last forever but to get one gun you need to play this for more than 40h and they will still suck (obs. if you see someone with fancy car or cool clothing that you need to fight, you better run). then we are done with guns, now we can go to customization the main thing that the game rubs in your face. Yea it's good but for non members you are limited to specific number of layers on eatch object. the music maker system is pointles couse most music that you can find from community is copies of edm and the samples you get to use sounds like form sega genesis (michael jackson's moon walker Was better than this). the cars just looks like chinese knock off of american and japanese cars. only the little plus isbattle arena wich is bit addictive but will make you angry after finding out the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wepon system i can't give a good score to this game couse of bad shooting system, good but limited customsation, pay to win system and badly made car models. i give 2/10 (better to download gta sa. with online mod or get gta 5)

819	0	a	  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this pay2win game!!!!!!!
820	0	a	Gosh, this game is completely f*cked up! Matchmaking is utterly bulls*it. From the very beginning you need to play with highlevel characters and donaters. Donate, f*ck, it's terrible. It's not just 'pay to buy something faster than the others' it's completely 10000% Pay2Kicka*s. Customization in this game is just wonderful. It is the one reason why you should play this game, else DON'T EVEN TRY IT.  AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.
821	0	a	I would recommend you don't start playing this game in the first place. It has so many issues that never get resolved. They release the same thing over and over. Unfortunately I made the mistake and started playing it 3 years ago, now I am hooked. It's like an abusive relationship, you get tired of it and leave for a little bit, but end up coming back for more.
822	0	a	Here is what I think. APB Reloaded is a good Game, but I feel that I should both critisize and nit pick a lotta things about this game  One is the SMG charging and the repeditiveness to lose to another player because of the overpower of the SMG's in the game. It is so god awful and OP, It made me stop playing this all together. People would just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sprint at you, boomboom â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. They do it with shotguns even. It's stupid as all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, also, the new Argotech ACES R&amp;D III is the most OP weapon in the game, and the most unfair, it directly hits, no need for anything else, no range no nothing. People running around with OSMAW Bazookas and silly Argotech ACES SMGs are cowards and are idiots for buying something for a cheap kill every five seconds.   Two is the Customization, specifically for males. I generally have a Randy Savage-Esque Character, but I want more than a Randy Savage look. I want to see hair that will SURPASS my shoulder/neck. I want to see long where is surpasses the shoulders to even the top half of the Pectoral. I really do not care what the general style of man is, give us that choice please. I have a problem with games that never seem to give a choice about Hair style for men, and just give the more mainstream stylings and as I repeat, absolutely sick of it. I want to see a helluvalot more.  Three is the Car handling, which is GOD AWFUL. Simple, It's so unecessarily hard. Go around a corner, you hit a brick â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing wall in 12 seconds and then your dead.   Four... The â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing unbalancing of the 'threat levels'. Bronzies all in one, but goldies and silvers mixed together... this game is way under balanced and stupid. it just is horrifingly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I kept on getting my â™¥â™¥â™¥ handed to me because of the Goldies 'better skills' and there silly pay 2 win cheapo weaponry. This game HEAVILY relies on you having to buy weapons all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time and having them rented out instead of kept which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dumb. You basically are vulnerable as a cop or a criminal. Oh but the Enforcers (cops) have all the advantages of quickly getitng everything. Yeah. The Goods It's Free, so if you are looking for a filler game, go ahead, get this It has the Best customization, despite what I say about Male customization. Sometimes, you can win by using simple weaponry and stuff. SOme of the Pay 2 Win items are pretty good if you think about it. Most importantly, it is a co-opish game, so you can play with friends  Overall, If I were to rate tis on a simpler basis, it would be atleast a 5/10 Because of the new crap that G1 and Reloaded added.   Thanks Reloaded, you guys do not know anything about fairness.  Edit: I am putting on the thumbs down, but it's your choice. at this point I am in the middle. ANd the reason there is so much bad is BECAUSE this game has too many rage inducing moments and the

831	0	a	I have played this game for little over a year now, with over 660 hours played and over Â£200 spend on ingame-items.   The game is fun when you first start. It is much like GTA but with factions added in. The gameplay can be very broken at times, and the server performance is very poor for EU servers. US servers are much better due to them having their hardware upgraded, so if you can, play on Joker (NA EAST) as it is the most stable server.   The community that resides around this game is like non-other. They will complain about anything and everything, but with good reason. It is only recently, that the game has made any progress in terms of quality of game-play, as the anti-cheat software was updated. The game went from using the free version of Punk Buster, to using Fair-fight, which saw a mass ban of cheaters for a short while. Due to the nature of this game, most cheaters will just create a new account and carry on the way they were. Major content updates are very rare, most updates are re-skinned guns, or clothing/car packs. Many features that we have been promised, such as a kill counter for events, are still yet to show their faces.  The support that is offered for transactions and other issues is not useful at all. It is dealt with by only 2-3 people, who will give you the same automated answer, even if it is not relevant to the ticket that you have made. The rest of the staff that you will com across throughout the game are all generally very pleasant people and good at what they do. Some of them are not so good, and often do controversial things which caused drama within the community, the latest of which is about many of the top tier NA players being accused of hacking and banned hacking, or trash talking on the in-game VOIP software (Trash talking on VOIP is encouraged by in-game tips on loading screens).  In conclusion, if you want a semi-broken game to play with friends and dont have money to buy GTA, play this, but DO NOT spend any money on the game, otherwise you will end up like me (Â£200 out of pocket).

833	0	a	I have played this god forsaken for hours, hours, ive spent an ungodly amount of money on this game. Because that is practically the only way to do good in this game. The community of this game is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ full of awful people. If you are actually good at third person shooters then do not get this game. You will constantly be called a hacker. You will eventually get banned just as i have, and in return lose everything youve worked for. I was max rank with everything unlocked and i payed the price for being accused a hacker. I know sit at home staring at my screen wishing that i could punch the C.E.O of Gamersfirst in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing face. This Game's Community, and EVERYTHING it stands for is absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!

838	0	a	This game is a mess. Tried to like it so I could play with friends, but just...it isn't fun. Spawnkilling is commonplace, and the community is toxic. It drove me away too fast and the game seems awful to me. I wouldn't recommend this until Reloaded Games gets their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in line and fixes this game.
839	0	a	Unfortunately, while this game is unique in that you unlock clothes and character customizations as you play, you have to deal with trolls and hackers (which unfortunately the game devs vehemently deny, because of their 'hackguard software' is good... Like 6 years ago..) Some days the trolling can be so bad, that when I do play anymore, I am usually sitting on roofs sniping NPC characters with a handgun or using the van that I eventually unlocked to smash storefronts to rob them.. Missions are only really enjoyable if you have friends playing with you that can calm you down when you end up queued against a team of max rank gold players whom are only on your server to troll because they claim to not be able to fill their own gold server (which they have and have had for several years) but in actuallity prefer trolling people that they know that they can beat (Less experienced players), rather than fighting people of their own calibur. Weapons are another can of worms all together. Permanent box weapons, which can cost you an arm and a leg, can turn an unskilled player into god with no effort whatsoever, even the rank unlocked guns and cars are junk next to the purple and gold weapons and cars in the G1 and Joker stores. On a side note, I do have a few permanent weapons and cars, from owning the retail version of the game, but even those are inadequate to the newer stuff that comes out every few months. At least my retail cars have mobile supply to let me change out gear in the middle of town.  Still it is much funner to ride around town shooting NPC, mugging, storefront robbery and grand theft auto, then playing the missions with unfair ranking. Money can even be made if you learn how to manipulate the Music Maker and clothes designers and sell what you make on the players market. I used to make money nearly everyday selling death tunes in the tune of Nyan Cat and Still Alive. The company claims to have unfair ranking and hacking under control, but this cannot always be seen when playing.
840	0	a	DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME IN DOWNLOADING THIS GAME IT IS FULL OF HACKERS AND THE DEVS DON'T CARE!!!!  It has so much potential to be a great game, but unless you're hacking, don't waste your time!! You can purchase the hacks online, those are the ones that the Devs don't do anything about, do not download a free hack or it will be picked up!! Why am I telling which hacks work? Because I want this game to go down and be destroyed along with all the hacker â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and useless devs. If you make a game, get rid of hackers or land up being a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ title that is overrun by a small population of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s and loses out on a possibly very supportive fan base.
841	0	a	Personal Rating: 3/10  What's there to say about this game? It's not fun. To be honest I don't know how I sunk over an hour of my life into this catastrophe of a game. In essence, it's a GTA clone. When entering the game it turns into a Saints Row clone. Two remarkable games, should be easy to copy, right? Wrong. The controls, awful and clunky, especially in vehicles. What's the point of the game you ask? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if I know, there isn't one by the looks of things. You get plonked into a game and told to do, something...  It isn't established. There isn't a plot point, your character has no name, no tutorial, no nothing. If this game weren't free then I'd steer clear of it. But even then, it's free, so don't download it. Save yourself the time and go play some of the variables. Maybe buy a GameCube and play True Crime?
842	0	a	Greetings,  Here we find the explanation of development and how it's supposed to and not-to work. Here we see a great concept, but the game's amongst one of the poorest methods of executions. It's been floating around for about 6-years, it's dissapeared and re-appeared, regardless; not much has changed on it. It's free-to-play, so if you wish to give it a try, go ahead. It's a fun game with friends, sadly it looks too much like a money-grabbin' development team but no clue do I have. Either way, recently as of 2016 mentions of new directions &amp; paths for this game to embark have been set, but this promise has been made many times (2011-2016) through many formerly responsible people of APB's development, administration &amp; moderation team. But let's hope it takes the right way into further growth.  Kindest regards, Nick.

852	0	a	Gameplay is pretty linear and there is more fun to be held in customising than actual combat, which is mostly dominated by hackers which dont seem to get banned.
853	0	a	the game is bad optimized my computer nearly exploded NOW I HAVE 8GB RAM THIS IS WORST GAME ON STEAM EVER
854	0	a	Do Not Play!!!! Still Full Of Hackers!! and it looks like Gamers First don't give 2 sh**'s!! !!!!!!!People Need To Stop Giving Them Money!!!!!!!
855	0	a	This game is for the lowest class trash you grew up with. You know the kid down the street who had a rich dad and owned every GTA game? Yeah that guy now plays this game. He was a piece of trash then and he's a piece of trash now.. This game is pay to win. That is not debatable. Stole it's character creator from EVE Online. 0/10
856	0	a	Very bad experience wth this game: Launching this game messes up the whole steam client. Even after i close the game steam still shows it running in my status and everything else, now one would think as to restart the client to fix this but steam does not exit when a game is running, so it keeps requesting me to close the game first before exiting while it is already closed!(Also,you cannot launch the game again as it is already running according to steam)...sticky situation xD. then i have to use the task manager to manually terminate all steam processes and start steam again. Pretty tedious right? and this was just a single issue out of the many this game brings to the system. I could write about more issues but it would make this review too long, so in conclusion: very bad personal experince=would not recommend to anyone.
857	0	a	Falsely banned over 3 years ago. Terrible customer service as you can't even email them to contest the ban. Didn't respond to my BBB inquiry.   Had the nerve to tell me that I was justly banned but the need my money now so they are unbanning me. They can shove this game where the sun doesn't shine.
858	0	a	i was a noob once, then i bought the keys to the city and never lost a mission ever again its extremely hard to play as a new player and by new i mean anything below max level i just play it for the character customization, thats pretty well done in this game this is now a dress up game for me though thats only if i can get the game to work correctly  let me refer-a-friend you and will carry the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of you

860	0	a	The idea of this game is really good, but the problem is that the developers are greedy and they are liars. Promised engine update in the begining of 2014 and it's now the end of 2015 and still no update. Instead they push out useless guns that are only reskins of FREE weapons (except legendary weapons) and they are concentrated on pushing even more of that stuff. The old players lost hope for this game and this game is dying slow since the devs don't want to actually do something about the outdated graphics and the game engine. The servers are sometimes laggy (atleast for me I think) and the community is the worst. If you win a mission and you do good you get spammed with private messages about you being a hacker.  But there are some good things also. There are almost no limitations in customizing your character, vehicles, clothes. You can create you own music and 5 second themes which are played to the person after you killed him in a mission.  I hope the devs fix this game and stop the useless or sometimes extremely overpowered weapon flood in the ARMAS marketplace.   I wouldn't recommend this game because it has too much flaws because the devs ruined the game and the game is not fun anymore. Would recommend GTA 5 instead of this game although it lacks customization elements.  I hope my review helped.
861	0	a	The community of this game is absolutely horrible. The gunplay is some of the worst I have seen. It is extremely pay to win and it should be redlighted from steam in my honest oppinion.

865	0	a	So, where to begin with this game.  The gameplay is good, that's all i'll say about that. What's wrong with this game?  - The Community  - Pay2Win  - The constant fps drop every minute or two  This has to be the worst online community i've ever seen. If you want to play with a bunch of spoiled kids who insult you because you didn't have your 'mommy' buy you in game skins and overpriced/powered weapons and don't play good when you've just started and go into a level matched mode, have fun.  Everything else, yeah, you already know. No need for me to explain.

868	0	a	Nice to see it's still broken as hell after 2 years.
869	0	a	Nice idea totally broken by a horrible matchmaking, which ends making matches between fresh new players that are learning how to play with endgame players (makes totally no sense). Also, as usual in every 'Free To Play Games' theres a 'Pay To Win Option' that makes you premium and get the good weapons to win all matches easily.  Most weapons AREN'T permanent, they last around 10 days max. The game constantly lag's out, and bugs are frequent. Specially when you're shooting.  The protection against hackers is horrible, as I have seen people using Pistols from long range like if they were using a sniper (reminding that theres not a zoom option, or a very very poor one), I've also seen people using Heavy Rifles with the accuracy of a sniper, which is highly improbable.  Do not recommend, waste your time elsewhere :)    
870	0	a	Wow, ok. So apparently they made this free to play. So, long ago I had actually BOUGHT this game and up until about 2014 I had it in my steam library, because it was a purchase. Well, I go to play some today (2016) and find that it was removed from my account, either because they 're-released' it, or because they voided my purchase. Anyway, I go to download it and notice that it isn't 'free to play' but actually 'free to pay' NINETY-NINE F'ING DOLLARS FOR DLC?! THIRTY DOLLARS? The developers also don't know how to do DLC because they have the same DLC pack for both $29 and...free....So, let me see, you delete the game (which I paid for), didn't issue me a refund, and now expect people to pay $139 for your DLC which adds basic game functionality to it? Oh, yeah, they also have a habit of deleting your accounts due to 'database malfunctions'. (see 2011) HA! No way I would recomend this. This was a dead game back in 2011 and now, under the tyranical control of the new 'developers' (must be french for check cashers), has become not only a joke but a steaming pile of feces.
871	0	a	Like every 'Free to Play' Game out there, today. You get a bunch of fedora sporting, neckbearded fat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s and spoiled kids spending their mommy's money or their benefits checks on overpowered â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for their characters. Just as soon as you start playing, you're constantly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in every direction by unbalanced weapons and rockets and all you get is a two inch â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a weapon that does nothing. The cars control like you're on ice, even when those cars look like they're your typical front-wheel drive rice burner from Fast and the Furious or an All Wheel Drive supercar. If you want a game that you can play for free, don't waste your time and save your money on a better game. Seeing games like this is no wonder that they get bombarded by hackers and trainers.
872	0	a	I have played this game for 287 hours and honestly was one of the worst experiences i have had in gaming. From the ridiulous leveling system, to the quite frankly pay to win aspect of the entire game, i would honestly NEVER recommend this game to anyone.  The community can be extremely toxic and vulgar, with casual swearing and slurs in chat, just a small anoyance, but nevertheless.  The only good thing that this game has to it is playing with friends. The only possible way to beat the NUMBER of broken guns is by using a 3-4 person group on a single person. This might sound absurd, but unfortunately, this imbalance does exist.  The only reason why i have this amount of hours on the game is playing with friends, and the addiction that this game shoves down your throat, along with the 'you must pay to play this game evenly against your opponents' attitude.  Dissapointing that trash like this exists on steam.  EDIT: Grammar stuffs
873	0	a	Usually I don't downvote on a game concept like this, but the gameplay APB:Reloaded offers is completely awful. Gunplay is terrible, you need to spend real money in order to keep the weapon forever, players equipped with a pistol can kill you in 2 shots, but it takes 20-30 shots to kill them with an assault rifle, (this is close combat), overall for gunplay...it's just...clunky and static. Servers always lag. Most players stay in the 'Social District'. There is matchmaking but you can choose either to go into a Matchmaking PVP District, or No-Matchmaking PVP District. Surprisingly, rarely anyone plays in the Matchmaking PVP Version of a District. Driving a car is like driving a stick of butter, or driving a brick. You can customize cars and clothes as much as you want. Clothes in the market, created by other players will usually cost a lot of in-game money, around 100k when each mission you play against other players, will only give you 500 in-game money or lower. Completely it's a pay-to-look cool/win, mixed with bad game mechanics.   I like the game concept, but the ways done in the game...are just laggy and boring after a while.

It's a great example of what to avoid, it isn't a terrible game...that being said I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend I wouldn't want to put them towards the toxicity this game's community offers on a daily basis or the frustrations that would be had with this game. Devs are still behind their promised much needed engine re-work and the community is shrinking more and more each week.

887	0	a	I love the customization and everything. The only problem is, the community is more toxic than a nuclear meltdown site, the game is clawing at your wallet 24/7, and the fighting is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Honestly, I would play it from time to time, in between 10 hour sessions of TF2 or whatever, but...well...here's the thing. I once logged on to APB, wanting to just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around for an hour or whatever. I get the infinite loading screen glitch, and I haven't been able to play since. Yes, I've gotten free stuff for waiting...BUT I CAN'T ENJOY THE FREE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING STUFF WHEN I CAN'T GET INTO A DAMN SERVER! I found there is one way to bypass this, and it's by creating a new character from scratch. Every. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing. Time. I. Want. To. Play.   I really want to like this game, I really do. But I'm not gonna spent one â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cent until you fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
888	0	a	Unfortunately I'm going to have to say this with a heavy heart. I do not recommend APB Reloaded. I put a lot of hours into this game and while it can be irritating it is really fun; but here's the kicker: once you're leveled up enough you then deal with hackers. In order to continue to play and actually have any decent fun, you need to hack yourself. It sounded dumb and at first and I did not believe the person who told me so I kept playing. But over the next couple of days I realized he was right. Not only do the players hack but while I played all the servers were hacked as well and these actions made it almost unplayable. The idea is great and the gameplay is great; but all the constant hacking done do this game ruins the fun. If it weren't for the hackers I'd highly recommend this game.

893	0	a	Probably the worst MMO I've played. Actually, probably the worst game I've ever played, and I've played quite a few â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in my day. Let me explain.  First off, the only feature I loved about the game was character creation. So many options and the ability to adjust things to your liking without having to use presets, which I assumed a game like this would. (Judging by the graphics and how similar the characters look.) I spent around 25+/- minutes creating my character alone.   Now once I finished and chose my spawn location, I was pretty excited about getting into the game. Once I loaded, the first thing I noticed right off the bat was the graphics were less pleasing to the eye than they were during character creation. Checked my graphics settings and they were the same as they were before, so I'm not sure what that was all about. Changing them to a lower one and then back didn't solve the problem either.   You're immediately given tutorial quests which basically give you the run down on controls and game basics, but I was shot and killed before I could even finish the second list. Apparently you have the option of being or not being ready, and your decision effects whether or not another player (real person, not npc) can come and shoot you, bash into your car, or any other way to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you and your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up. I'm not sure when I became ready, was probably just an accidental setting I did while being a derp with the keyboard commands, but I wish that would have been earlier in the tutorial lists so that I would know 'Hey don't go outside while you're ready or some random will see your noob â™¥â™¥â™¥ and kill you on sight.'   I was then asked to hijack a car and drive 500m. First, I had to hit the F key 3 times before my character would even consider the possibility of taking a car, and it took me a few times to finally hijack one because by the time I hit the F key enough times, the vehicle was driving off and my character was just standing there in the middle of the road being the prissy little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ she's been since the start. Once I finally got a car, I tried to drive it per the 500m quest goal, and I have got to tell you. It's like learning how to drive all over again. You go left, the game decides to go left 3 seconds later. Oh, you want to straighten out your car so you're not ramming into pedestrians on the street? Okay, just hit the arrow key once to go the other direction and we'll just ram you into on-coming traffic because what is smooth movement, am I right? I was zig-zaging down the road until the quest was finished, then immediately got out of the car and ran far away from it never to drive again.  Trying not to give up on the game just yet, I started running around to see if I could find other players who hopefully wouldn't try to gun me down at first glance, but was set in 'not ready' just in case. Mind you, I was pretty much naked because somehow from the start to the car ride, I lost my clothes and I never tried to figure out how to get them back. /secretly calls out YOLO/ After running for about 5 minutes, I finally found another player at a vehicle spawn machine thingy and tried to communicate with him using the chat. After waiting a minute for a response, he turns around, sees me, tries to shoot, realizes I can't be killed, then hops into his mini-van and drives off towards the sunset unscaved--while all I was trying to do was make a friend who knew how to play the game.  All in all, this game gets a whole whopping 0.1/5 from me. While I know there are fans who love it, which is perfectly fine, I can't find myself playing this any more, which is what I usually force myself to do when I'm really trying to find the good parts of a game, but first impressions go along way with me and this game makes Nexon's look golden.   I'd rather play GTA Online with all the f-ckery that goes on there than deal with this game. At least it's optimized better, has better graphics and playstyle, and doesn't make you feel like you're playing GTA 3's crackhead cousin of a game.  Last but not least, this game is practically p2w, with premium members getting a 30%~ bonus of cash and experience from missions and people who are willing to pay for weapons and such get all the good stuff from their cash shop. The store page should say 'Free to download, but must pay to get anywhere in the game without wanting to rip your hair out with the normal sluggish process,' not free to play.

897	0	a	Don't mind the Steam played time. I played it when RTW owned it, and I've got 188 hours in the G1 version.  Let me break this down for you.  The game advertises customizing your guns to fit your playstyle. Unfortunately, to do that, you will need to grind. A lot. First you have to grind contacts to unlock that gun, then you have to grind kills to get upgrades for that gun (that may not even be the upgrade type you want).  And the grinding will NOT be fun. The playerbase is all but gone, which means matchmaking (not that it was EVER good) is horrible. Expect to be stomped on constantly by the folks who have spent plenty of cash for the much more effective ARMAS weapons. Also expect to be matched up against gold players as a bronze or silver a lot. They hang out in the bronze districts because there's nobody to be found in silver or gold.  So if you like being forced to open the ARMAS store every time you open the game (unless you turn off Steam in-game), having UPGRADE NOW flash at you every time you finish a mission, and having to get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ stomped on for hours upon hours because there's literally nobody else to play against, this game is for you.  If you don't like lessons in masochism, do not play this game. I tried. I really tried to enjoy the game, but I just couldn't... and I fear you might not either.  Unless you drop a couple hundred dollars and start mowing people down. Then you might like it.  EDIT: Lest I forget there IS a way to get the cash shop guns by grinding tons of in-game cash and daily limited Joker tickets. So if you're a masochist, this game is for you.
898	0	a	This game is miserable.   The gameplay itself is decent, playing as a poor man's GTA Online (years before GTA had online). The customization is second to none. The amount of options you have for clothing, tattoos, decals, car paintjobs, and spray tags are limited only by your imagination (and subscriber level). If this was simply a graphic design sim, it would be the best around.  Unfortunately, it is an online shooter. It is in this aspect that the game fails horribly. The matchmaking is either insane or non-existant. The game ranks your skill in four levels: green, bronze, silver, and gold. You will come out of the tutorial as a bronze or silver, and be immediatly pitted against gold players that are maxed on rank. You will look at your own team and see another bronze, two silver, and an enemy team of five gold players. Now, the fact that they are max rank does not confer any actual bonuses on them (aside from weapon mods to slot into their weapons), but it does show a blatant lack of balancing.  This game is also infested with lag. All those customization options from earlier? It takes awhile for all of those to load in when the action gets hot and heavy. Expect frequent pop-up while driving, and cars that will seemingly continue to drive themselves after you hit the brakes. Ending the game does not end the lag either. About 25-50% of the time you exit the game, it will continue to run the process in the background. Meaning to fully close the game, you will have to ctrl+alt+del and kill the process manually. This game lags so badly, it can even lag you out when you are not in-game anymore.  The weapon purchasing system is a bit of a pain as well. You start with a generic assault rifle and pistol, and need to lease any other guns you wish to use. This gun will be available for the next nine days, after which point you will need to re-lease it again. If you do not feel like grinding through the ranks, you can spend cash in the shop to lease unlocked guns, as well as some guns that have mods that are not available with game currency. This leads to pay2win guns that are simply better than the guns you can unlock through playtime with game cash. It is important to note that even the real cash guns are not bought, they are returned at the end of the lease and must be purchased again with more real life money.  The community is a mixed bag. You have ultra-creative people selling outfits, tattoos, cars, and paint jobs that look like professional designers made them. Then you have the usual toxic shooter crowd in the other districts. There will be lots of griefing, whispers of hackusations, and you will be sworn at in practically every language on Earth. It is very easy to fill your ignore list up in two weeks of play, leading to needing to delete past offenders off the list. Since the game is rated-M, there are no limits to what you can say or display on the boards. Expect to see â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, swastikas, and other unpleasant things sprayed on walls throughout the city. This game is truely a troll's paradise.  Pros: - character customization - vehicle customization - creative community  Cons: - matchmaking - performance - business model - toxic community

The only good thing that this game has to it is playing with friends. The only possible way to beat the NUMBER of broken guns is by using a 3-4 person group on a single person. This might sound absurd, but unfortunately, this imbalance does exist.  The only reason why i have this amount of hours on the game is playing with friends, and the addiction that this game shoves down your throat, along with the 'you must pay to play this game evenly against your opponents' attitude.  Dissapointing that trash like this exists on steam.  EDIT: Grammar stuffs
904	0	a	Usually I don't downvote on a game concept like this, but the gameplay APB:Reloaded offers is completely awful. Gunplay is terrible, you need to spend real money in order to keep the weapon forever, players equipped with a pistol can kill you in 2 shots, but it takes 20-30 shots to kill them with an assault rifle, (this is close combat), overall for gunplay...it's just...clunky and static. Servers always lag. Most players stay in the 'Social District'. There is matchmaking but you can choose either to go into a Matchmaking PVP District, or No-Matchmaking PVP District. Surprisingly, rarely anyone plays in the Matchmaking PVP Version of a District. Driving a car is like driving a stick of butter, or driving a brick. You can customize cars and clothes as much as you want. Clothes in the market, created by other players will usually cost a lot of in-game money, around 100k when each mission you play against other players, will only give you 500 in-game money or lower. Completely it's a pay-to-look cool/win, mixed with bad game mechanics.   I like the game concept, but the ways done in the game...are just laggy and boring after a while.
905	0	a	I'm not quite sure if some players are using hacks or they're just too pro as in too pro to know where we guys would come. lol
906	0	a	This game has a lot of potential but the amount of hackers and the pay to win system ruins it.
907	0	a	FULL OF HACKERS G1 PRETENDS IT ISNT DONT BELIEVE THEM
908	0	a	Laggy and bad. 2 thumbs down
909	0	a	APB Reloaded.  played it before. loved it nowdays its not a game i really like. it forces you to put money into it to be a more successful player in it. the optimization is crappy too. 
910	0	a	What used to be a great game with lots of potential was bought up by a new company whose devs were there for the money, not the game. Now it's a mere shadow of its former self, filled to the brim with hackers and toxic kids, as the devs recycle old assets to churn out the last couple dollars they can get. I'd stay away from this digital landfill of a game.
911	0	a	They put ban for no reason, and you can not do anything to get your account back.  The support team will never ansver on your qostions.  The game itself is good, but if you thinking to play it seriously after some time this game will disappointed you a lot.

915	0	a	Have only played this game for 4 hours. (Played for over 2000 in 2009-2011).  THUMBS DOWN - why?  #1 - Punkbuster - I just got an email saying a My PUNKBUSTER BAN has been lifted and i am being given a second chance to return to APB. WTF??? What Punkbuster ban?  #2 - Pay to win.  #3 - Empty world. MAYBE 30-40 people in a district when it used to be 200.  #4 - Did i say Punkbuster and Pay to Win?  #5 - Too much P.

917	0	a	When you first start out, it's kinda unfair, start a mission and boom, in the game with higher ranked players with basically OP weapons... People kill you in less than 3-4 hits.  How can this be fair to a new player? Now I wonder why it had mixed reviews.
918	0	a	Not cool.. Why? Never could play on that game and have fun on it... (sadly) Never could make a chracter I like will looks like.. Never works= always crashed..  Never like it Thought - its copy of GTA.. I not like it Saw the multi not liked it thogut ..  Annd my score is 3/10..

925	0	a	Pay to win, seriously. Also, matchmaking is trash.  In order to get matched against players you have a chance against, you constantly have to backwards-grind to lower your level.  You gotta pay money for good guns, good cars.  'Customization' my â™¥â™¥â™¥, you gotta pay for any good customization items too.

928	0	a	 A genuinely awful game.
929	0	a	Great customization (characters and vehicles) but it's also pay to win par excellence. You'll get owned by people with 'premium' guns permanently - I guarantee it. If you're not ready to pump money in this game then you maybe should look for an other game. It also seems like there are a hole bunch of cheaters playing, who (as I heard) won't even get banned because they buy stuff for real money. The game itself is really good but thanks to pay to win and the many cheaters it's not enjoyable for more than a month or so. Didn't touch it for years because of this.  Oh btw.: Most time I played back in the day I didn't play it over steam.

935	0	a	I have been playing this game on and off for about 5 years. Everytime I had to take a break from the game it was all because the hackers. -Speed hacks -Aim bots -Walls Much more...  Point is it's fun but the hackers have killed the game and made it suck balls.
936	0	a	Hate it, to many OP players, not suitable for beginners
937	0	a	This game has a very interesting concept and could have easily been one of the best games out there, but that's not really the case since the whole game bases a lot around paying real life money to get a severe edge over your opponents unless they have also paid with their money, and if that is not the case. You will usually always be matched up against people that are at a much higher rating than yourself which makes it pretty unfair considering all the advantages they have.  This game is pretty much stupid and unbalanced right now, wouldn't really recommand this game before they have removed the 'P2W' aspect of the game.
938	0	a	omg i hate the part that u need to like them on facebook!
939	0	a	its a pay to win
940	0	a	- Pay to Win - Matchmaking Unfair - VAC Suck - A lot of hackers - Never Update - Old Events
941	0	a	Fun for a while, but very pay to win and ruined by hackers. Punk buster was a hassle to even get working but now that that's gone it might be worth playing again.
942	0	a	Insanely grind or pay 2 win. Creators, you could make this game not free 2 play and remove that stupid premium â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and etc.. because not its imposible to play.. rich â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ are just chilling with premium stuff, when poor people get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ toxic and angry and everything, because they cant buy every gun they want for real money.
943	0	a	This game is awful, its full of cheaters and it lags terribly. Plus the Devs are pieces of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and its a p2w, so if you enjoy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games, cheaters, and having to pay for anything good in the game then you will love it. I wouldnt reccommend this game to anybody, literally anybody, not even my worst enemy.
944	0	a	This game only accomplishes one thing, customization. Everything else this game attempts to do is utter failure. Missions/Matches are greatly one sided, the gun play (The MAIN Point of a PVP Shooter) is copy and pace, repetitive, buggy, just flat out boring, driving is exactly what you would expect out of a F2P, â€œPoint A to point Bâ€¦ Yayâ€¦â€ and the game has a community worse than Halo and CoD!  All the time I spent in this game equaled to this.  70% Raging at a bad match because of how bad of a game this is. 25% Sitting in the social area AFK. 1% Having fun in a match. 3% Fun goofing around in the bland, small open areas (Its not even worth calling a sand box). 1% Enjoying the limited customization options for a non-monthly payment account.  This game is a perfect example of a horrible Pay2Win game being considered good by morons. Even being a Pay2Win, youâ€™ll still have to level up so slowly to the point where it makes Bad Company 2 level grinding look quick.  This game is even a better example than Call of Duty in showing how humans enjoy repetitive, copy and past, garbage.  The rating I give this game is a 2/10, not even worth looking at on the Steam Store. Its definitely not worth Recommending to anyone, unless you want them to check if Steamâ€™s Uninstall button is still working.

946	0	a	Loved this game at launch, but then the devs went bankrupt and the game shut down. Enter GamersFirst, who promised so much and delivered so little. I stopped playing in 2012. Hankering for an MMO and filled with fond memories, I reinstalled it yesterday and played just fine for an hour, then I get a Punkbuster kick for Disallowed Program/Driver. Not a clue what it could be related to because I can't find any log or anything even remotely helpful apart from an old stickied post in the APBR forums telling me to delete the pb folder in the game directory and reinstall pb etc... So, reluctantly, I do just that and now I get kicked every 3 minutes for packet flow. Solution to that? Uninstall pb and reinstall. Did I NOT just do this? So you know what? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it; I'm done.  Before I go though, let me tell you prospective players to just stay clear of this travesty; the core of the game is still fantastic, but the game as a whole is just muddled with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥te added by G1. What is essentially a CTF has it's own lobby, but it almost completely removes vehicles from the equation and the top dogs are the guys with the most OP weapons of the week, because G1 wants their money. If you're a Bronze or maybe even a Silver, you can enjoy access (or not, if it's full) to a lobby that actually is representative of what APB is. If you've hit Gold threat, then good luck finding anything but the aforementioned CTF.  If you don't have a top-tier, paid weapon, then prepare to get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on by anyone who does. The game has been this way ever since G1 got their grubby â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tained hands on APB, and I am sorry that I ever forgot about that. Also, Punkbuster has been a known issue for this game since 2012, help to sort this issue is not actually helpful, the 'known' fixes--if they work--only work for a few days at best before you have to repeat the whole 'fix', and... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it; I'm done.
947	0	a	How-to-beat-hackers simulator at its best.
948	0	a	11/10 would not recommend, game still is broken
949	0	a	I'm writing that I don't recommend this game because it isn't a type of game that everyone can enjoy. That being said, it you have a large wallet and are willing to shell out atleast $25 then you can consider it something you might enjoy. The game is almost 100% pay to win and being a member with all F2P weapons will almost guarantee that you will slit your wrists and die. Other than that, if you can get past the waves of hackers that go undetected with speed hacks, aimbot, and no recoil then all and all it's not an awful third person shooter.
950	0	a	This game is a bunch of bull crap. People with pay to play weapons, percs, tricked out vechiles ruining your day as you a wee low level try to get one perc. Hackers have kinda been dealt with but still some. Used to be a huge horde of hackers. Game can kinda get addicting if you manage to get atiny bit good or have high level clan mates to carry you. And 'DLC', Pay to win weapons, car decorations are stupidly expensive. Complete waste of your money.You could be spending it on better things. Would not recommend.
951	0	a	No real updates for years, mostly based on pay to win. Gets very repetitve, but a decent play at times. Community is mostly bad due to the fact that no one will show you any kind of mercy, but there area few friendly players who try help. I strongly recommend not spending any money on this game if playing at all.
952	0	a	Getting put into a game where someone the same level as me already has most of the higher-level stuff already unlocked #notpay2winatall  10/10
953	0	a	I dont recommend it. Pros= +Free gta clone +Nice Customization +Many Players Cons= -You cant change sens to very low -Toxic Community -Laggy -Hackers  
954	0	a	Anyone who pays is on top.
955	0	a	I love APB, but the game managers doesn't even care about their customers.
956	0	a	The Game where every second player are cheating...aimbot,wh.Play if you can...or can...
957	0	a	I downloaded this because the picture reminded me of Jet Grind Radio. The game didn't so I uninstalled it.
958	0	a	This game is terrible for beginers and horrible for solo play. if you can make friends and play it isnt so bad, but when they are off (and the game is dead so chances are they will not be on) the matchmaking litterally works to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you. G1, who hosts the game, cant give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the players, not even the PR Tiggs even plays the game on a regular basis. maybe when the engine update releases the game will be better. RIP APB:R
959	0	a	it is an alright sandbox game with what you would expect but it suffers from many of the usual free to play problems evrything is way to grindy some guns are just straight up better than others and in general the gunplay isnt fun i wouldnt reccomend this game unless you had some friends to play with for a little bit 
960	0	a	Just another p2w full of cheaters shooter... get away from this
961	0	a	This game has been trash since it was in beta before 'reloaded' don't waste your time.
962	0	a	I wish I had read the reviews before I actually went into the game a few years back. For the most part, you need a high end desktop to run this. I had found the concept interesting, but now it just runs rampant. The customization is really nice. However, this is NOT new user friendly (I'm an average player). I had no clue what I was doing. Everything seem expensive and confusing.
963	0	a	An okay game, I wouldnt recommend though. Alot of the servers are laggy, the community isnt the best, and quite frankly its really a pay to win kinda game. there are alot of other free to play games out there, and quite frankly id rather pay money for GTA or gmod (gamemodes) to play something like this.
964	0	a	To be perfectly frank, I can't think of one fun aspect in this game. There's barely any content, almost noone is online in my timezone(most likely caters to another country), and I could almost imedietly tell this is a pay-to-win.
965	0	a	Overall 5/10  keep in mind this may improve over time but as of now its not a good game. The base layer ishre for a great game, an open wrord Grand Theft Auto type climate. However soon after you start it bogs you down. The tutorial is terrible and while optional stays on screen till you complete it all(which is very hard. The biggest issues are the driving and shooting mechanices. They are terrible! The fun you have in this game goes away once combat starts. You often will die wihout seeing your enemy or become frustrated with how many imes yu have to hit your enemy for them to die. From far away they will simple run o cover. Up clsoeand the targeting system(or lack their of) and zoom make it exteremly difficult to kill someone. If your super sneaky you'll go far.  Again this could improve depending on changes
966	0	a	I bought this game when it was just APB with Realtime Worlds.  It was frustrating then but enough people played to make it mostly enjoyable. I decided to give it another go and I just can't even get a foothold.  It's an uphill battle the whole way. Max rank, gold threat opposition every single game. Me and the sad team the matchmaking system would scrounge up for me would get trounced every game without fail.  You either have to buy some better gear (which I get the sense they count on), find a team that's good or slog through the grind until you can compete.  Long story short, this game is NOT beginner friendly.  I also need to add that the 'microtransaction' system is nothing close to micro. In fact, to purchase a gun it costs $20 upwards. That's just a single gun. They've taken the notion of a free to play system and add ons that are cheap and gone crazy.  They incentivise it at every turn as well. It's an impossible grind to obtain items unless you buy them. In many games you almost have to have the purchased weapons in order to compete when the other team is packing them. I'm sure most people would rather just buy a game outright and have everything the game has to offer, or at the very least not pay a price for additional content that rivals what a normal game's price would be to begin with.  It's a shameful, obvious cash grab. I would buy something if the prices weren't so outrageous. This system has strangled and alienated the community at a steady rate. I'd be surprised if within 2 years this game is still alive as a result.  ...Not to imply that the current community population could be considered 'alive.'

970	0	a	Does't work so I can't recommend it.

972	0	a	2 hrs loading .. WTF!!!
973	0	a	the game wont even start up for me what a waste of my life trying for 1 hour to get this work -1/10
974	0	a	This game was pretty good I liked the intro to it and the theme was really good, but I didn't like the gory headless horseman event it was pointless and boring. I dowloaded this game because of the cars and fighting, I don't want to carve pumpkins or do any events, it does take time to unlock things on the game so be warned, you will have to have a lot of spare time on your hands. The fighting part and car driving is fun though and the customization options are very wide. It was really fun and enjoyable, although the events were boring.
975	0	a	Was fun in 2010-2012, wont be checking it out in 2015  Just say your goodbyes and go to Grand Theft Auto: Online
976	0	a	worst game ever remove this steam you only get wepons for 10 days free the rest you have to use real money with you lag like never before u cant play... so yea get it gone

979	0	a	cheaters, donat, server lags.  as gamers of apb sad: â€¢moneyfirst â€¢all points lag
980	0	a	Fairly depressing Has a lot of lag for the mode it's meant to be played in  Uninteresting visual style, art design, lack of variety. There are many other, better oprions if u want to play a mmo similar to this one 
981	0	a	It was good at first but the pay to win has become so extreme that you don't want to play after getting you're a â™¥â™¥â™¥ beat because u you don't want to put 10-100 bucks into a free to play. So I guess if you like a pay-TV - win cluster â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with cool customization that takes for ever to unlock... this is he game for you
982	0	a	If you are reading this review, then you probably haven't played the game yet.  Don't. Just don't.   You'll be put in against everybody with grenade launchers and LMGs while you're stuck with the worst guns possible. The Silver and Gold tiers of players are loaded with hackers, most of which gave up playing legit and got their hacks just to be able to compete with the other hackers, because that makes so much sense.

988	0	a	Honestly it's the best bad game I ever played. But in the end I'm sad I spent nearly 4 years playing it and almost 6 months of actual play time invested (that's 4k and a few hours) ( and no I don't login with steam often so it's less here.) that I will never get back, don't be fooled by the new paintjob it got with FF, FF is a s-hit anticheat and does nothing to save this game just move right along and play another game. Trust me it's not worth the time get good at a better or more important game.
989	0	a	I wish I had read the reviews before I actually went into the game a few years back. For the most part, you need a high end desktop to run this. I had found the concept interesting, but now it just runs rampant. The customization is really nice. However, this is NOT new user friendly (I'm an average player). I had no clue what I was doing. Everything seem expensive and confusing.

991	0	a	I bought this game when it was just APB with Realtime Worlds.  It was frustrating then but enough people played to make it mostly enjoyable. I decided to give it another go and I just can't even get a foothold.  It's an uphill battle the whole way. Max rank, gold threat opposition every single game. Me and the sad team the matchmaking system would scrounge up for me would get trounced every game without fail.  You either have to buy some better gear (which I get the sense they count on), find a team that's good or slog through the grind until you can compete.  Long story short, this game is NOT beginner friendly.  I also need to add that the 'microtransaction' system is nothing close to micro. In fact, to purchase a gun it costs $20 upwards. That's just a single gun. They've taken the notion of a free to play system and add ons that are cheap and gone crazy.  They incentivise it at every turn as well. It's an impossible grind to obtain items unless you buy them. In many games you almost have to have the purchased weapons in order to compete when the other team is packing them. I'm sure most people would rather just buy a game outright and have everything the game has to offer, or at the very least not pay a price for additional content that rivals what a normal game's price would be to begin with.  It's a shameful, obvious cash grab. I would buy something if the prices weren't so outrageous. This system has strangled and alienated the community at a steady rate. I'd be surprised if within 2 years this game is still alive as a result.  ...Not to imply that the current community population could be considered 'alive.'
992	0	a	'lol what's a launcher? what's a registry? lol steam thinks you played it while i crahsed lololol' -The Game's Launcher  I wanted to play this game, since I thought it was a free alternitive to GTA V or something like that, so I got it, and installed the assets. When I clicked played, it gave me an error saying that the game could not load itself into the Windows Registry, then it quitted. Then I relaunched it. Stuck at the splash screen. Launched it again, at the launcher, clicked Play, it just quits, Steam does not register it as a crash, but a 'You played a game!' sort of deal. So I just gave up. Hopefully they will fix it.
993	0	a	Okay, I don't write reviews at all so don't take this as a grain of salt but a whole flippin' mineral.  It's bad. I downloaded this because of nostalgic memories, playing this at my exes house and actually somewhat enjoying it. This was what? 4-5 years ago. Not sure what human smashed their head off the keyboard to produce the code and ideas I see present now.   As I write this the game is loading, I just checked and it disconnected me. Now, that sounds all fine and dandy if it wasn't the second if not third time this has done this....  Honestly, the only reason I have 5+ hours on this game is because 2 was spent on customizing my character and the rest was loading screens or errors.  Save your time and find a better game.    Love, a disappointed and drunk peep.

999	0	a	This game sucks more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ than a two cent â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. You go against people who are 10X your level, pay2win everywhere you look, and worst of all, the company reminds you of modern Blizzard (Which sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥) Don't bother playing this game if you don't have money to spare, because it's either be scammed and buy weapons, or lose and waste space.
1000	0	a	It's a p2w. If someone has spent some money in this game, and he is in the enemy team,you are so dead. I don't like how when I started to play,Proffesional players was killing me nonstop in missions. I spent total of 910+ hours.        FFS Make this game play to win not pay 2 win. .I.
1001	0	a	G1, are money grabbing jews that dont give a fk about its players/customers. Always talking up new updates never delivering. Its been over 2 years now with no new content, only pay to win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 3Ds max clothing.  Have over 6000 hours ( didnt use steam client to launch all the time ).  DONT GIVE IN TO THE JOKER BOXES BS EITHER!
1002	0	a	I do not recommend this game because it's own and run by Gamers First. Whose real name is actually 'Gamers Last' or 'Gamers? Never!' this company doesn't give a damn about players. Their support is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, their 'anti hackware' is not only completely buggy and full of vulnerabilities but they also get countless false hits. They use a program called 'Punkbuster', that 'Scans' your system for anything that 'looks' like a hack tool, often getting false hits (Like Torrent Software, Developer tools, worm scanners, hex editors, anti-virus software, a variety of programs and even other games) and sending it to Punkbuster developers called Evenbalance and the company who owns and moderates the game. And although other games use it, those companies have a filter to tell what is a hack and what isn't.   Gamers First doesn't do this, they will ban you for ANY reason, even if it's unjustified and unreasonable, even if you weren't hacking you will still get perma-banned. No second chances, no investigations, no support, no interactions, no nothing. They will refuse to accept any and all tickets, they won't communicate with you, they won't listen no matter how much sense you make and even if you have proof and evidence that you weren't hacking. They don't give a damn about players. Even if that player is a founder in one of their games and has put a lot of money into funding their games. They KNOW their system is broken, they KNOW their software gives them false hits, they KNOW Punkbuster is the worst anti-cheat software ever made, they KNOW they are banning innocent players all over the place, they just don't care.  Play this game and any game run by Gamers First at your own risk. But don't trust this greedy and cruel company with ANY of your money. Don't buy anything from them. Don't put any money into any of their In-game cash or store items or vanity clothing or anything. They will quickly ban you as soon as they have your money and spit in your face like you were nothing but trash. Because to them, all gamers are trash.   Now for the actual review of the game. This game is what you would call a rage game. It is completely saturated with crap and played only by trolls and children. This game will stress you out and make you want to pull your hair out. It is purely PvP and caters to players who are in clans and gangs. Playing this game solo is not advised as you will get picked on, abused and trolled even from the start. The game is practically almost completely pay to win and because this game is like an MMO GTA game, a lot of kids are drawn to it. This is Gamers First cash child, cause so many dumbasses are freely giving away their money into this piece of crap game.  APB Reloaded is actually monitered closely by the faulty Punkbuster software, and they WILL ban you for no reason. The tiniest hit on ANYTHING that the software *THINKS* is a hack will get you automatically perma banned. Even if you don't have any software that can be mistake for a hack, doing something as simpley as clicking too fast or moving your attack button to your mouse wheel so you can fire semi-automatic weapons rapidly just by scrolling your mouse will get you banned. (Sadly, I read that there have been players banned for doing this, simply using the game's own key binding changing option only to get perma-banned.) What's even more ridiculous, is that there are tech savvy players have figured out ways to bypass the punkbuster software and are aimbotting left and right. Don't believe me? Play the game and do a mission, see that guy who keeps killing you with head shots while sprinting at full speed with a pistol? Yeah he is one of them. While there are hackers rampant in the game, players who *ARE NOT HACKING* are getting perma-banned all over the place.   Still don't believe me? Google Gamers Firsts Bans.  you can also go here.  http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/301621-november-16-false-positive-bans/   ^That statement is false, as my account was one of those mentioned in that post and I never got my account back. And despite this 'claim' gamers first is still banning people unjustly through these 'false positives'. The false positive they got from me is still unclear, as I never cheated in my life in ANY game. Yet one day i get a noticed I got banned for using a 'macro'? okay, sure, whatever. I don't even know how to use macros.  My honest to God recommendation? Avoid this game and all Gamers First games like the plague, there are a lot of games out there that do what these games do but far better.
1003	0	a	The worst company =&gt; Unnecessary gamersfirst =&gt; Inane apb rel... They do not deserve you
1004	0	a	there arent many people in cetain groups which means some people cant play the game properly
1005	0	a	Before I re-installed the game through Steam I had been playing APB for more than 2 years. What caught my attention to the game, apart from the fast paced shooter mechanics, was the mind-blowing amount of customization, encompassing character, clothes, tattoos, cars, death themes, etc. This is, I think, the unique selling point of the game, as I haven't seen something so broad in terms of customization in any other F2P game. Some of the holiday events made by the devs were genuinely brilliant and my liking of the game eventually got me to spend some money to support the devs so they could fix the server issues, lagging, etc. Sure, since Day 1 one of my biggest issues with the game has been the considerable amount of toxicity, but then again the developers are not to blame. Oh, and the occasional hackers too... oh dear. But whatever, I loved APB.  Then the Fire Natio- sorry, the Server Merge happened (supposed to fix the lag).  For crying out loud, what happened?! More lagging!?  It's disappointing to see that most of the server issues, weapon balancing, severe lag, (add any other claim made by the players) haven't been resolved and instead G1 has focused on releasing re-skins of weapons in their insanely expensive Cash Shops. Now I am partially kicking myself for having spent money on the game, but I really hope that the devs can turn this game around and actually listen to the players for a change. Until then I'll keep playing APB (I spent a good amount of money in the game, so I might as well continue even if it pains me).

1007	0	a	Boring and clunky. Games looks average.
1008	0	a	Cops 'n' Robbers... sounds great doesn't it. The concept that hearkens back to boyish childhood games. Yay!  But this... *sigh* I can't recommend, even if it is free.  Gameplay:   Yes, there is a wonderful range of customization to your player and vehicles, but dress up dolls does not make for a fun game.  The aiming controls are not precise, add that to nerfed down guns and distance shooting is always a roll of the dice unless you get right on top of your opponent and overkill... and even then you may not score.   The matching system is ridiculous. The three metal system of Bronze (noobs) Silver (noobs) &amp; Gold (usually P2W) causes countless whispered curses when paired up against a Gold opponent. Being repeatedly slaughtered is not 'fun'... except for the sadists that pay $25 for a digital super gun to do it.   Missions and Content are.... BORING. The game is built around one thing... GRINDING. It takes forever to max out the criminal boss you're pledged to, all for lackluster rewards... most of which can be obtained by criminals through smash &amp; grab looting and mugging. When on mission it's the same thing over and over... thin... VERY THIN... explanations on why you have to kill vigilantes and criminals. Simply put: It didn't make me enthused at all to be the bad guy.  More fun can be had by simply piling cars up and exploding them, and that's sad.  Where are criminal on criminal missions? Or enforcer on enforcer competitions? Hello? Massacres? The NPC pedestrians are barely treated like they exist.... why not missions with penalties and rewards for damages done to civilians? It has NO imagination. It's supposed to be blissful anarchy! Where's an evil super genius behind the scenes for some truly diabolical missions?!!!  Sound:   The gameplay aside... The sound is great.... and the soundtrack is good for discovering new unheard of bands. Too bad it doesn't have a constant rotation or a lineup of new bands to keep introducing tunes while preserving community favorites.  Community: Ahh... the community. The genuinely good humored players are overshadowed by whiners and griefers. Butt hurt noobs that whine about being killed or cheated a kill... and even more that countlessly accuse others of hacking just because they can't get over the idea that 1. The game cheats. and 2. They suck. Though hacking does happen, it's usually not the case over the general unbalanced nature of the game.  Overall: It's fun for a few hours each year, but eventually deleting the pointless maelstrom of discontent doesn't cause any feelings of loss.
1009	0	a	Too many â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ enforcers, not fun when the experianced guys pick on newbies. #NotCoolMan #JustNo

1011	0	a	This game is garbage and so is Gamers First.
1012	0	a	Character creation was fun.  That was all the fun this game had to offer.  Edit: Honestly, yeah, I'm an APB scrub-- and for a reason. This game is purely all show and no go just as much as it is a pay-to-win scheme of a game. (And based on your hours, I guess you fell for that.)   The developers would much rather keep their blockheaded playerbase happy with updates that exclusively include more guns rather than EVER updating the game's engine or fixing/ adding onto APB's bland as balls gameplay. I mean, don't get me wrong, I guess I can see that driving around and doing the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over and over again could be amusing to some people. But I feel like that's just a very small demographic of likeminded people who require little to no mental stimulation.   This game literally offers nothing new or innovative and the hours you'll spend on it before realizing that there's nothing more to it, are spent making up characters or customizing other things.   I don't know. Say what you will, but every other review for this game just rolls over the same points I just made.   TL:DR I'm a scrub but this game still sucks donkey â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Abridged Version for the APB: Reloaded Playerbase:  'yo, y u spendin' yo money on dis gaem when dere nothing 2 do lmao dis girl buggy as hell an she aint got no game, playa.' 
1013	0	a	So much hackers and pay-to-win players you end up not knowing which is which
1014	0	a	I can't play the game because it says it's running. I wouldn't reccomend it only if you know how to fix it or you wanna be frustrated
1015	0	a	Tutorial is useless, you enter a 'beginner' zone clearly overmatched against all others you are against for the missions. Driving physics are horrid and the shooting is a whole other story of crap. Would not recommend to anyone, waste of time.
1016	0	a	  This game is a sespool of juvenile players.
1017	0	a	if you want to get camping police that camp at your objective, get this game  if you want to get owned by a guy that absorbs your whole magazine and insta kills you with 3 or 4 bullets, get this game  if u want to suffer failing missions because of camping policemen, get this game  4/10, too many camping pigs  all serious though i love the idea of being a criminal or a cop and doing missions while being able to customise your person or vehicles in many different ways but you will have an extremely difficult time playing, exspecially if your a criminal as you will get policemen that are like 30 or more levels above you camping at the objective and ruining your day. at random times a special weapon will appear and who ever has it when the timer runs out then they get it. normally the weapon makes them unkillable like one time where a grenade launcher spawned and while he was busy firing at the enemies infront of him i sneaked up behind him and fired a whole clip into his head before having him turning at the speed of light and blowing me to bits. when you are doing missions (mainly if your playing as a criminal) you will get to the very last objecitve and just when u reach it 3 policemen will just join the mission and pretty much make the mission impossible to complete. if this game was more balanced and didn't have people who are complete bullet sponges then i wouldn't of have uninstalled this game. overall i would recommend u get this game if you want to play as a policeman but if you want to be a law breaking criminal mastermind then u got no chance.
1018	0	a	This game just will not behave. I made an account before I downlaoded it, launched it and logged on useing the account I made. Then it said it was invalid, so I made another account, and THAT did not work, then a third, and months later I downloaded it again, useing all three acounts to login with, and all of them were invalid. It is still like that, and I did not get an email for my roblem yet when I sent in a report, so I do not reccomend this game...
1019	0	a	Still a waste of time. If your a casual player this isnt your game. If your a hardcore player this isnt your game. If your a dumbass cash cow this is your game. Please step right up with your credit card placed tightly between your buttchecks and bend over for MoneyFirst.
1020	0	a	It wont let me go past the updating even when its finished it &gt;:O
1021	0	a	R.I.P. APB. It was one of my favorite games despite never spending a penny. From the reviews I am glad I didn't. We all got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed about as badly as Payday 2 players did recently.

1023	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!! It is just not fun when you can't firstperson or have to walk all the way across the city. There are probably 10 car in the game and most suck at driving. I'm going to leave it there.

1025	0	a	Do you see those 25+ hours I have on record for this game? Not a single second of that was in-game play-time. You see, it actually took me more than 25 hours of trying to get the game to actually start to realize that no matter how good the game was, it wasn't worth it. So, ignoring whether my computer is just screwed up (which I doubt, I've never encountered this problem in other games) or something, I can't quite say that I recommend this game to others.
1026	0	a	I played this when it was just APB, remember RTW?, yeh that long ago. It was flawed but fun then, When G1 got it, it well went downhill fast, everything is P2W,sooo many hackers and very unstable servers. Also if you log out by cancelling the game by task manager or Alt+Tabing you get banned for hacking...   DO NOT BUY, its ruined.

New players have nothing to say here, they are going to get torn to shreds by grenades and high level, out of balance P2W guns literally during their first mission. Cars behave awful, game looks mediocre, gun handling seems â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Complete waste of time, unless you want to have a go with custimising aspect of the game, which is amazing. But the grind to get money WILL be very repetitive/painful.
1035	0	a	Well that was 3.7 hours I'm never getting back.  APB, apparantly, was once a brilliant open-world game with players joining the ranks of either the police force or the criminal thugs as they battle it out in gamemodes and on the streets. However, it went horribly wrong at some point and now we are left with this mess.  APB was and still is an open world shooter with missions, ranks and unlocks, and granted, I enjoyed my first hour or so customising my thug to be what I liked to call 'Bootleg Batman'. I had read the reviews saying that its horrible and its 'A good game gone bad', but I was willing to give it a go.  My first hour went something like this, I opened the game and was greeted with a character customisation screen. I've always been a sucker for customisation options so I was eager to get started. When I did eventually finish I got into the game, did the tutorial (there wasn't much of one anyway) and drove my car around. I began looting shops for the next hour and then I decided it was a good idea to do a mission. How wrong I was.  The mission went horribly. The people against us had overpowered rifles and rocket launchers, and they just ploughed through our cars like they were made of tinfoil. After this, I came to the conclusion that it was just a fluke, an unlucky game. I tried a few more, it was the same thing. I did this about 10 times before giving up entirely.  My point is, is that there is no balance system, so noobs and general idiots don't get cut any slack. Not to mention the disgustingly cancerous community. I'm pretty sure I became a tumour after I was finished with this game, it was either Russian fetuses shouting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ or some idiot blaming everyone but himself for not winning, and don't even get me started on the open world trolls. You cant even walk 6 feet without getting your brains splattered all over the badly textured walls by some sniper that's half way across the small 'open world' map.  To finish off, don't get this, don't think of it, don't even think of thinking of it, otherwise you will get tumours. Either that or you'll play long enough to become the tumours.  tl:Dr here:  Pros:   Customisation system, and a good one too, its fleshed out and you can customise all of your car and your clothing  Cons:   No balancing system, low levels get the benefit of losing their faces to high level sniper rifles repeatedly  The cars handle horribly, its like I driving on ice  The textures are terrible  Cancerous community, take your pick from Russian fetuses, 6 year old idiots and human swear machines  Trolls (also cancerous, but deserves its own listing), snipers camp the  rooftops rocket launcher guys stalk the ground, and smell the fresh noob meat.  Grindfest, takes a week to get anything of value.     Just, don't bother with this.
1036	0	a	Game should be called 'Fashion Show With Guns'. Everything in this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ except customization.  It used to be fun, but now it could get shut down and I wouldn't even notice or care.  I hope G1 goes super bankrupt, because regular bankrupt is too good for them.
1037	0	a	This game nearly destroyed my computer! It is so buggy and so unorganized that I could not do anything, play with any of my friends, most of the time I couldnt play it at all. It takes half of your lifetime to get it downloaded and logging in takes up more time than me actually playing this piece of trash. I had to turn my computer off 4 times in 2 hours because it froze my computer or prevented me from playing anything else. I feel like an old person after how much time I've wasted trying to give my effort purpose. How could Steam even consider bringing this horrible mess into their beautiful community of great to way better than APB Reloaded games. Gaben hear my words you awesome god and burn this evil game of devil spawn at the stakes, please.
1038	0	a	The game was built on a great idea, throw a few dozen players into a few square kilometer districts where they either become vigilante cops or hardened criminals. They than get into small groups with random players and go play various missions against the opposing faction. You start small; you're poorly dressed, drive a weak two door car, and have an assault rifle and pistol. But you team up with your friends, than suddenly a couple hundred hours into the game you're roaring down the street in a pimped out muslce car, hitting the Nos, with your teammate standing on top, shooting opponents with a rocket launcher.  Sounds fun right? Well too bad, because  Gamersfirst  Moneyfirst repurposed this game into a fully-automatic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-You-Up-the-â™¥â™¥â™¥-and-Steal-Your-Wallet Machine. The in-game guns you can buy are pretty damn good. But despite what the stats say, the ARMAS Marketplace guns (the guns you pay for with actual money) are most certainly better. The matchmaking system was coded by a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ monkey. You're a silver threat Rank 85? Awesome! Here's your teammate, he's a Green threat (lowest threat in game, you don't even START at green), your opponents are 3 Rank 255 Gold Threats with ARMAS weapons. Good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing luck! I wish I was exaggerating that last bit. The game has a pretty limited selection of vehicles, and even the fastest car, even with all the right mods and Nos, can only reach about 55mph, due to engine limitations, or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ netcode, idk, either way,  Gamersfirst  Moneyfirst doesn't care enough to fix it.  But I will give it this, what it lacks in actual fun and gameplay, it nearly makes up for in customization. This game has, by far, the best character customization of any game, ever. I'm not over exaggerating that part either. The customization is absolutely superb. Vehicle customization is also pretty damn good, as long as you pay premium so you can put more than 7 decals on your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing car, trust me, it's hard to design an actual squad car with less than 7 decals.   In the end, unless G1 sells the game, it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing done. I don't see redemption for it anytime soon, and most other players see it the same way. Don't bother with it, it's near worthless without going p2w.  Besides that, my friend in a dump truck launched my ambulance 200 meters in the sky, 11/10 APB: Space Program
1039	0	a	this game is a typical pay to win with guns that are immensely overpowered from the in game purchases
1040	0	a	I'd rather rip my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and feed that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to a dog than play this game.
1041	0	a	played about 10 hours, i didn't enjoy it, but as it is free it was worth it
1042	0	a	This game is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ worthless dont even waste your time â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trash â™¥â™¥â™¥ game no wonder why its free its free for a reason
1043	0	a	It sucks
1044	0	a	Nearly all of the hours I have in this are updates.
1045	0	a	Short and simple, about nothing in the game actually works  Being said, the game has been out for years and still has server and possible optimization issues  Besides the technicals, driving is fairly dreadful and the gunplay for the most part isn't much better  Missions are fairly run of the mill and will expect a lot of camping or just annoyance that the enemy has a better gun for the situation  It is however an excellent fashion simulator if you have the time to put up with the rest of the game
1046	0	a	I have been playing the original APB Beta and the final product and i have to say the game got worse.   - You cant permanently purchase weapons. You are only able to buy them for 10 days each which honestly does my head in. This punishes every player who is not willing or able to sink in 3-4 hours daily.   - The social district is way to confusing. Back in the days of the original APB there where those Customisations stands all over the place, you literally could not miss them because there was at least one of each kind in every building. Now there are one of each in the whole drisrict and finding them is a paine in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because there are no markers or directions.  - Matchmaking is nonexisting. I had to play against several groups of R200+ players who all where equipped with premium gear whhile i myself have been R20 and my teammates even where lower on level. What is the point of this? Nobody can tell.  - The same lag issues that where in the Beta of APB are still present in APB: Reloaded. The best example is how unresponsive the vehicles are. You litterally have to turn a second early because the car takes about a second to recognise your input even on a server that displays to have a 60ish ping.  I could go on and on about how badly executed APB: Reloaded is. But let me put all that into a single sentance. The game is worse than the Official Beta of APB has been and the beta ended about 4 years ago.  Dont waste your time on it and mor important dont waste any money on it.
1047	0	a	I thought I'd give this game a try after hearing about it via word of mouth.   One element that I love, is the character customization and being able to design unique outfits with the designer mode and the player/map interaction. I've only tried playing as a criminal character so far but honestly as a new player I've found it next to impossible to win gunfights and get kills, whether that's due to hackers or not I'm not sure because on numerous occaisions I've scored multiple hits on players and they haven't gone down, yet I get taken down almost every time with only a few shots.   It's not newbie friendly by any means and I'm pretty sure the matchmaking doesn't work at all, everyone I go up against seem to be much more experienced, their clothing designs are a giveaway since you get next to nothing early on. The game itself is also very laggy and vehicle controls are absolutely horrible &amp; unresponsive as vehicle steering also seems to be linked with mouse movement.  To summarize, it's not an enjoyable game for new players and is not one I'd consider spending any real money on since the developers don't seem to be all that engaged with the players, nor fixing obvious flaws with the game &amp; actively dealing with hackers IG.

1053	0	a	I tried loving it, gave it so many chances but in the end I just cant bring myself to play it anymore
1054	0	a	You cannot purchase any permant weapons without spending real life cash. Did my very first mission in the game with another new player and did not stand a fighting chance against our opponent who had far superior weapons then the basic starter gear. This is deffinately a Pay to Win game by design would avoid at all cost unless you want to spend a lot of money to be stand a fighting chance in this game.
1055	0	a	I come from an unwealthy family and I broke my LCD monitor because of toxic kids in this game that used pay to win weapons. I loved the game for the customisation but it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks donkey â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OATJAOWJTWA  Edit: I actually have far more than the 23 hours on steam, I have around 400 hours in this game
1056	0	a	Pay to win.

1058	0	a	This game is fun.   I am also a compulsive liar.
1059	0	a	its honestly trash
1060	0	a	Before I abandon this game for good let me say it's been quite ride and this is my final no holds barred honest review of this game. Make what you will of this review I am going to try and cover everything I saw good and bad, so you can make up your mind about it yourself but go in informed.   Pro's 1) Customization is great and you can do anything you really like, that to me is the hallmark of this game and it's greatest area it excels in, I myself did design and sell some great Bishada Rapiers when I played but it alone is not enough to keep me playing. But I reccomend it for customization options, and for that I give a 10/10 on the ability to do so.  2) Driving physcis is also nice, you have a variety of cars and how they handle varies by car and how you kit the body. However as someone who appreciates and enjoys racing in games this game has some really good driving physics, they did pretty good so even if they fail elsewhere this does help make up foe something.  3) Fight club is a great addition if your looking for pure action, however this comes with one of the cons that will be made apparent later, so please read further for the con of hackers/cheaters. Thr fight club is fun and challenging and you can getsomething you can use in game out of it if you do the objectives. Joker Tickets are something you can get some good stuff with but you need a lot of them. So for this feature yes I would say it's worth it if you just like combat or need to blow off some setam.  4) The car selection is great and you have a wide variety with many body kits, but these kits are ARMAS only and thus you have to pay in to get them. However there is enough of a variety of makes and models to satisfy anyone, though one shortcoming is a lack of motorcycles which would make for a more interesting experience.  5) The social district makes dealing with everything like customizing, selling, and hanging out with friends easy to do in a nice safe environment. Honestly it's a good idea to have, that way your not getting shot at while checking the market or ARMAS store. It is also the only area where you can go AFK and not time out from the game, so if you gotta go for an hour or two pop yourself there and go afk.  6) Weapon selection (non-ARMAS) is also expansive and covers a variety of weapons, however most of them are 10 day rentals for what you pay but it's worth it at times especially if they have slots you can fill your self with modifications. However there are also some real duds for weapons, and each weapon often is good at one thing but not good at another. However some advice, never discount your normal starter STAR 556 assault rifle. It is one of the best guns even if others would disagree, shiny new gun failing ya use your STAR. So IMO the weapon selection is nice compared to other games, as you can get a variety even if their temporary.  7) Modification system is also a plus, the various modifications allow for your own style of character, so to keep it simple this is a great feature.  Cons  1) The community is one of the most toxic communities in an MMO, when I did missions in bronze dsitricts you'd have silvers and golds playing there stomping everyone below their rank. Then they might say 'Get Rekt Noob' or something nasty and vile for kicks. This game has numerous trolls and A-holes who get their kicks in your misery, bronze districts are where most of the action are at but should be for bronze or lower only. Golds should stay in gold districts, and silvers should stay in silver districts. Also in social district you see a lot of sexual or perverse chat that is just distasteful, so often I ignored chat there. But as for more about this toxic community, I have been insulted and sneered at for even someof my hobbies if they came up in a conversation. A majority of the golds and silvers are elitist A-holes who like to wreck your day for easy wins.  2) Matchmaking/threat system is garbage, and as such makes for some very imbalanced matches that end up with one side having all of the advantages.  3) Small dev team means little gets done or it takes too long to do, therefore things they promised that should be out by now seem a long ways away from ever happening if they happen at all. The two biggest failed promises are the following. - Graphics engine upgrade - Matchmaking/Threat system overhaul  3) Hackers/cheaters are everywhere even with fairfight which JUST flags them and someone at G1 must ban them which happens more with the european servers than north american. If you want to play the frustrating fights against wall hackers, aim botters, trigger botters, and other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ go ahead. Cheaters are why I mostly stuck to ram raiding and mugging, to be perfectly honest.  4) F2P limitations are horrendous, for example as F2P you can only do like 7 decals on a car compared to 50 for premium players. You can do like 12 or so to clothing comparedto 50 for premium players, and so on and so forth. They really limit one of my pro's with these paywalls on how many decals you can use. This is a great sign of a Freemium game which EA has pulled off with SWTOR, don't get me started on that pile of garbage.  5) ARMAS guns are great if you can afford them, not so great if your facing them and cannot match them. Those pieces of crap can do much more than anything you can get normally in game, unless your skilled with your weapon type anyone using an ARMAS gun will likely wreck your day. So prepare to pay an armand a leg to get oneof these permanently, as inless your paying 2000 to 3000 G1C your just renting them for a limited time.  6) Map layout is a hot mess and each map plays itself to a certain style of play that really limits options, so if you would rather more rooftop battles use Waterfront, run and gun battles use Financial. However the maps are limited in size and some areas that look accessible are invisiwalled off.  7) GamersFirst themselves are a greedy company who only cares about your money, they do not enforce the terms of service so if that enforcer is camping the criminal money laundry and busting and defeating everyone who comes to cash out. Tough luck pal, they can camp the laundry and contacts with no consequences. Players can grief you, harass you, basically be abusive A-holes and they will not discipline players even if reported properly.  8) Graphics are quite dated and we have not recieved the promised graphics engine update yet, so if you prefer better graphics then this game is not for you. In fact they out a buffer memory limit on customization because of how much memory ittakes from the game to show every detail you put into something.  Overall I would not reccomend this game, it is clearly being kept on life support by G1 via ARMAS and the elitist A-holes who keep playing and paying into it. You'd think they would put more money into it, but they do not. I would rather play Defiance than this for an MMO shooter, or for another game check out Triad Wars as it may be more to your style. So goodbye APB, I will not miss you and I have given as blunt a review as I can.

1070	0	a	LOL, how does this game still have people trying so hard in it
1071	0	a	Don't play it. It's as simple as that.  It's an interesting concept but it was poorly executed, has terrible graphics and has a horrible, horrible... HORRIBLE community surrounding it.  I honestly don't know if this game is relevant enough to even consider thinking of downloading, just because of how awful it is.
1072	0	a	The only good thing about this game is the amount of Character/Vehicle customization.

1079	0	a	For the love of god don't play this game and definetly don't buy anything in this game. This game is so p2w that i can't describe it,it's a cancer that's milking money from the victims. So i beg you to not play it as it doesn't deserve to be played. You'll just end up rage quiting one way or another.
1080	0	a	One of the most unbalanced games I've ever played, and wasted money on, you have pistols that can out damage assault rifles and sniper rifles and if you want a good weapon you got to buy it with real money the ingame weapons they give you are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and this game has a lot of hackers. I can unload in a person with a good rifle and they won't die they hit me 3 times with a smaller gun or pistol I die. This game could be a lot better if it was balanced better and took better care of hackers. I play a lot of game and I'm fine with not being the best and dying now and then but come on, I even see people on the chat in game say how they are just gonna quit the game. I liked the game untill I kept running into the bs in the gameplay.
1081	0	a	I played this game for a little bit and was having a blast at first, but i found a lot more things that were very frustrating!!! We will start with the cons because there is alot of them!  Cons-  1. The game has a steep learning curb for new players. That's all I have to say about this because it speaks for itself.  2. The match making system is terrible!!! I went into my first match expecting a fun game but was destroyed by higher ranked players!!  3. Money- MONEY IS HARD TO GET!!!! as an enforcer you are at disadvantage when you try to make money because missions are your primary source of money the only good money you get is if you win a match. Criminals have it easier when trying to make money because they can raid stores, take stuff and sell it for small amounts of cash but its not much and if you want to buy good stuff you have to do this for hours which can be boring after a while. Money is essential in this game to get new stuff as it is in every game, but this game requires you to have a lot of money to buy stuff and you get money at a really slow rate.  4. Pay to win!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is my least favorite thing in any game because it causes balancing issues and deter's new players from wanting to play. I got so frustrated when I would put a full mag into a enemy player and he doesn't die then he turns around and fire 2 shots and I am dead!! This would be the thing the got to me the most and is what made me quit playing.  5. The community- Not all the players on this game are bad some were very helpful in situations when I didn't know what to do. A lot of people were very negative and said racist thing they would also threaten each other in the district chat. My team would get mad and start to cuss each other out alot which distracted me from the game and lowered my i.q.   Pros-  1. The clothing market! I was always excited to go to the social district and see how everybody designed their clothes because no one looked the same and the thing people could do with their designs baffled me! I was able to buy a few clothes and look completely different than anyone else and that made my character feel unique.  2. And finally the character creation- I loved this feature becuase they put alot of time to making sure that you look different than any other player in the game. There were tons of small features to choose from the nose bridge and the eye brow width just to name a few examples. Though there could have been more hair styles to choose from I was fine with the few I had available.  I would not recommend this game becuase there are a lot of issues with the game and it doesn't feel like they finnished the game. If i had to score the game i would give it a 3.5/10.  Thanks for reading my review! :)
1082	0	a	Suckass game it is...
1083	0	a	eh. its like gta but pay to win.
1084	0	a	It took me 1000 hours to come to my senses....  Don't be like me.... Don't download this...
1085	0	a	In this game, the graphics really remarkable game, but I want you to beat down the ....  But while the game continues to bounce phenomenon has come  Motivated to abandon the game makes this game hydroponic
1086	0	a	Got banned twice for cheating - R.A.T. mouse drivers. No contact with support, even that I spent some money on that game.
1087	0	a	The game is so buggy it says i am playin APB but i dont play it :( plz fix it
1088	0	a	I downloaded this because the picture reminded me of Jet Grind Radio. The game didn't so I uninstalled it.
1089	0	a	i have played this game for nearly 1000 hours. not on steam but when it was just by itself. i can say without a doubt in my 1000 hours, this game is nothing but hunger for money.  Dont bother playing. Pros - Variety of guns Variety of customisation of vehicles and character Fun in groups  Cons - Horrible customer service by APB Money hungry game No body cares about your opinion Hackers left and right Have your account hacked every few months and for APB customer service not to do anything about it. 
1090	0	a	I have spent countless hours on this game wasting a little over a thousand dollars on it (I'm crying) and everything was great until Fairfight was introduced now this isn't the same Fairfight from battlefield, this is the $5 version of Fairfight, basically what it does is it bans you from hack reports and your K/D ratio so if you do good your going to get reported for 'hacking' and you will get banned.. that's what happpened to me now for the sake of your life don't play this game!
1091	0	a	The Game where every second player are cheating...aimbot,wh.Play if you can...or can...
1092	0	a	What I like about this game:  - Awesome Character Customization - Good Car Mechanics - Great Art style - Amazing Party System - Music is awesome to (I like how you can import your own music) - Okay Graphics (Not complaing)  What I hate about this game:  - Match making sucks BOOTY - Laggy servers, and website - Sometimes I'd be the one shooting at someone first and they just be like *Cracks neck* BANG BANG, Two shot me. -_- - It seems like the Devs don't care about user imput :I - Hackers - SUPER UNBALANCE (Although I think I just said that) - Takes forever for new players to get to max rank on a pledge because, they loose every single round. - Join last 17 seconds of mission and then loose (come on, are you kidding me?) - Trial on weapons. It feels like they are depriving users of ownership of a weapon because they don't have real money to buy the actual thing to keep it. I don't like that crap, and it needs to go. - Enforcers seems to be a little OP, especially with their pepper inlaced bullets. - No cap on what rank goes to what server. Like seirously, GOLD should only go to GOLD servers, and SILVER should only go to SILVER servers, and BRONZE should only got to BRONZE servers. I freaking at it when Gold be sniffin' up on the Bronze Servers. It's kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ move on the Gold people's part.... - Other players can't listen to imported music. There is no point of importing music if others can't hear it as well....
1093	0	a	PAY TO WIN
1094	0	a	Well there are some goods and a lot of bads. I'll start with the goods and end with an in-depth overview.  Goods: -EXTREMELY vast customization options (though limited by lack of Premuim) -Fantastic Social/'chill out' District -Very easy to use and grasp -Decent backstory -Simplistic -Potentially great teamwork  Bads: -Hello hacker city -Pay to win -Customization limited by Premium/P2W -Godawful driving (the action-reaction delay is horrific) -Very awkward controls -It's on PC instead of console -Too many kids to count -VERY CPU instensive  Overview: Basically, APB is a simplistic, visually stunning, F2P MMO very much alike Saints Row. The variety of weapons and vehicles is nice, the customization is second to none and actually tops Saints Row and any other MMO and the gameplay is addictive, racey and smooth. Though the game does have a tendency for lag spikes.  Sadly, I feel the bads outweigh the goods. The ratio of hackers/cheaters to legit players is 50/50 or MORE on the hacker side unless you play with newbies. The P2W and Premium feautures of the game are disgraceful. You will be MILES above the rest if you purchase with real money - and a LOT of it. This also sadly limits the lovely customization. The benefits and potentially essentials you get from Premuim are completely unfair and a rip-off for what they charge.  The community for the game is frankly disgusting, too. Primarily due to it's fanbase being kids, low-esteemed 'girlgamers' and social-networking rejects. Expect to be called a noob and whined at in a moments notice and don't be suprised if the chat seems like it's been taken over by an army of 14yr old scene kids and CoDfans. The marketplace is lacking within this too. I would say that 'Gold Threat' players are far worse than any whiney tryhard in a CoD hacker lobby. Avoid them at all costs.  Verdict: Unless you're wealthy and willing to spend a good $120 on this 'F2P' game, willing to play with the newbies (which isn't bad at all), speak Russian, want a social MMO or have a bunch of clan-mates to play with, I would not waste time and memory with this game. It is extremely CPU intensive and addictive. Otherwise, gold-threats avoided, this is rather fun.

1097	0	a	The system requirements are insane, and even on a decent system it will lag and sometimes crash.   Also the last time I played (2012) it really was pay to win. Any decent weapon you would only unlock for a couple days before it re-lock itself, and you wouldn't make enough money to keep up with it. Then you'd go on some mission and a guy who spent a bunch of money would just 1 shot you with a rocket launcher while you had your starting pistol and nothing else. I hope they improved this since then, but it left a really bad taste in my mouth.  Overall it has a lot of potential and the world is chaotic and fun, but the points above make me not want to go back.

1102	0	a	Game always freeze and also you need to be an admin account to start the launcher. Please fix this. I'll be happy if this will be fixed in the future.
1103	0	a	it is an alright sandbox game with what you would expect but it suffers from many of the usual free to play problems evrything is way to grindy some guns are just straight up better than others and in general the gunplay isnt fun i wouldnt reccomend this game unless you had some friends to play with for a little bit 
1104	0	a	Honestly it's the best bad game I ever played. But in the end I'm sad I spent nearly 4 years playing it and almost 6 months of actual play time invested (that's 4k and a few hours) ( and no I don't login with steam often so it's less here.) that I will never get back, don't be fooled by the new paintjob it got with FF, FF is a s-hit anticheat and does nothing to save this game just move right along and play another game. Trust me it's not worth the time get good at a better or more important game.
1105	0	a	i playing this game for 4 years ' Non steam ' .... i can say apb is a great game but devlopers so much love money.they ONLY add new weapons and cars and etc to REAL cash marketplace... 
1106	0	a	gets boring, same routine and items. pay to get new items.
1107	0	a	Experience starting: 1: Toxic, immature playerbase rife with racial slurs and homophobia. 2: Poor balancing. First mission in the starting zone was put right in against two other players one with a grenade launcher. Not a good first experience. 3: There is no actual tutorial, you have to figure out everything for yourself, which is fine except plenty of things don't make any sense. IE you can't shoot at criminals in the midst of a crime spree unless your in their mission even though the game claims you can 'witness criminal activity with alt' to start a mission against them. Lots of unspoken rules, lots of players will lose their minds if you actually complete mission objectives. 4: Driving feels sloppy. 5: Gunplay feels weak. Headshots apprently don't count, certain weapons have so far been abysmal. Shotguns that can't kill beyond 5 feet, pistols that just can't kill even when you sneak around and initiate. Long time to kill makes the game feel like the shooter gameplay is tacked on. 6: All the guns cost money if you want them for more than ten days apparently. 7: Most of the civillians look identical. You basically have a city apparently populated by janitors and hookers who can't blink. 8: Customization has lots of options.  In all I tried to give it a fair shake but it disappointed me at most every turn. Was expecting a fun cops and robbers game where you could jump right into heists as they occur and create scenarios organically. Instead its basically a giant arena game with junky weapons and obscure rules that aren't explained. This is all covered in a festering morass of immature and rude players.  Didn't spend in the cash shop, I don't mind them in free to play games (gotta make money somehow) but the situation (temporary weapons and cash shop purchases) give me the impression they're trying to get the last drops out of this game before it dies completely.  3/10.
1108	0	a	If the creators of Second Life tried to make a GTA Clone, this would be the result.
1109	0	a	This game is not free...
1110	0	a	100% pay2win. Its very terrible and has too many confusing menus and just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s up your eyes after playing for a couple horus .-.
1111	0	a	Good for the money (nothing) but it gets rather boring very quickly.  The game doesn't hold much for people not playing with friends, since it's either hard to communicate or you get stuck with a pack of people who don't know what they're doing.  Aside from that, premiums get very big advantages, including one shot weapons, which sort of removes the 'free to play' element.  If you've played everything else, and you want something for you and your friends, get it -- if there's something else, don't.
1112	0	a	Dare devs, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you... this game was awsome, i stoped for a bit because of work, and i come back and i start it up, and after teh update guess what i get.

1120	0	a	P2W at its finest. When I played it first few years ago it wasn't so bad, you could kill the opponent. But now? You don't have chance as free player. Better launch GTA muliplayer.
1121	0	a	I had a very sorrowful experience with this game a couple years ago. Filled with cheaters and negligent staff. I felt like leaving a review, because I had spent thousands of hours playing and upwards of $500 in the game. The company managing this game (Gamersfirst) is incredibly horrid and I would not recommend playing this game to anyone. Wish I could have avoided it.
1122	0	a	It dosent even let me play the game correctly
1123	0	a	Poorly optimised piece of sh*t being taken care of by a company that only cares about your money.

1126	0	a	After a few years since i played this game, the cars still drive like on ice and there is no balance. hate it
1127	0	a	pay to play . no freedom on symbols , clothes, cars u need pay for all ............ 1,3,15,30 or more day unless ur limited at 3,7 symbols per cloth,car..... HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!
1128	0	a	Welp I guess i should explain a little of my history with this game, I was a beta tester for apb reloaded (not the original) the game at the time looked great and had the potential to be better then or equal to GTA. I played this game for a very long time with a friend, until for some reason we both quit the game. I didn't remember why we left, It was vague but I felt sick just thinking about the game. 3 years later I felt like going down memory lane to see if the game is still kicking. I got my friend back into trying it again. And once I press the play button, it all started to comeback to me like a fever dream. With a slap to the face the game reminded me why this game was terrible. After 3 years its still the most unbalanced, exploitive, laggy, and grief filled game I remember. Seeing that the loading screens with the dial-up sound effects are still in the game makes me vomit.   Maybe I should go over what I loved about this game before kicking it in the balls with fury of a thousand suns.   Pros: Customization- This is probably the best level of customization I've ever seen in games, even AAA games fail to bring this level of control to how I want my character to look. Its a pretty simple system and I'm surpised not many games do it. Theres custom cloths, cars, themes, and etc. It really is where I use to waste alot of my time in the game.  Match Making- This is gray area for me because I both hate and like the match making. In apb you choose to have a death match(fight club), or go into the districts to have some random match making as you drive around when your ready. I spent most of my time in districts because that much more familiar to me then fight club. Drive around with a friend then randomly a call goes out to steal some stuff or defend some stuff or keep some stuff ( Mainly a crim by the way). Its exciting to be thrown into a match, but its bad when its far away or when its already being taken.   Now that I'm done taking about what I like about the game, lets go over why I left this game.  Cons:   LAGGY- Even during launch this game wasn't this laggy, I tried looking into why this is. Apparently they've been getting ddos attacked for a while. How many times? I don't know but enough to keep lag constant in this game.  Punkbuster- I've been gone a very long time, but I'm sure that punkbuster security still sucks right.   Cars- Car are still feel like crap on the road, I maybe able to tolerate the cars in this game. That does not mean I like them in anyway.  Guns- Some people tried to convince me that this game isn't p2w, but when I saw my friend go from 2 or 4 kills to 8 or 11 a game with just using a code for a weapon from the market place. I gonna say thats bs, the premium weapons have less recoil, some have more damage, mods, etc. And if you get to rockets ro gernade launchers say goodbye to balance because they are crazy.  Character modifications- Clotting agent is the only one you need, kevlar is worthless and makes you slow.   Districts: After all this time still only 2 districts waterfront and financial, all with no real changes or improvements. nothing about these areas are interesting and I feel like I know these place backward and forward.   This game could of been good, but its still what I remember a piece of crap I played before. ( And yes I know about the engine upgrade, I'll try it again when It drops, then be mad at myself later).

1137	0	a	This game is an awful P2W madhouse. The only reason I have so many hours in it is that the game did not shut down properly and was still read as 'running' by steam. I did not pay a single penny but I still felt ripped off.
1138	0	a	This game requires another 200MB after isntalling with steam and if you verify your installation it gets caught in an endless loop of wanting to redowload the whole 6gigs. FAIL.
1139	0	a	it lags way too much and i have a good computer
1140	0	a	Pay to win. Ekh... Sure it's fun-- but completing missions is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with fighting all of the people who spent money on the game.
1141	0	a	i can play this game 
1142	0	a	I heard a lot about this game from my friends, unfotunately I cannot get it to run on my 280x for god knows what reason, it updates nicely and then fails at launch..  I've tried every possible solution to it, no luck so far.  I'm running Windows 8.1, drivers are up-to-date.
1143	0	a	This game is a giant Microtransaction. It revolves around your purchases and is the essence of P2W. This game had such potential, but they devs turned it into a disgusting sack of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that I will never touch again. I Can't complete any missions without some naked â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ running around with a Golden LMG and RPG between her cleavage while I'm stuck with an Anti-Material rifle that shoots Butter and Chick Peas. The community is toxic, too. I've only met 1 nice person, and he was P2W, too. I understand why you need to add Microtransactions, but, for the love of all that is holy and untainted, don't make the Premium â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ TOO OP. Learn from Valve. They made TF2, which you can play for nothing. You can best everyone without paying a single penny. It's not constantly shoving 'Deals' and 'Special Offers' into your â™¥â™¥â™¥ all the time. The vehicle mechanics are Pretty decent, though, (Kudos :3) but it feels like the tires are coated with Cillit Bang Bleach, Translucent Vasaline and Lemon Lube mixed with spit. I played this back in 2013, and Only recently got back to it. Still hasn't changed. (Neither does war. :3) I have nothing else to procrastinate about, because I wanna go watch some Animemes, so i'll tell you a story of what happened in APB Reloaded to me.  I Load into the Financial District, excited to see what had changed, When I pressed K By accident and got shot into a Mission faster than the Speed of Light. I was put into a Vehicle Drop-off mission with someone with the Default 'CPA In Training' Shirt and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ trousers, and a Battle-hardened P2W Girl who was, pretty much, butt naked with an RPG and Golden .44 Squished between her crack and cleavage. I was stuck with the normal STAR 556 at the time, so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my life.  We got into our Cars, the Newbie's being the first car you get, and the P2W Girl's being something that popped out of a Tron Movie that had morphed with the General Lee from the Dukes of Hazzard. I had something that resembled a Dark-grey Golf GTI, and we set off. Little did we know that they were lying in wait.  As soon as I turned the corner to get the Vehicles, I was bombarded my Bullets and Cooked grenades. I felt like I was in a Video made by FRANKIEonPCin1080p (I Love his channel :3). I pressed onwards, but my car was shredded up within 5 seconds because of someone with, what looked like, a Portable .50 Caliber Heavy Machine Gun firing from a roof opposite to me. I made a run for it, and managed to get behind cover, but someone was there. Waiting. They busted a cap into my buttcheeks with some Futuristic Asiimov Rifle from Battlefield 4's New DLC, 'The Piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ future'. The P2W Girl on our side had gone behind the enemy, and had blown her into space, creating the ABP Space Program as she did so. I was feeling the adrenaline. I jumped into my car and sped to get the pick up, when... all of a sudden...  I got Teamkilled by the P2W Girl. And we lost. I then proceeded to drink Brake Fluid for a Panzershrehkt Tank Destroyer, which destroyed my Organs. And i Died.  Fortunately, I got better.  I'm basically saying that this game is a waste of time and money.
1144	0	a	It's like a really bad version of GTA 5
1145	0	a	Bad game...very bad.
1146	0	a	This game is good until it radomly puts you on missions were you dont even have auto ready up on wich if they dont fix im telling my friends who play and dont play not to play until this problem is resolved.
1147	0	a	Just so terrible
1148	0	a	The game froze on me before I got to do anything and said I wasted a huge amount of time on it. Rating- -60/10 60 hours really?
1149	0	a	If you like paying money to boost your ego then this is probably thÃ© best game for you.
1150	0	a	This is the worst game of my life cant even open and i think also not connected to steam need wad â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ email adress agn so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idiot games. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IS JUZ WASTING UR TIME!!!! NOT RECOMMENDED
1151	0	a	Cons: -GTA but P2W and horrible imbalances, with the non-P2W being horribly punished untill you go full out P2W.  -Toxic community, worse than Dota's. Somehow are proud that the game's P2W, probably because they're inferior to everyone in every way so they need to dish out for the best weapons possible to feel good for once.  -Game runs poorly, graphics are completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yet it somehow runs worse than GTAV  Pros:  +Good if you want something to cross the line and help you finally suicide.
1152	0	a	Matchmaking system is terrible, keep getting repeatedly matched against fully geared players despite being brand new. Game has its charms but loses those charms quickly after the 50th rocket-induced death animation. Excited to not play this game again until they sort this crap out.
1153	0	a	Nah m8. Memories of the game consits of horrid ping (I'm in Australia, so obviously so) BUT every other game I play, where I play in an American server, does not give me a 1 - 2 second delay from when I press a key to when I move in the game. APB Reloaded is the only game to do this. That isn't even the worst part. Horrible P2W, so much scripting and hacking and a horrible community. My biggest memory of this game was when I was in a mission and my team was so close to winning but a person outside the mission drove and parked a van right over the checkpoint we needed and continued to sit in the van and wait there until our timer ran out, once it did, he drove off. There was nothing we could do about it.
1154	0	a	its crap you cant even play it it glitches out and screws your steam up i close it and it shows that app is still running

1160	0	a	As fun as the multiplayer is, if you have computer with anybit less than minimum, you will have nightmares of lag and latency. this game is far more taxing to a computer than anyone would expect.
1161	0	a	game dosen't even launch, had brief moment where it did work and it was ok but then stoped working again. can not recommend
1162	0	a	I have played this game for a little while and it is one of the best piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pay to win free to play games in existince you have to run around and get blown up by rpgs every 5 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing seconds very newb freindly just kidding if your a noob quit now if you want to enjoy the game you need to go to the web site give $500 and suck thier â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and you will get the best weapon in the game the rpg this i have no absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s about becuase it is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game the only good part is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing player customization i literly didnt give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about grammar writing this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.

1166	0	a	Before I re-installed the game through Steam I had been playing APB for more than 2 years. What caught my attention to the game, apart from the fast paced shooter mechanics, was the mind-blowing amount of customization, encompassing character, clothes, tattoos, cars, death themes, etc. This is, I think, the unique selling point of the game, as I haven't seen something so broad in terms of customization in any other F2P game. Some of the holiday events made by the devs were genuinely brilliant and my liking of the game eventually got me to spend some money to support the devs so they could fix the server issues, lagging, etc. Sure, since Day 1 one of my biggest issues with the game has been the considerable amount of toxicity, but then again the developers are not to blame. Oh, and the occasional hackers too... oh dear. But whatever, I loved APB.  Then the Fire Natio- sorry, the Server Merge happened (supposed to fix the lag).  For crying out loud, what happened?! More lagging!?  It's disappointing to see that most of the server issues, weapon balancing, severe lag, (add any other claim made by the players) haven't been resolved and instead G1 has focused on releasing re-skins of weapons in their insanely expensive Cash Shops. Now I am partially kicking myself for having spent money on the game, but I really hope that the devs can turn this game around and actually listen to the players for a change. Until then I'll keep playing APB (I spent a good amount of money in the game, so I might as well continue even if it pains me).
1167	0	a	Boring and clunky. Games looks average.
1168	0	a	Too many â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ enforcers, not fun when the experianced guys pick on newbies. #NotCoolMan #JustNo
1169	0	a	Cops 'n' Robbers... sounds great doesn't it. The concept that hearkens back to boyish childhood games. Yay!  But this... *sigh* I can't recommend, even if it is free.  Gameplay:   Yes, there is a wonderful range of customization to your player and vehicles, but dress up dolls does not make for a fun game.  The aiming controls are not precise, add that to nerfed down guns and distance shooting is always a roll of the dice unless you get right on top of your opponent and overkill... and even then you may not score.   The matching system is ridiculous. The three metal system of Bronze (noobs) Silver (noobs) &amp; Gold (usually P2W) causes countless whispered curses when paired up against a Gold opponent. Being repeatedly slaughtered is not 'fun'... except for the sadists that pay $25 for a digital super gun to do it.   Missions and Content are.... BORING. The game is built around one thing... GRINDING. It takes forever to max out the criminal boss you're pledged to, all for lackluster rewards... most of which can be obtained by criminals through smash &amp; grab looting and mugging. When on mission it's the same thing over and over... thin... VERY THIN... explanations on why you have to kill vigilantes and criminals. Simply put: It didn't make me enthused at all to be the bad guy.  More fun can be had by simply piling cars up and exploding them, and that's sad.  Where are criminal on criminal missions? Or enforcer on enforcer competitions? Hello? Massacres? The NPC pedestrians are barely treated like they exist.... why not missions with penalties and rewards for damages done to civilians? It has NO imagination. It's supposed to be blissful anarchy! Where's an evil super genius behind the scenes for some truly diabolical missions?!!!  Sound:   The gameplay aside... The sound is great.... and the soundtrack is good for discovering new unheard of bands. Too bad it doesn't have a constant rotation or a lineup of new bands to keep introducing tunes while preserving community favorites.  Community: Ahh... the community. The genuinely good humored players are overshadowed by whiners and griefers. Butt hurt noobs that whine about being killed or cheated a kill... and even more that countlessly accuse others of hacking just because they can't get over the idea that 1. The game cheats. and 2. They suck. Though hacking does happen, it's usually not the case over the general unbalanced nature of the game.  Overall: It's fun for a few hours each year, but eventually deleting the pointless maelstrom of discontent doesn't cause any feelings of loss.
1170	0	a	Very laggy not worth trying it... Also maid my laptop frezz and gave it bugs
1171	0	a	I'm still curious about hackers/ it is a good game but there are too man hackers and they ruin it. How can I say it's Free to Play and Hack to Win, example Wall hack, aim bot, speed hack, etc.
1172	0	a	This game is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ worthless dont even waste your time â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trash â™¥â™¥â™¥ game no wonder why its free its free for a reason
1173	0	a	This game is fun.   I am also a compulsive liar.
1174	0	a	Nearly all of the hours I have in this are updates.
1175	0	a	I thought I'd give this game a try after hearing about it via word of mouth.   One element that I love, is the character customization and being able to design unique outfits with the designer mode and the player/map interaction. I've only tried playing as a criminal character so far but honestly as a new player I've found it next to impossible to win gunfights and get kills, whether that's due to hackers or not I'm not sure because on numerous occaisions I've scored multiple hits on players and they haven't gone down, yet I get taken down almost every time with only a few shots.   It's not newbie friendly by any means and I'm pretty sure the matchmaking doesn't work at all, everyone I go up against seem to be much more experienced, their clothing designs are a giveaway since you get next to nothing early on. The game itself is also very laggy and vehicle controls are absolutely horrible &amp; unresponsive as vehicle steering also seems to be linked with mouse movement.  To summarize, it's not an enjoyable game for new players and is not one I'd consider spending any real money on since the developers don't seem to be all that engaged with the players, nor fixing obvious flaws with the game &amp; actively dealing with hackers IG.

1188	0	a	Let me first start off by saying that, since RTW went bankrupt, This game has been going further and further down hill every since it was turned into 'Reloaded'.  The game as it is now, is a disaster. Although it's a free to play game, there is probably 80% of the population that are cheating, It's a typical G1 Game and i wouldn't recommend it, even though it's F2P. I've played this game since it was in Closed Beta with RTW, and if it had of stayed dead after RTW, it atleast would of been a good memory.  Gameplay - 3/10 - It used to be much better, but now it's horrible.  Community - 2/10 - 80% of the players if not more, are cheating, and will try to grief/troll you because they think they are good.  Development - 1/10 - G1 Do not know what the word Development is, The game has pretty much everything RTW had, and whatever RTW Didn't have out already, G1 Just used the ideas RTW were going to implement and released that as their own work. The only thing that gets updated on a regular basis is the Cash shop.  Anti Cheat - 1/10 - The anti cheat is a joke, and it's even got to the point where some blatant cheaters that were caught and banned, have been unbanned via the GM's/Devs of the game because they 'know' them.  Overall Score - 1.75/10 is the average of all those scores put together, However i am actually givine it an  Overall score of - 0/10 - Because i think it should of just stayed dead and remained a good memory rather than it being torn to shreds with G1.  Recommendation - Although it's a F2P game i would stronlgy recommend you DO NOT try this game, If you want to, then do it, afterall it is F2P. But don't say i didn't warn you.
1189	0	a	So full of W2P items and hackers.  People were openly talking in general chat, about how there are only two ways of enjoying this game:  And i quote directly: 'There are two ways of enjoying this game, either you spend money in the Armas store, or you spend money on hacks'   Enough said.
1190	0	a	first i launch it, it won't let me play it so i close it, and it deletes it from my library 1/10000000000 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good
1191	0	a	Nothing more than â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, Sorry gamefirst, But your stupid pay to win system is too much for me.
1192	0	a	When you think about character customization, you may think of some asian mmo... well wrong. No other mmo will give you that much pleasure form creating your own character.  Everything your character do is what you do and when you are owning the game, it feels good. Endless fight between enforcers and criminals is just briliant.  At the beginning everyone thought cheaters (coz they r no hackers) will destroy the game and you know hat? We were all wrong. Killing cheating noobs was fun, but(t) real stab in the back was delivered by GamersFirst.  From sexy game concept, they made dirty moneygrabing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's completely unbalanced, clunky, and it's PAY TO WIN and what GamersFirst did is unforgivable. It's a shame that they turned APB into pile of filth.  As much as I like this game, I can't recomend it. It should die and maybe after few years someone less greedy than them will remake it just as it should be.  Selling guns is killing this business, leave the game don;t download it let it die or maybe it will force GamersFirst to put gamers first for real.
1193	0	a	APB Reloaded. This game. I can't really think of a place to begin. This game is awful. Flat out pay-to-win noob destroying, mindlessly violent game. I was pretty enticed by the opening art. That is literally it. When I was put out into the world I was put up against unbalanced pros that absolutley destroyed the learning curve. This game is 100% pvp. No middle ground to get a feel for the game. And no legit training area. The training area is pvp. And of course can be invaded by pay-to-wins. This destroys the game. The story behind this game just seems more like an excuse for this game to exist than an actual game. The graphics are sub-par. Not bad but not great. The only thing that this game has going for it, is the over the top customization. I've always been a sucker for customization so that is how I discovered this little crapper. It also doesn't help that a good portion of customizations can either be aquired through hundreds of hours of devotion, or money. I know this is a F2P and thats to be expected but I cannot stand pay-to-win games. Especially if your game is nothing but pvp! What kind of horsecrap is that!? What were they thinking?? They did nothing to balance this garbage at all. They just give you a junk rifle and put you up against the pros during the tutuorial and wish you the best of luck. And the gunplay itself is dominated by snipers. As a game I give it 22/100
1194	0	a	its a gta ripoff and like most free to play games you have to create a second acount somewhere else to play it 
1195	0	a	well many hackers like in every game whit guns lol
1196	0	a	Its a good game but its a pay2win game :/
1197	0	a	The phtos and videos you see make it look a lot better than it really is, and what would make this game better would be: You dont loose all your money when you die, no noobs, no spawn killing, no pros in the recruit area, more cops, less criminals, less competiotion, rid of team betrayal when you're not ready and most of all clothes. Like, who wants to mug 48 people for a plain hat? COME ON! If you die once, you start again. Horrid game. If all this was changed, i'd re-install it... but nobody ever reads these things.
1198	0	a	would be amazing if they fixed it.... great game, i bought it twice at first, thats like 40$ before it came to steam

1204	0	a	Tried logging on again after a few months, my character gone and game support is doing nothing to get my character back. Game is also broken, from it's server lags and greedy game developers (approximately $30 for one gun!). The game is pay 2 win, barely any customization for free users. Would not recommend this game!
1205	0	a	Wow...Not only does this game have a horrible 'recommendation' quota...  It also didn't work on my newly bought and built-to-play-games Ibuypower pc...  What a beauty to behold. I can not play this game at all yet I can still rate it conveniently...
1206	0	a	I have never said this about a single game I have ever played and im going to say it now. this game is cancer and needs to just be burned to the ground, servers and all. i have played this game for a good few days worth of time. if you are new plan on being trolled by everyone at all times. the community in the game is toxic and vomit inducing, this game is P2W so if you don't plan on paying money, plan on being the worst player on the server. the pay weapons have a demo version that makes them completely usless in every way. no joke you get to use a airsoft version of the gun for 30 minutes. (some how other players with the same weapon are able to 1 shot you a mile away like some kind of SMG sniper rifle) oh and im sure you are thinking 'oh ill just play for fun because its free!' well let me tell you right now that even if you do get into the game, the anti cheat system is bogus and broken. aim bots, clipping through walls, teleporting across the map, one shot kills from everyone but you. yes thats right this game is a broken pile and if i released this game i would be embarrassed, apparently this game just came out for xbox one and soon to the PS4, maybe it will be better on console but im not going to hold my breath. 2/10 for making a terrible GTA clone that only has 1/30th of the actual content.
1207	0	a	This game should still be in its alpha stage with how bad it is. The company doesn't do anything to help improve it. All they do is add crap pay 2 win guns that no one uses and skins. Barely any game fixes the game requires. If you going to play this game prepare to rage quit all the time, yell, scream, throw small children and light you pants on fire. Game started out fine then when south... fast. I have wasted so many hours and so much money that I am embarrased to talk about it. I would rate it about a -13 out of 10 but I can't sadly. So good luck GamersFirst, I mean GamersNever and I hope your company burns down one day out of overclocking those toasters you call servers.
1208	0	a	I can honestly say I miss this game for the game play and customization, but that's it. I don't miss G1's horrible service or the rampant hacking OR the horrible people playing the game. Sigh... What a waste.
1209	0	a	Worse game ever, they don't even give me a chance to learn the tutorial, got knocked out trice at spaw point, worse worse worse I hate this

1213	0	a	A lot of people say this is a pay to win game.. It's not.. It's a pay to be slightly better than you were before but still getting destroyed...  1 SMG=27$? That's ridicoulous...  This game is UN-COMPLETABLE if you don't spend money.. Like.. a LOT of money...
1214	0	a	Basic rundown of APB mechanics:  Miners (known as 'Criminals' in-game) run out and 'mine' stores for ore, or 'mine' civilian NPCs for ore. Then they load their load of loot into a car - which they pick up GTA style usually - to drive it to the shopkeeper to sell each individual peice.  Police (known as 'Enforcers' in-game) run around attacking miners whenever they manage to lay eyes on a miner when they do any of the above. Police can start a battle against miners and kill them to take all of their loot.   The miner faction is unable to attack police unless police start attacking first. This setup lends the power 100% to police. Police typically [always] just don't start the battle if they don't see a win from it. This usually tends to mean the police will have a severe advantage over the miners if they attack; a group of three or more against a single miner, outrageous weapons comparitibly, or outlevel the miner immensely. Almost always by the time the miner knows they're under attack they're already half dead (or less than a second form being run over) and haven't a chance to make up for the poor head start.   Ironically it feels like they gave the mechanics to the wrong factions. Enforcers are usually the antagonists and Criminals are usually the innocents in this game. It doesn't help that the situation causes most Enforcer players to get very cocky and the Criminal players to get very defensive.  The server is unstable. It crashes constantly; which sucks mostly because it takes about 15 minutes to load the game completely and it can last as little as 10 minutes before another crash.  The community is FULL of confirmed hackers on both sides. If you go into higher ranked areas you'll be tracked through walls and hit with aimbots. Lower level PvP is fun, but don't attempt to play to be the high rank. While there are no doubt some legitimately skilled players there are far more hackers. As far as I can tell hackers don't even get banned for hacking.   Final verdict:  The game is alot of fun. Sadly its mechanics imbalanced and it's full of hackers. The Enforcer faction is also highly antagonistic (albiet due to understandable environmental and psychological circumstances). I'd recommend anyone that still has any desire to play to avoid going Criminal faction. It sounds fun and cool when you hear about it but you can't do anything but be killed and robbed.
1215	0	a	well having about 400 hours on the game and spending approx. $200 i get banend for 'cheating' and after that its just horrible, game is only focused on irl $ and without $ theres no fun to it

1217	0	a	Back when I had my crappy good ol' Pentium 4, the controls lagged like hell. When I upgraded to a half-decent computer in 2012, the controls lagged like hell. And now that I upgraded to a pretty decent gaming computer, the controls still lag like hell.  In all seriousness, the game itself is fine. The gunplay is what you'd describe as 'good enough', nothing fancy or innovating, but it works. The main problem I had is that the character customization actually lying to you and, as previously mentioned, the car controls. On the topic of characters, once you finish painstakingly customizing your looks (Which you can't change without paying an absurd amount of money I may add), your avatar looks barely like the one you created, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I tried to replicate Frank West and ended up with Sloth from The Goonies.  And as far as the vehicle controls go, they're bloody awful. The cars themselves handle fine, or at the very least the Not!Audi TT you get at the beginning of the game, but there's an almost one second delay between you pressing a key and the car actually doing something, which obviously results in you driving like you drank half the stash of illegal alcohol you were ferrying around town. Sadly the community isn't very helpful when trying to fix this issue, as most of the replies you get are 'You suck', 'The game is pretty big, deal with it', or 'The game is fine, upgrade your rig' which the latter is kinda hard to do when you're running almost top-of-the-line hardware. I'm not TotalBiscuit, goddammit, I don't have enough money to buy four Titan Xs.  In short, if you can run Crysis 1 at 240 FPS on 4K resolution, I'd give it a shot, otherwise either don't; or get ready to do some cardio, as you'll be running all over the city.

1224	0	a	I have played APB for a short time, when I first started playing I got gold my first day, I was having fun, but as soon as you hit high ranked servers, you're dead, the game is no longer fun because you can't kill cheaters, or people who are just too good at the game and should stop playing it.   APB's Customization is the best customization I have ever seen in any game, you can design your car the way you want to, you can put anything on it and it's completely up to you. The character customization is also great, I managed to make my character look exactly like Rambo and had a blast doing it.  APB's Gameplay however is not the worst, and not the best I have seen in a game. It seems they have worked more on the things that don't matter as much as they have on things that do. Certain guns need to not be implemented in the game, I enter a gold server, I always get matched with someone that has a rocket launcher and just uses it the entire match, how many rockets does that dang thing have with ammo? If it stays implemented, you should only get 1 rocket per life, you know how much those things weigh? And why is everything that is completely OP only available to higher ranked players? I'm gold with a Shaw with no Mods on it, and they are gold with ANY GUN THEIR HEART DESIRES WITH MAXED MODS ON IT. And you just can't win, somehow they beat an LMG (Shaw) with a pistol. I don't get it, there are no bullet physics in the game, headshots do not matter, the only skill required is to be a troll and lean back and forth behind a wall until you kill someone.  I loved the game at first, but I have learned to hate the game. I have literally played the game for 5 days now and went from loving it to hating it. APB, if you want more players, change. Change what the community wants you to change.  Will NOT play again. 3/10

1232	0	a	if you want to get camping police that camp at your objective, get this game  if you want to get owned by a guy that absorbs your whole magazine and insta kills you with 3 or 4 bullets, get this game  if u want to suffer failing missions because of camping policemen, get this game  4/10, too many camping pigs  all serious though i love the idea of being a criminal or a cop and doing missions while being able to customise your person or vehicles in many different ways but you will have an extremely difficult time playing, exspecially if your a criminal as you will get policemen that are like 30 or more levels above you camping at the objective and ruining your day. at random times a special weapon will appear and who ever has it when the timer runs out then they get it. normally the weapon makes them unkillable like one time where a grenade launcher spawned and while he was busy firing at the enemies infront of him i sneaked up behind him and fired a whole clip into his head before having him turning at the speed of light and blowing me to bits. when you are doing missions (mainly if your playing as a criminal) you will get to the very last objecitve and just when u reach it 3 policemen will just join the mission and pretty much make the mission impossible to complete. if this game was more balanced and didn't have people who are complete bullet sponges then i wouldn't of have uninstalled this game. overall i would recommend u get this game if you want to play as a policeman but if you want to be a law breaking criminal mastermind then u got no chance.

1249	0	a	Character creation was fun.  That was all the fun this game had to offer.  Edit: Honestly, yeah, I'm an APB scrub-- and for a reason. This game is purely all show and no go just as much as it is a pay-to-win scheme of a game. (And based on your hours, I guess you fell for that.)   The developers would much rather keep their blockheaded playerbase happy with updates that exclusively include more guns rather than EVER updating the game's engine or fixing/ adding onto APB's bland as balls gameplay. I mean, don't get me wrong, I guess I can see that driving around and doing the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over and over again could be amusing to some people. But I feel like that's just a very small demographic of likeminded people who require little to no mental stimulation.   This game literally offers nothing new or innovative and the hours you'll spend on it before realizing that there's nothing more to it, are spent making up characters or customizing other things.   I don't know. Say what you will, but every other review for this game just rolls over the same points I just made.   TL:DR I'm a scrub but this game still sucks donkey â™¥â™¥â™¥.

1255	0	a	After playing this game for more than 15oo hours, none-steam and spending 500$. one day upon logging in I get disconnected and the ban hammer fell on me, after contacting support and meeting a bot called Dastard who kept sending me the same and same response, I lost all hope of getting unbanned and decided to take my revenge by writing this review, donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™m not actually going to bash the game or lie about it, just the plain truth coming from a guy who used to have 2 gold max ranks. This game has many glitches, its p2w not f2p, and there are a lot of cheaters. I personally could cope with the bugs, glitches and its p2win-ness. Sometimes can say I enjoyed them, found them funny, but the main thing that makes you want to rip your own eyes out is cheaters. Well on that subject, there are three types of cheaters, first we have low rank blatant cheaters who are really easy to identify and are banned in a couple of days, and then we have high level (mostly gold max ranks) closet cheaters that are unnaturally good and you just canâ€™t get to kill them. When you confront them, they say we are pro or we have ts or blah blah â€¦ sometimes you can see some of them who got caught on  ffbans.org . Now the third and the most annoying ones are whitelisted cheaters, G1 actually knows that these people are cheating hard but doesnâ€™t do anything just because they pay them a lot of money and if you dare report them, they ban you instead. Call me a conspiracy theorist or nuts, this has happened to people I knowâ€¦ they caught these people cheating on video and reported them and those legit guys got banned after 3-4 days â€œDUE TO CHEATINGâ€ themselvesâ€¦ coincidence right ??? so in conclusion, unless you are a masochistic I donâ€™t recommend this fail excuse of a game.
1256	0	a	This game was fun, until you ranked up and fight with all the p2w there is. Unless you are willing to cough the dough, then do not bother playing this.
1257	0	a	They need to add some servers for Australians. I wish I could thumbs up, but I can't stay in a game long enough to enjoy it.
1258	0	a	I never played this game, because the game never runs on my PC.  I hate it -1337/10
1259	0	a	I have played this game before it it was on Steam.   THIS IS A PAY TO WIN GAME.
1260	0	a	Lagging Servers / crashing lobbys / payed weapons are much better then regular ones / ridiculous pricing! (one weapon lifetime 60 bucks lol) alsmost forgot something.. i wrote them ones.. they never replied. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you GamerFist
1261	0	a	This is the welfare version of GTA.. but worse, waaayyy worse
1262	0	a	A complete waste of time with faulty matchups, unexplained gameplay and aspects of the game specifically designed to taunt you.
1263	0	a	As fun as the multiplayer is, if you have computer with anybit less than minimum, you will have nightmares of lag and latency. this game is far more taxing to a computer than anyone would expect.
1264	0	a	I can't do much of a review game never truly launched. I use windows 7 professional 64x. Pro free Con wasted about 90 minutes trying to get to play it.
1265	0	a	not as good as it could be, confusing and uninteresting after 3 hours it gets repetative.
1266	0	a	Hackers, cheaters everywhere, i never play it because it sucks, buy Saints Row and play with COOP for better experience.  Or apply for Triad Wars Beta , bette.r.

1269	0	a	Desparately needs some F2P servers, i've been in to far too many situations where I (as a bronze and silver, for a short time) have been put up against max rank golds with fully decked out characters. guns and cars. This game has absolute zero balance and unless you funnel half your life savings into their premium currency, you have no chance of getting anywhere.  Here's a tip for new players and people who are not vey good at FPS games; avoid the missions altogether, you'll be slaughtered every time an enemy spots you now matter what server/district you're on. The learning curve for this game isn't much of a curve, more like a vertical line.
1270	0	a	Started playing since the Reloaded beta. 2008 graphics/game, but you still need a mid-high end pc to run this without it FREEZING, barely new content has been added in +4 years, clothes, cars and re skinned guns, some cry about p2w but i think it is pure skill because (re skinned guns). 'Developers' (they cannot change game's code) are now trying to do tons of events giving players a lot of stuff for them to unlock certain clothes, etc, that's not enough, the game is dying, population is so damn low. The engine upgrade was meant to be released in Q1 2014, but they have only given some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pictures of the SOCIAL DISTRICT with more foliage and better lighting, not even gameplay. I don't even know how are they thinking of releasing a console version lol. They have to release the engine upgrade or just cancel this 5yr old beta.
1271	0	a	If you like playing one of the best games ever and they having it lagged server wide every 15 mins until you want punch out a dev, this is the game for you. I am literally the most calm person I know, and this games lagg issues â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off so hard I raise my voice and rage quit....... I NEVER rage quit and NEVER raise my voice. This game is literally making me a worse person. Gameplay is awesome, street fights are awesome, customization is UNREAL!! This sounds great until you lose 3 or 4 matches in a row because you are lagging for 1 min and 15 seconds you needed to tag a wall. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you devs, for making such an amazing game and then making it unplayable.
1272	0	a	If you read any review, you'll discover the community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. There are thousands of reviews that point out all the flaws, and you've probably already read them. So, for those of you thinking to play, here is a list of the different categories of a.sshat you will find in this game:  -Low level â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s: wear all stock clothing, but are suspiciously good, and proceed to teabag everyone they kill -High level â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s: wear 5 layers of neon clothing, steal their parent's credit card to buy 6000 dollars worth of in-game guns -Subhuman stoner culture: A group of jackas.ses who wear leather jackets with cannabis leaves printed on them. Are annoying and likely have never touched a joint in their life -Trolls: people who fu.ck around and try to offend people with swastika patterns on cars and clothes. Probably the friendliest group. -11 year old kids with Asperger's: usually have in-game girlfriends (who are secretly catfish) and blast shi.t.ty dubstep in the social district. -Chat spammers: Ra.pe chat with annoying and useless text to one another. Rudely ignore everyone else and type so much that global chat has basically become their own private chat -The Man: The one guy, wearing all stock clothing, with no customized cars or clothes, who mysteriously has a f.ucking OSMAW and rap.es the sh.it out of everyone on the server, even the untouchable high-level p2w nerds. -You: The one, single, normal person on the entire server. Caught in a clusterfu.ck of a feud between all of the aformentioned groups.  Sounds like fun? Of course it does!
1273	0	a	oh my god I play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at 16-20 fps and I'm so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good at it  but this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  don't download it  pls.

1280	0	a	The game would be fun if i didnt get destroyed everytime i joined a match/mission because everyone is decked out in strong gear and demolishes me as someone with almost no gear because i just started the game.
1281	0	a	i spent 2 hours trying to open this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game and it still did not work
1282	0	a	It's like TF2: New players are noobs. If you're not P2P you're a noob - you are a F2P 'scrub'. Weapons are too OP, and fanbase is a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. GG
1283	0	a	Had a lot of potential but Gamersfirst are one of the most money-hungry game developers I have ever seen. They never push out any significant updates to improve the game and instead release useless Armas items and recycled events. Performance is garbage, still no sign of the promised engine update after nearly 3 years. I wouldn't waste time playing the game in its current state, just another unbalanced piece of trash. :)
1284	0	a	The only reason i got this was because i didn't bother to spend any money and want to practice driving for my driving test because i thought it would give me some level of experience.           I failed the test
1285	0	a	It's free, it's fun, and it got loads of customizations!  But sadly, the community is horrible, filled with trashtalkers and hackers.  It also get boring fast due to lack of game modes with PVP system only.  I wouldn't recommend this game lest you're the type of a gamer who's competitive or masochistic.
1286	0	a	Great game, looks attractive, nice gameplay and such.. But ehh.. Doesn't really want to run.. So...ehhh.. Yeah..
1287	0	a	Pay to win. Ekh... Sure it's fun-- but completing missions is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with fighting all of the people who spent money on the game.
1288	0	a	i can play this game 
1289	0	a	This is the worst game i have EVER played.Its horrible.
1290	0	a	This game is HUGE P2W(Pay to win) Note: I used to have the game before It came on steam  Now here is some good stuff and bad staff about the game  Bad Stuff: 1. The game really wants you to throw their money your money at them, while at the same time they try to seem generous 2. Just about all the good guns need to be bought,Including cars and clothes with Real money 3. Everyone who DOES pay for guns, are Way too Over Powered or just do really insane damage 4. You need to spend a ridiculous amount of hours to get enough cash for weapons that are DECENT,by that I mean guns that dont need 3 clips to kill someone  Good Stuff: 1. The games custimaztion is Pretty fun and you can make just about anything, Unless you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out money 2. The game has a nice healthy player base and there is rarley any hackers, but sometime the players who pay look like hackers..... 3. It isnt to graphicly demanding, so you dont need a high end graphics card to run this game at high settings  Overall, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing paid to win or spend a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on of hours getting money to get good guns
1291	0	a	It's p. bad in like, every way, I only play sometimes because my idiot friends want me to and theyre good company, despite terrible taste in games.
1292	0	a	No Australian servers so the latency is just awful and in most cases unplayable, it was originally disigned by Realtime Worlds but they sold the half finished piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to the K2 network for 2 million dollars... not that the game wouldn't be fun and enjoyable but it is still quite bad, on the plus side the character customization is insane, much like The Sims only without the clothes option. I honestly don't know why they can't just get off their lazy asses and get some Australian servers?

1299	0	a	This is the best time wasting game I have ever played. If you have a few hours to kill, you could do the tutorial and then just simply uninstall this game just like I did. The graphics are strong, but the game is lacking somewhat, far too much lag. I shot someone direct in the head, and they died 10 seconds later. They moaned first, then fell over, and then died, bluh.  Do yourself a favour and leave this game alone, it just ain't up to what it says on the tin. GTA wanabee, but GTA it will never be.
1300	0	a	Not worth the download.   Community is terrible, getting teamkilled during the tutorial for not knowing the mission metagame was great. The driving isn't fun, car handling is mushy and seems like driving on ice all the time(it's not winter). The weapons and shooting aren't great either, seems like a grind fest, but without anything to grind against. 
1301	0	a	this game in my opinion is terrible, yes it may have good customization but down to the fighting, and driving. It feels like im driving a noodle with wheels. and the guns sound like a hammer hitting the wall, i would not recomend this game to any one, unless they are looking for a social game!
1302	0	a	This is the welfare version of GTA.. but worse, waaayyy worse
1303	0	a	This game is fun.   I am also a compulsive liar.
1304	0	a	This game, is BAD. Let's start of by saying you play with the best players at the beginning of the damn game, who have all the best gear, the best cars, and can easily tank all the noobies around. There are hackers everywhere, I was just driving along my merry way down the street, with no enemy in sight, when suddenly, I died. I have no clue how that happened, it could've been a bug, but I blame hackers, none of the games I've played have ever shot me in the face while I drive down in the street. Have fun trying to get any objectives done, if you're a noob with a team of pros, you're going to make them fail, and it will only be you, you want to know why? BECAUSE THIS GAME SUCKS â™¥â™¥â™¥.

1306	0	a	I thought I'd give this game a try after hearing about it via word of mouth.   One element that I love, is the character customization and being able to design unique outfits with the designer mode and the player/map interaction. I've only tried playing as a criminal character so far but honestly as a new player I've found it next to impossible to win gunfights and get kills, whether that's due to hackers or not I'm not sure because on numerous occaisions I've scored multiple hits on players and they haven't gone down, yet I get taken down almost every time with only a few shots.   It's not newbie friendly by any means and I'm pretty sure the matchmaking doesn't work at all, everyone I go up against seem to be much more experienced, their clothing designs are a giveaway since you get next to nothing early on. The game itself is also very laggy and vehicle controls are absolutely horrible &amp; unresponsive as vehicle steering also seems to be linked with mouse movement.  To summarize, it's not an enjoyable game for new players and is not one I'd consider spending any real money on since the developers don't seem to be all that engaged with the players, nor fixing obvious flaws with the game &amp; actively dealing with hackers IG.

1318	0	a	This game is jackshit. It is literally impossible to play, there are no instructions on where to go, I was lost like an asian kid at the Supermarket. Like oh my god, I didn't even know how to put on clothes. Apparently there are 2 sides. Cops, and criminals. I chose the Cops first because I was curious. I spent about 45 minutes in the beginning tutorial, because they didn't say anything about going to your inventory. I quit on that side, and I went to the criminals side. Even more confusing, as confusing as a Rubik's Cube made By Stephen Hawking with the Theory of Relativity. I just started the tutorial and they just go, 'well, do this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and play.' And they don't give actual instructions. I just spawned a tiny little smart car and started driving around in the City crashing into other players. This game is a pile of donkey â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Don't even think about getting it. This is basically GTA's little autistic midget albino baby who is blind.  My friend recommended this game to me. We're actually not friends anymore.

1335	0	a	Before I abandon this game for good let me say it's been quite ride and this is my final no holds barred honest review of this game. Make what you will of this review I am going to try and cover everything I saw good and bad, so you can make up your mind about it yourself but go in informed.   Pro's 1) Customization is great and you can do anything you really like, that to me is the hallmark of this game and it's greatest area it excels in, I myself did design and sell some great Bishada Rapiers when I played but it alone is not enough to keep me playing. But I reccomend it for customization options, and for that I give a 10/10 on the ability to do so.  2) Driving physcis is also nice, you have a variety of cars and how they handle varies by car and how you kit the body. However as someone who appreciates and enjoys racing in games this game has some really good driving physics, they did pretty good so even if they fail elsewhere this does help make up foe something.  3) Fight club is a great addition if your looking for pure action, however this comes with one of the cons that will be made apparent later, so please read further for the con of hackers/cheaters. Thr fight club is fun and challenging and you can getsomething you can use in game out of it if you do the objectives. Joker Tickets are something you can get some good stuff with but you need a lot of them. So for this feature yes I would say it's worth it if you just like combat or need to blow off some setam.  4) The car selection is great and you have a wide variety with many body kits, but these kits are ARMAS only and thus you have to pay in to get them. However there is enough of a variety of makes and models to satisfy anyone, though one shortcoming is a lack of motorcycles which would make for a more interesting experience.  5) The social district makes dealing with everything like customizing, selling, and hanging out with friends easy to do in a nice safe environment. Honestly it's a good idea to have, that way your not getting shot at while checking the market or ARMAS store. It is also the only area where you can go AFK and not time out from the game, so if you gotta go for an hour or two pop yourself there and go afk.  6) Weapon selection (non-ARMAS) is also expansive and covers a variety of weapons, however most of them are 10 day rentals for what you pay but it's worth it at times especially if they have slots you can fill your self with modifications. However there are also some real duds for weapons, and each weapon often is good at one thing but not good at another. However some advice, never discount your normal starter STAR 556 assault rifle. It is one of the best guns even if others would disagree, shiny new gun failing ya use your STAR. So IMO the weapon selection is nice compared to other games, as you can get a variety even if their temporary.  7) Modification system is also a plus, the various modifications allow for your own style of character, so to keep it simple this is a great feature.  Cons  1) The community is one of the most toxic communities in an MMO, when I did missions in bronze dsitricts you'd have silvers and golds playing there stomping everyone below their rank. Then they might say 'Get Rekt Noob' or something nasty and vile for kicks. This game has numerous trolls and A-holes who get their kicks in your misery, bronze districts are where most of the action are at but should be for bronze or lower only. Golds should stay in gold districts, and silvers should stay in silver districts. Also in social district you see a lot of sexual or perverse chat that is just distasteful, so often I ignored chat there. But as for more about this toxic community, I have been insulted and sneered at for even someof my hobbies if they came up in a conversation. A majority of the golds and silvers are elitist A-holes who like to wreck your day for easy wins.  2) Matchmaking/threat system is garbage, and as such makes for some very imbalanced matches that end up with one side having all of the advantages.  3) Small dev team means little gets done or it takes too long to do, therefore things they promised that should be out by now seem a long ways away from ever happening if they happen at all. The two biggest failed promises are the following. - Graphics engine upgrade - Matchmaking/Threat system overhaul  3) Hackers/cheaters are everywhere even with fairfight which JUST flags them and someone at G1 must ban them which happens more with the european servers than north american. If you want to play the frustrating fights against wall hackers, aim botters, trigger botters, and other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ go ahead. Cheaters are why I mostly stuck to ram raiding and mugging, to be perfectly honest.  4) F2P limitations are horrendous, for example as F2P you can only do like 7 decals on a car compared to 50 for premium players. You can do like 12 or so to clothing comparedto 50 for premium players, and so on and so forth. They really limit one of my pro's with these paywalls on how many decals you can use. This is a great sign of a Freemium game which EA has pulled off with SWTOR, don't get me started on that pile of garbage.  5) ARMAS guns are great if you can afford them, not so great if your facing them and cannot match them. Those pieces of crap can do much more than anything you can get normally in game, unless your skilled with your weapon type anyone using an ARMAS gun will likely wreck your day. So prepare to pay an armand a leg to get oneof these permanently, as inless your paying 2000 to 3000 G1C your just renting them for a limited time.  6) Map layout is a hot mess and each map plays itself to a certain style of play that really limits options, so if you would rather more rooftop battles use Waterfront, run and gun battles use Financial. However the maps are limited in size and some areas that look accessible are invisiwalled off.  7) GamersFirst themselves are a greedy company who only cares about your money, they do not enforce the terms of service so if that enforcer is camping the criminal money laundry and busting and defeating everyone who comes to cash out. Tough luck pal, they can camp the laundry and contacts with no consequences. Players can grief you, harass you, basically be abusive A-holes and they will not discipline players even if reported properly.  8) Graphics are quite dated and we have not recieved the promised graphics engine update yet, so if you prefer better graphics then this game is not for you. In fact they out a buffer memory limit on customization because of how much memory ittakes from the game to show every detail you put into something.  Overall I would not reccomend this game, it is clearly being kept on life support by G1 via ARMAS and the elitist A-holes who keep playing and paying into it. You'd think they would put more money into it, but they do not. I would rather play Defiance than this for an MMO shooter, or for another game check out Triad Wars as it may be more to your style. So goodbye APB, I will not miss you and I have given as blunt a review as I can.

1337	0	a	If you want bugs, bugs, and more bugs, and long loading times, and bugs again. By all means
1338	0	a	i accidentally left this game open while sleeping
1339	0	a	nothing change
1340	0	a	1. click 'play'  2. wait to download files 3. click 'start'  4. game crash 20 times 5. delete the game
1341	0	a	Terrible Game. Just play ANY GTA.
1342	0	a	Game is an overall mess, developers are super indecisive and destroy the fast pace shooter I used to love... Oh and the cash shop is still overpriced.  Edit in Sept 2016 - The game is still just as bad, no engine upgrade still and cash shop is their priority
1343	0	a	I played it for 5 years.In the begining game was awesome later it was boring and full of hackers.. The biggest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is that u need to pay with real money for space weapons-opp to win.. As i told already game is full of hackers... The biggest one is that the game is not proteceted well i lost my 3 maxed chars 10mill in cash lost everything. Now im proud bcs i stopped playing this crap.. The Gamersfirst company only thinks about money u give...... If u pay them u r goood person if u dont pay u r no one remember that!!!!!!!
1344	0	a	This game used to be alright. Had a laugh playing with my friends after being new to Steam, only resorting to free-to-play games. Tried coming back to this after being bored and see what has changed, and well it is just utter wank. Too many problems to even be called a game anymore.   I'd rather watch myself get eaten alive by a rhinoceros which is getting it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed out of it by the largest sperm whale on the planet, because this game is just that awful.   If you don't have any money or you're a cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥ who don't like paying for games but want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about with your friends, then I kind of recommened this game. But if you got the money to buy any game, literally anything else, then dont even waste your time with installing this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The best part about this for me would be uninstalling this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tard of what you call a game off my system saving me the storage space with something remotely more playable.
1345	0	a	This game sucks. I love this game. I hate this game. This game should have won game of the decade. thats how i feel when i play APB: Reloaded. It is absaloutly NOT new user friendly, but, its fun to just screw around, not even doing the missions. thats what i do. even though there are constant lag spikes, and the driving is really clunky, i love to screw around. some may also say this a a p2w, its is, then it isnt, its not like its all: BUY STUFF 2 WIN DIS MISSION UNLESS U WANT TO DIE 400000000000000 TIMES!!! its more like: you can buy this is u want, but you dont have to if you dont want to. i like that aspect. it also reminds me HEAVILY of the GTA series. overall, with some fixes, it could be a great game. 
1346	0	a	It's a GTA clone without the charm of the characters, all the characters there is have the same bland 'bad boy/girl' theme to them, the voice acting can be pretty funny on some of them. Well, in my first hour of the game, i spawn in for the first time, guess my guns are ok, bullets come out one end so i can't really complain, then i get completely destroyed by somebody who payed hundreds of dollars on this game, fun fun fun! The customization this game boasts is soooo limited, unless you give the devs money, of course. Also, is it just me or is everyone with a female character dressed like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥?, with all that customization i would figure you could at least be creative. The gameplay is kinda stiff, but not horrible, driving cars feels like your wheels are covered in vaseline and it handles horribly, bad driving in a game where you need to get around ruins it for me, but just throwing in the PTW and crappy starting gear complete's the package. I give it a 2/10, dont bother
1347	0	a	i spent 2 hours trying to open this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game and it still did not work
1348	0	a	honestly just a waste of youre time
1349	0	a	The game would be fun if i didnt get destroyed everytime i joined a match/mission because everyone is decked out in strong gear and demolishes me as someone with almost no gear because i just started the game.
1350	0	a	It's like TF2: New players are noobs. If you're not P2P you're a noob - you are a F2P 'scrub'. Weapons are too OP, and fanbase is a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. GG
1351	0	a	Couldn't get into it, seemed like such a cool concept. Wasn't for me.
1352	0	a	This game is free to PAY  the microtransactions are VERY expensive, and worth less because the things you buy AREN'T PERMANENT, they stuff you buy with REAL MONEY are there for like a week. then you have to pay more. and if you are smart and don't pay money this game is slow and impossible to enjoy this game DONT'T PUT MONEY OR YOUR TIME IN THIS CASH GRAB
1353	0	a	The only reason i got this was because i didn't bother to spend any money and want to practice driving for my driving test because i thought it would give me some level of experience.           I failed the test
1354	0	a	I can't do much of a review game never truly launched. I use windows 7 professional 64x. Pro free Con wasted about 90 minutes trying to get to play it.
1355	0	a	A complete waste of time with faulty matchups, unexplained gameplay and aspects of the game specifically designed to taunt you.
1356	0	a	Might be fun sometimes but seriously, this game is just p2w (by the joker box weps) You will laugh at me of my time but im not on my main acc now, lol!
1357	0	a	game dosen't even launch, had brief moment where it did work and it was ok but then stoped working again. can not recommend
1358	0	a	Booty Game It Sucks P2W TO THE MAX Bad Mechanics U New U Suck thats life in this game 
1359	0	a	As fun as the multiplayer is, if you have computer with anybit less than minimum, you will have nightmares of lag and latency. this game is far more taxing to a computer than anyone would expect.
1360	0	a	I would not recommend this game to a single person unless they plan on pulling money out their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to be able to enjoy anything.  The community is horrible and consists of the same players winning over and over due to using the cash shop weapons and such.  There is no balance at all, you ready up and get thrown into missions with people that have been paying and playing for a whole lot longer than you.  Very rarely will you find a few people that are nice to play with.  Did I mention the community is a bunch of trolls?  1/10 the 1 in the rating is for that nice person who helped me beat a few ridiculously high level players in a mission for once
1361	0	a	I rate it Meme out of cancer.
1362	0	a	Was even effort put into this? I would rather say that all they did is just make the graphics good... there is about a thousand bugs and new players cannot even kill one enemy because of everyone buying weapons for real cash and be OP... So this game  IS NOT RECCOMENDED EVEN TO TRY!
1363	0	a	Where to start? Hackers, Team killers, Unknown lags (graphics), Money hunters, Bad support, Balance,
1364	0	a	I am going to compare this to GTA Online or Saints Row as it is that style of gameplay  1. Acess to fun:  GTA Online, I have to boot up the game, click on online, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  Saints Row, I have to boot up the game, join a friend, start the game, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  In APB Reloaded, I have to boot up the start menu, update the game, start up the game itself (Which sometimes opens up a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Facebook 'like this' page and you have to click Start again), Then select the character, then join the correct district then select the spawn and then have no idea where to go because you selected the wrong district and have no idea where to go.  Character Customisation:  In GTA Online it is the worst character creation ever, you choose the grandparents and parents and that's how your characer looks like, no wonder my character looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t  In Saints Row 3 and 4 the customisation is great. It leaves enough options to be extremely customizable but few enough to be simple  In APB Reloaded it is like Saints Row but the camera angles are confusing, the advanced mode gives too many options while the quick mode gives too little options. It is the worst of both worlds.  And that's as much of the game I know of. As it took too long to get any-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing-where with the game as it was complicated and boring to figure out where to go.
1365	0	a	I've been on and off this game for about 2 years. To me the game overall is a decent idea and the customization is the best i've seen compared to any other game. The things I didn't enjoy about this game is the matchmaking. Dispite what happened in the past with the flood of aim bots and hackers; The match making is also broken.   Why is it that a gold player can just decide to join a bronze server and womp on all the new players and get just as much money as they would in a gold server? THEY SHOULD BE AUTO KICKED, Threat levels should mean something, not just a color where they recommend you go.   fix this, or your game will crumble.
1366	0	a	10/10 Drama Simulator  I wouldn't recommend this game anymore. It was good till early 2015 when they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up the servers, the comunnity became bad and as I said the servers are performing horrible. Its dead. 
1367	0	a	Reloaded Productions put themselves i.e. ca$h over the community, don't bother.
1368	0	a	Trash
1369	0	a	This game isn't dead yet?  Is it completely funded by hackers now?
1370	0	a	full of cheaters
1371	0	a	It left something running in the background of my computer for 244.66 hours. I played for 20 minutes. 
1372	0	a	got banned for no reason spent over $500 irl dollars what a waste
1373	0	a	this game is an addiction i lost one of my very good friends to it...
1374	0	a	For some reason my game will not work, im getting very fustrated with APB reloded. When i try to load it, it just shows a picture of APB reloded and thats all, plz i need help.
1375	0	a	  What I liked about the game: There was nothing enojyable about this game. Apart from the Exit game button.  What I disliked about the game: Horrible graphics poor skin textures even on max settings. The mechanics of driving is not nice at all. The PVP matching is totally unfair for new players. Character animations are not aesthetically pleasing. I could go on, but I won't.  Personally I cannot recomended this game. 
1376	0	a	2/10, this game is one of the most pay2win games out there I have seen so far, incredibly unbalanced and not amusing at all, not worth the time spent. However customising the clothes is fun, too bad they are extremely hard to obtain too.
1377	0	a	It's meh. Really cool concept, good gameplay (if it works well, which it didn't on my old computer, and its performance still has some problems on my university wifi [not the game's fault, just a note]), but my only complaint is that it's Pay-to-Win,   Really sad that they killed such a cool game with such a horrible practice.  If you don't mind dumping money into a game to make it playable (or you don't mind making yourself so OP that the game is too easy [I know lots of you MMO players out there already do it]), then you'll enjoy this TPS, faction-based-warfare MMO.   Otherwise: avoid.
1378	0	a	WORST GAME EVER!!!!! DO NOT PLAY! I REPEAT DO NOT PLAYYY!!!
1379	0	a	Free to play my ***  This is the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. Community is cancer. Game is cancer. I got cancer. The end.  Excuse me while i go kill myself now :)
1380	0	a	When updating this game my disk usage is at 100%.   this program is 7GB of adds and background progams running at all times.    10/10 background apps
1381	0	a	Close to being one of the best games ever thats why i play it but there is still so much wrong with it 2 traniees vs 2 max rank golds with a OSMAW and Atac
1382	0	a	Too much hackers.
1383	0	a	Won't load for me.
1384	0	a	It's a p2w. If someone has spent some money in this game, and he is in the enemy team,you are so dead. I don't like how when I started to play,Proffesional players was killing me nonstop in missions. I spent total of 910+ hours.        FFS Make this game play to win not pay 2 win. .I.
1385	0	a	Game should be called 'Fashion Show With Guns'. Everything in this game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ except customization.  It used to be fun, but now it could get shut down and I wouldn't even notice or care.  I hope G1 goes super bankrupt, because regular bankrupt is too good for them.
1386	0	a	This game is alright. in my eyes i wouldnt play it 10 hours a day every day. this game is highly pay to win, and you dont get a lot for what you pay for. so many hackers in this game it isnt even funny. but all in all it is a great time waster. i just wouldnt recommend this game to people to want a fun game..
1387	0	a	Required me to like a Facebook page to play. Literally cancer.
1388	0	a	It's like cancer for cancer patients
1389	0	a	This game costs as much as it's budget.
1390	0	a	its exactly like minecraft
1391	0	a	Where to start? Hackers, Team killers, Unknown lags (graphics), Money hunters, Bad support, Balance,

1393	0	a	This game nearly destroyed my computer! It is so buggy and so unorganized that I could not do anything, play with any of my friends, most of the time I couldnt play it at all. It takes half of your lifetime to get it downloaded and logging in takes up more time than me actually playing this piece of trash. I had to turn my computer off 4 times in 2 hours because it froze my computer or prevented me from playing anything else. I feel like an old person after how much time I've wasted trying to give my effort purpose. How could Steam even consider bringing this horrible mess into their beautiful community of great to way better than APB Reloaded games. Gaben hear my words you awesome god and burn this evil game of devil spawn at the stakes, please.

1395	0	a	Pay to Win piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Uninstalling immediately
1396	0	a	0/10 Can't send mail to my friend. Don't play this game.
1397	0	a	Don't
1398	0	a	I put up with this b******* of a game for months i gave it a good chance I tried to make to seem good but as hard i tried this is a bad game,hackers Fairfight didnt do anythings this game tries to get u to open ur wallet more time that Steam Summer Sale (That is not possible though). If I had to Summirse i would say its a s***,broken version of GTA
1399	0	a	The idea behind this game is great; it's like GTA with a ton of customization for multiplayer.  Unfortunately, progression is painfully slow. After 53 hours of gameplay, the vast majority of which was spent in missions, I had enough money for a vehicle and 1 or 2 weapons that were only to last 10 days before disappearing. Also, I had barely unlocked any upgrades.   The matchmaking system is hard on newer players.  Here is a common matchmaking scenario:  Match 1: You're against newer players...either an easy win or it's pretty even  Match 2 (after winning match 1): You're against veteran players with dreamteam equipment or newer players that have dreamteam equipment thanks to the cash shop [either way, you're at a flat disadvantage]  After losing match 2, you return to match 1...and on and on     Regardless of your skill, you've gotta be willing to feed the game money or a whole lot of time if you want a fighting chance. Strategy only goes so far in this platform.  fun for only a short while
1400	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ matchmaking. Also, most likely, it will be a bunch of f2p's against a team full of premiums(premiums often have better weapons and experience). At night, the server is full of hackers using aimbot. The only thing good about this game is the customization. It seems like that's the only thing the devs put effort into this game. I recommend to not spend your money into such a bad game, if you are planning to play G4YPB.
1401	0	a	This game is alright. in my eyes i wouldnt play it 10 hours a day every day. this game is highly pay to win, and you dont get a lot for what you pay for. so many hackers in this game it isnt even funny. but all in all it is a great time waster. i just wouldnt recommend this game to people to want a fun game..
1402	0	a	A broke un-fair piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.......yet i keep going back to it, I don't recommend you get it because it's addicting, and you don't want to get addicted to this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it is extremely pay to win, save yourself the time and go play a decent game guys!
1403	0	a	So much hackers and pay-to-win players you end up not knowing which is which
1404	0	a	  Kat plays it so it bad, it hurt brain celss and iz full of hackerz
1405	0	a	This game is garbage and so is Gamers First.
1406	0	a	If you like playing one of the best games ever and they having it lagged server wide every 15 mins until you want punch out a dev, this is the game for you. I am literally the most calm person I know, and this games lagg issues â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off so hard I raise my voice and rage quit....... I NEVER rage quit and NEVER raise my voice. This game is literally making me a worse person. Gameplay is awesome, street fights are awesome, customization is UNREAL!! This sounds great until you lose 3 or 4 matches in a row because you are lagging for 1 min and 15 seconds you needed to tag a wall. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you devs, for making such an amazing game and then making it unplayable.
1407	0	a	I can't play the game because it says it's running. I wouldn't reccomend it only if you know how to fix it or you wanna be frustrated
1408	0	a	I'd rather rip my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and feed that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to a dog than play this game.
1409	0	a	this game is frustrating because for some reason i cannot close it
1410	0	a	Horrible. Got banned for buying premium.  If you want to try it, get some premium codes and get a free week of premium, then try it. Otherwise - it's so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I got so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing angry when they banned me just after buying premium. It feels like the moderators or administrators are 10 years old. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it right up its money hungry â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's like a blonde basic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ - waste some money on her, then she leaves you. At least the sex was good.
1411	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate this game but the customization too strong girl I cant quit.
1412	0	a	it was so bad, i couldnt even get on the game the 16 minutes ive played was on the installing screen and then when i wanted to exit the game i couldnt even exit it i had to force close steam or restart my computer
1413	0	a	  Complete Trash
1414	0	a	full of cheaters
1415	0	a	This game in its current state is complete and utter trash, along with its dwindling community. I'm not even going to THINK about touching this game ever again until they release the updated engine, if they ever even decide to release it. This game was a blast to play in its hay day, but it went downhill quick. Give me my APB back, I really do miss it. Unfortunately I'm going to have to give this game a bad review until they update it.
1416	0	a	'lol what's a launcher? what's a registry? lol steam thinks you played it while i crahsed lololol' -The Game's Launcher  I wanted to play this game, since I thought it was a free alternitive to GTA V or something like that, so I got it, and installed the assets. When I clicked played, it gave me an error saying that the game could not load itself into the Windows Registry, then it quitted. Then I relaunched it. Stuck at the splash screen. Launched it again, at the launcher, clicked Play, it just quits, Steam does not register it as a crash, but a 'You played a game!' sort of deal. So I just gave up. Hopefully they will fix it.
1417	0	a	Okay, I don't write reviews at all so don't take this as a grain of salt but a whole flippin' mineral.  It's bad. I downloaded this because of nostalgic memories, playing this at my exes house and actually somewhat enjoying it. This was what? 4-5 years ago. Not sure what human smashed their head off the keyboard to produce the code and ideas I see present now.   As I write this the game is loading, I just checked and it disconnected me. Now, that sounds all fine and dandy if it wasn't the second if not third time this has done this....  Honestly, the only reason I have 5+ hours on this game is because 2 was spent on customizing my character and the rest was loading screens or errors.  Save your time and find a better game.    Love, a disappointed and drunk peep.
1418	0	a	Pay to win.
1419	0	a	PAY TO WIN..... SUCKS.... WORST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED.... COPS SPAWN CAMPING WITH GUNS THAT CAN 2 SHOT YOU OR CARS....
1420	0	a	Pay to win and laggy servers, BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW FLOCKAVELLI.
1421	0	a	When you first start the game very hard. Even mid-hard. Once under stress and, it will be BIow. Bye ~ bye ~ bye ~.
1422	0	a	WORST COMPANY EVER..... the game was great but not anymore.
1423	0	a	This is a bunch of P2W trash.  Pros : The concept. Wide variety of guns, Clothing, And accessories. Able to make your own gopnik, blin. Who doesn't want that?  Cons : Everything else.  All in all, This game is a piece of trash, That I had very high expectations for, From what one of my friends told me. Big mistake, My friend. Big mistake.
1424	0	a	Pros:  None to fully give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about.   Cons:  Everything in this game is based around taking your money. Very unbalanced pvp. This game was fist made from the GTA guys and then they failed and then Gamerloft and they failed and now the cherry on the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ topping. Perfect World. (3 companies failed to make this a better game)  
1425	0	a	while the game is semi enjoyable, it is comletely and utterly Rekt'd by Pay 2 Win Contents and makes playing the game pointless and not worth the effort,  if you got money laying around your house / burning a hole in your pocket, i guess you can try this game, but i personally would rather give the money to a charity then pay for any DLC for this Game, or ingame item as the only way to stand ANY chance against other players is BUYING DLC's / ingame items.
1426	0	a	When this game was first released (before being 'Reloaded'), I had really high hopes for this game. The videos of game play and the character creator looked amazing.  But this game fails on every front. The character creator is miserable to use, the interface lags and sometimes glitches, and the models are of the poorest texture quality. In fact, it was so miserable trying to make a character, that I quit and uninstalled the game before I ever got into the world.  Only GTA5 has a worse character creator. (But everything ELSE about that game at least makes up for it.)  It's free, so if you doubt me, go ahead and try it. The only thing you have to lose is your time.
1427	0	a	This game just will not behave. I made an account before I downlaoded it, launched it and logged on useing the account I made. Then it said it was invalid, so I made another account, and THAT did not work, then a third, and months later I downloaded it again, useing all three acounts to login with, and all of them were invalid. It is still like that, and I did not get an email for my roblem yet when I sent in a report, so I do not reccomend this game...
1428	0	a	full of cheaters
1429	0	a	This game isn't dead yet?  Is it completely funded by hackers now?
1430	0	a	Its been a year since ive played this game. I installed the game wondering why I stopped in the first place. I instantly realized why I stopped playing it.   -Constantly micro-freezing on a computer better than the one I originally played it on in the past with no issues.  -Toxic community of hateful wads of sh!t.  -P2W system of weapons and skills.  -Hacking around every corner.  -Constantly being reminded by the game to buy things with real money, also opens up the marketplace for the game on start up, really subtle.  -Completely broken matchmaking system where brand new players are set up against seasoned veterans of the game.  -Hit detection is non-existent.  -You 'rent' weapons unless you cough up about $15-$70.  -And overall one of the worst experiences ive had with multiplayer games. ever.   and they somehow managed to make the game even worse over the course of 2 and a half years on top of having already been a steaming pile of crap after leaving the initial membership model of the original company.   We need an APB out on this game's current developers. Be sure to send the San Paro PD, with their OPGLs.

1433	0	a	APB:RELOADED is the BEST GAME EVER.. For the spoiled children and Trolls. For the people who VALUE their time,it's a game that makes you nothing but mad.
1434	0	a	Reloaded Productions put themselves i.e. ca$h over the community, don't bother.
1435	0	a	i'd rather cut my own nipples off while playing a violin made out of raw buttcheek than to play this game. its booty
1436	0	a	Well. It's been about 2 years. Time to try this again.  I can say I am not shocked to find there have been no major non-cosmetic/cash shop expansions. Customization, the games major draw, hasn't seen any much needed enhancement either.  I did not run into any hackers but there are a LOT less people playing the game now.  Matchmaking still sucks and the game plays like a 5 minute edit of the Unreal engine.  My advice remains the same. Play the game if you want but do not pay this company.
1437	0	a	'lol what's a launcher? what's a registry? lol steam thinks you played it while i crahsed lololol' -The Game's Launcher  I wanted to play this game, since I thought it was a free alternitive to GTA V or something like that, so I got it, and installed the assets. When I clicked played, it gave me an error saying that the game could not load itself into the Windows Registry, then it quitted. Then I relaunched it. Stuck at the splash screen. Launched it again, at the launcher, clicked Play, it just quits, Steam does not register it as a crash, but a 'You played a game!' sort of deal. So I just gave up. Hopefully they will fix it.
1438	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game, ever. First of all, the self-claimed free-to-play is worth a big laugh in the face. There will be rental guns, but all of them are too (in-game) expensive. You will have to play like an addict to finally get one sucky ducky gun off the shelf, while those rentals are only around 7 days. Some are 3. You may want to ask if there is any permanent weapon. The answer is yes, but it comes with a price. Big price. The ARMA Marketplace, where people spend real money to get stuff, is a black market. Do you want to spend around 20 bucks for a single permanent but virtual item? If you do, then this game is totally for you. However, getting only one SMG is not enough to survive the gangster world of APB. There are high-tier players who have apparently cashed out on the game, and they'll do anything to put you off with your newly bought SMG. Then, you'll want to spend more money on another weapon. Unfortunately, this is an endless circle. As you buy something, the game will trick you into buying another. Hold on to your wallet, folks. The second problem I have is the gameplay itself. It's not balanced at all. While the bad guys would rob a store any time they want, the cops would have to chase them down if they ever want to get paid. Chasing criminals is the only way cops can make money in the game. I wasn't so surprised to find out that cops were totally outnumbered. The third ugly issue with the game is the players. I'm not saying that these bad eggs are misbehaving kids, but really all they do are bragging about themselves, trolling other players, and generally being rude. Cops are not exceptions. Almost every pro players (a.k.a. money spenders) I see are most of the time intolerable. Oh, not to mention aiming hack, which is the main contributor to fooling you into buying a new weapon. Tips: no weapons nor human skills can beat auto-aim. The only good thing about the game is its customization ability, but barely enough to compensate for the game's cons. All in all, God forbid you play this game.
1439	0	a	This game is a piece of souless garbage. I rather stare a garbage can on a hot day then play this filth. Amen

1443	0	a	I was told once i'm Hacker beacuse i killed some guy with my luck. This game is actually Pay to Win, if you have money. But better don't play it in this status. Not recommended at all.

1445	0	a	I think honestly they should have tried making changes way earlier when they were just starting out, rather than waiting 3 years to try and change anything. The lighting now sucks and the graphics are terribly all over the place. The weapons keep getting rebalanced even when they're in a perfect state, unecessary changes to a lot of things instead of where it actually counts.
1446	0	a	I have played APB for a short time, when I first started playing I got gold my first day, I was having fun, but as soon as you hit high ranked servers, you're dead, the game is no longer fun because you can't kill cheaters, or people who are just too good at the game and should stop playing it.   APB's Customization is the best customization I have ever seen in any game, you can design your car the way you want to, you can put anything on it and it's completely up to you. The character customization is also great, I managed to make my character look exactly like Rambo and had a blast doing it.  APB's Gameplay however is not the worst, and not the best I have seen in a game. It seems they have worked more on the things that don't matter as much as they have on things that do. Certain guns need to not be implemented in the game, I enter a gold server, I always get matched with someone that has a rocket launcher and just uses it the entire match, how many rockets does that dang thing have with ammo? If it stays implemented, you should only get 1 rocket per life, you know how much those things weigh? And why is everything that is completely OP only available to higher ranked players? I'm gold with a Shaw with no Mods on it, and they are gold with ANY GUN THEIR HEART DESIRES WITH MAXED MODS ON IT. And you just can't win, somehow they beat an LMG (Shaw) with a pistol. I don't get it, there are no bullet physics in the game, headshots do not matter, the only skill required is to be a troll and lean back and forth behind a wall until you kill someone.  I loved the game at first, but I have learned to hate the game. I have literally played the game for 5 days now and went from loving it to hating it. APB, if you want more players, change. Change what the community wants you to change.  Will NOT play again. 3/10

1453	0	a	Ugh, so i played this game in 2014 and had around 600+ hrs.. I saw mostly positive review's on the game thought it got better or something, downloaded it, and reminded myself why i removed it from my pc in the first place. ------------------ Game: ------------------ Graphics - Good. Character Customization - Probably the best i've seen. Physics - Bad Car Handling - Fine  ------------------ Is this Game P2W,  ------------------ Yes this game is p2w probably the worst p2w game you will see on the market, people with just a little bit of experience and some money on their mom's credit card will top frag anytime.   ------------------ For those who wan't to buy DLC's or such: ------------------ Don't download anything, the game has too many cheaters its just not worth the money! The game concept is made that you have to buy at least 5 types of weapons to actually be good at the game, having premium gives you at least 3x advantage.  ------------------ For those who say the game is not p2w. ------------------ Many people that leave positive review on the game bought ig weapons and dlc's the players constantly claim that the game is not p2w even though it gives you way more advantage. The game is not skillbased game if you are best player in APB and playing aginst a enemy that is decent with a p2w weapon he will kill you 1000%.   DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! YOU WILL GET ADDICTED AND GO TO THE PART WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY AGINST P2W PLAYERS. JUST NOT WORTH IT! NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!!!      
1454	0	a	The name of this game should be: Pay to Win Reloaded This game is THE definition of Pay to Win. There's next to no content available for anyone who doesn't want to spend money on this pile of trash. The gameplay is completely unfair when fighting morons who spent money on the game. The driving is terrible, the gameplay is slightly less grindy than Destiny, and the environments are bland and boring. The only thing good about this game is the amount of customization possible. You can put anything you want on nearly anything. Put the N word on your shirt, on your car, on your own body as a tattoo, and around the world as a large spraypainted image. Roleplaying as a member of the KKK has never been so easy.
1455	0	a	STAY AWAY!!!!  This game have a really newb hostile community in its core.... **********************************************************************  I have been playing this for about 4 days now. In those 4 days i experienced,  a lot of hostility towards new players from highlevel players.  I was trying to get my wife into the game too, so i went afk for about 15 secs (in a mission) because she needed my help. when i came back to my screen, i had a really hostile whisper from a team mate, because he had seen me stand still.   I ignored it and resumed our mission, now that same guy started to TK me, and when i asked him why he did that i got 'because you are dumb' Again i I ignored him and tried to resume the mission, but he kept TKing me for the rest of the mission.  Now the mission was over and freindly fire went off, the guy started stalking me and yelling stuff about my mothers â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the global voice chat.  Another episode i had, when i joined a mission was another highlevel player, he started whispering me about my in hes opinion sucky weapon choice. I replied that i just took down 2 of the enemy team with my sucky gun.. but i was assured that it was luck.   After a while the same guy is telling us newbs in the team chat that we should â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off the the bronze district and ruin the missions there instead.  Yet another episode was yesterday, when i joined a mission with 3 gold ranked players, all from the same clan (WASP) one of them ran me over with hes car, i asked him why he did that, he replied 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, you dont look where you walk' so when tried to return to the mission objective they all 3 started TKing me, and i was told that they liked to shoot low lvl players, so they ended up hunting me around the map untill the mission was ended.

1473	0	a	One of the most unbalanced games I've ever played, and wasted money on, you have pistols that can out damage assault rifles and sniper rifles and if you want a good weapon you got to buy it with real money the ingame weapons they give you are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and this game has a lot of hackers. I can unload in a person with a good rifle and they won't die they hit me 3 times with a smaller gun or pistol I die. This game could be a lot better if it was balanced better and took better care of hackers. I play a lot of game and I'm fine with not being the best and dying now and then but come on, I even see people on the chat in game say how they are just gonna quit the game. I liked the game untill I kept running into the bs in the gameplay.

1478	0	a	i have played this game for nearly 1000 hours. not on steam but when it was just by itself. i can say without a doubt in my 1000 hours, this game is nothing but hunger for money.  Dont bother playing. Pros - Variety of guns Variety of customisation of vehicles and character Fun in groups  Cons - Horrible customer service by APB Money hungry game No body cares about your opinion Hackers left and right Have your account hacked every few months and for APB customer service not to do anything about it.

1487	0	a	I honestly dislike this game. The game is repetitive and boring. You litterally do one mission in the misson mode. You crash into windows and collect loot too sell for low amounts of money. You shoot others in PvP. You get team-killed in missions, making them only possible when you don't have a group of idiots on you're team. The servers apparently lag. I didn't have the issue, but most people in the game said they did. I only experienced server delay. Press 'A' for a turn, doesn't work until a second later. Sometimes not the best thing. I do not reccomend.

1494	0	a	This is honestly my first serious review... I wrote a review awhile back, but I felt the need to write a serious one cause this game's gotten even worse than before. At the time of the review, I had 111.7 hrs. And I know it's still counting and all, but this game is actually a real piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.   Let's get down and dirty. Pros:  Gameplay is decent  Lots of customization (I spent around 60 hours just trying to customize my crap so I looked sugoi as f*ck),  Absolutely and ridiculously fun with friends. (Honestly, and thing is fun with friends... I have no friends. this is a lie.)  Cons: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Company â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ optimization â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hackers â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ b*llshit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ servers â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Anti-cheat (One review said False ban for hack? Like ffs) â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Service (Automated replies. No help at all.)  I'm for sure gonna keep playing this game, cause I freaking love the customizations in it, but I really recommend you stay as far away from this game as possible. You gotta work for the money, and working for the money is complete hell because of all those cons up there.  TL:DR This game should literally kill itself.

1504	0	a	I'm going to tell honestly my opinion about this game . First at all i start with the bad side of this game which would be the really awful community . People take the game way to serious , a lot of bad words are getting used in the District chat, really mean people who just search for conflicts and fights. For me the community in online games matters a lot so here i can give APB between 1-10 a fair 3 and only because i met a few nice people otherwise it would be unfair.  Well from the community i can mention the 'cheaters' in this game. If you have really bad nerves then i wouldn't suggest you to play APB simply because there are really a lot of cheaters and yes im not in a position to claim half of the high rank people are using cheats but from a website called fairfight you can make your own image about the amount of hackers in this game .  So now we have a bad Community and lots of cheaters (everyday just imagine it lulz ) and we need help from the owners of this game ...Gamersfirst . So you want another reason why i don't suggest you the game? Here we go ;D  This game belongs to a company that a lot of ' normal ' people in APB hate simply because Gamersfirst doesn't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the players. If you have problems or a request you send them a email and get as usual a auto-message . It often takes way to long to get a response and you kinda have to spam(?) them till they answer even tho if they do, its just lame answers such as ' we work on it' ,or 'please be patient ' . Mentionable is their promises which they don't keep such as an engine update which was planned to be done long time ago but instead they do now interviews with their staff members , kewl huh?.  The only thing which i would say is nice in the game is the cuztomisation.. thats all to be honest . You have lots of ways to make clothings , cars and again thats it :D   At all i don't play it much but when i do its only because of my Character , i guess thats just my girlish side .  Try it out and see if you like it or not but be aware of the meanies out there !   Thanks for reading and Bye Bye &lt;3

1510	0	a	No. I rarely write reviews but this was horrible. I'm sure it may have just been me, but this is my opinion. When i launched the game from steam, it came up with a launcher, which is fine, most games have those. they then opened over 15 tabs in my browser telling me to create an account. i did, and then they wouldnt let me mlog in, even when i activated my account. also, This is ver obiously a pay to win game.
1511	0	a	  I tried to like this game, but the many flaws keep holding back what COULD be a good game.  Pros:  1.) The customization is pretty good. 2.) Respectable weapon choice 3.) Interesting concept. 4.) Decent controls.  Cons: 1.) Incredibly short draw distance, which leads to players being invisible until they pop up a few feet in front of you. It makes using the many weapons the game offers incredibly worthless. 2.) Horrible community, oftentimes there are hackers, aimbots, insults and fighting in the game, and due to the friendly fire, you may end up fighting amongst the 'group' more than fighting the enemy.  3.) Zero strategy. Though most of the matches I played, the main tactic for eleminating other players came down to doing 1 of 2 things. A: get in a car and drive right up to your enemy, (since any vehicle makes the player immune to damage) hop out at the last second and 1-2 shot them with your shotgun. or B: use a 'marksman' rifle type weapon.  4.) Level imbalance. As with any RPG-ish game, you'd expect to find some advantage with being a higher level, but run into someone that has an upgraded vehicle, and you'll never be able to take them, or their vehicle out, as it soaks up grenades and sniper rounds left and right. Expect to get killed in almost every fight with someone that has any sort of upgraded gun as the basic weapons don't offer any sort of real protection against the later upgraded weapons.  5.) The game itself, tells you nothing, nor does it allow for any sort of play outside of PvP, not even a decent tutorial to familarize yourself with it's 'complex' gameplay mechanics.   I could go on, and I should, but frankly, this game is not worth wasting your time on. The few problems I mentioned above hold this game back so much, but from what the current condition of the game leads me to believe is, we'll never see any sort of patch, update, or intervention on these issues.
1512	0	a	First things first, this game gave me high blood pressure         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Best of Frankie&nbsp;
1513	0	a	it's really puss like and would not recommend
1514	0	a	LIST OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME WITHIN TWO DAYS OF PLAYING: 1.) Ignored when i ask a question (that i see now as a very simple question to answer... like five words.) 2.) Openly expressed my feelings about only being to customize your car with a max of three shapes and got crucified. 3.) Met a group of four elite players with the same over powered weapon and wearing stockings and big ole baps! 4.) Made the mistake of trying to speak in chat like a normal human being. 5.) Look in chat and always see people yelling 'Hacker!' or 'Wow, nice wall hack!' 6.) AND SO MUCH MORE!  CONS: - The missions are ALL the same. - If you kick butt in the first two parts of a mission you need to win an all or nothing TDM skirmish or you don't get squat! - Friendly fire is ALWAYS on and the criminals and police both look the same (MEGA PENALTY IF TEAM KILL!). - Spawn kills - Poison community - Gave me more anger than joy. - Couldn't ask a friend to play this out of pure respect. - It IS pay to win! For real though! - Your only motivation is more petty trash to customize your character with!  - The game is built around customization yet restricts you to how much you can customize! WTF! - Made me want to kill myself and improved my life 100% when i stopped playing!  PROS: - Customization... rendered useless due to the poopynes of the game!

The creators of this game are looking down on the non-pay2win people and get their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and giggles from watching the major â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ going on. Might as well be able to pay for aimbot and wallhacks while they're at it.
1518	0	a	Other than the crazy detailed charecter creation, this game doesnt have much. It feels like a generic third person shooter, with generic guns and generic cars. Also it is a sandbox but theres no real free roam just group missions making the game pretty boring.
1519	0	a	Waste of my Time  Downloads it  Opens it  Clicks Play Opens Explorer 3 times Errors  Wont open  Re-downloades  Doesnt work   Waste of time

1525	0	a	11/10 i will launch it again
1526	0	a	Words can not describe how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game is. Actually they can:   - horrible netcode - horrible engine - massively P2W, like it is a joke how they jew money out of people - hackers - non-existing matchmaking - real fu.king retar.ed community  Utter trash, don't even bother downloading. Potatoe / 10
1527	0	a	A waste of time and money.....  I played this game originally... Just after it launched as a F2P release. Spent around $35USD to unlock some premium gear.  Took a break for a while due to life intervention, work, work, work, etc.  9 months (and change) later.... The game is crap, driving mechanics are worse than EVER, and the overall gameplay mechanics are utter JUNK!  Keep away from this turd, its stench will just make you vomit all over your keyboard.

1533	0	a	Dont bother downloading it or playing what use to be a decent game has now turned to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and go figuer its G1 (Gamers first) fault. a year 1/2 ago it was 1 out of 100 were hacking (cheating) now its like 1 out of 5 are cheating and the rest of the 4 that arnt eather become cheaters or quit, i quit again. if you want to waste your time cash just buy a hack like everyone else they seem to not care anymore.
1534	0	a	Well where should i start.   1 off i have been off this game for 3 years To come back and be banned with a perma suspended account.   Contacted support Only to get tell to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off And now they ignore every ticket i send in even over a different game.   All and all   Pay to play game Nothing to do with free to play anymore   Support dosent give a damm about the players  Devs Lost theyre passion for the game   BUY THIS DLC TO UNLOCK how about no   Has not changed since i left it   all and all People there are better rpg Games to waste money on   Cheers Junkie
1535	0	a	The game is absolute trash. It's no fun. The only way it keeps players is making them addicted. And making them hope one day they'll get that engine update. You will expect most people that play this game have no friends which you always have to expect. The community is is just horrific and unexplainable. The custimization is to primitive and needs to be improved. The graphics are insanely outdated. The gameplay is repetitive. The weapons don't even make sense.   Don't play this game if you don't want to waste your life. I do not recommend this game at all. It might say I played for only 300 hours. But that was when I got steam. I've played this game for over four years and I regret all of it. There is better games out there. Just steal your mom's credit card and you will get games that have the best they can offer.
1536	0	a	Never, ever, speak with any GM or CM or you will get banned.  Met GM in game who was speedhacking and aimboting Went on highest roof avaliable, switched to auto-camp sniper, started my macro, put it on 45ms. Sniped â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥er out of the world. Happily logged off, after calling him a 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing looser who cant win even with his cool aimbot'. Next day banned for cheats and insults aimed at other players.

1538	0	a	Played this game from back in the Beta days years ago up to now, with a year break just recently.  And after all that Dev time (and $$$) and hours of people playing/complaining - not much of the terrible one sided mission/extremely broken mechanics have been updated/balanced. However the ARMAS market place has had MASSIVE upgrades, and a whole host of overwhelming 'Pay to Win' weapons/skins/stupidity have been added - goes to show where this studios heart lies. No new updates to reduce day 0 complexity for new gamers, no improvment in game modes/group sizes.  It's no surprise that player numbers have decreased a lot since I played last. My only comments are really for the Gamers first platform - DO SOME REAL DATA ANALYTICS. People don't want a few â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ car mods and pointless skins to convert from a free to premium player -- They want a real reason to grind that all important level, unlock that great weapon, make something else available. Account wide pay to win weapons? Fine! no problem, but at minute 1? The freemium model you use might be great for short term conversion - but it will kill your playerbase ---- I told you so.  TL;DR This game has amazing potential in terms of its concept and execution, it's only a matter of time before someone else does it better. Play it and enjoy if you are bored - but don't invest heavily - you will infinitely regret it.
1539	0	a	This game originally failed because of core problems that existed in the game and the complete ineptitude of the developers (when they were Real Time Worlds) to fix or at the very least alleviate these problems.  Now on top of those issues you have an utterly broken cash shop system that will ruin your experience 95% of the time.  To start I should address some of the original problems that plagued the game on it's original releaes, guns were (and still are) terrible to use and the application of modifications does not make that any better. The gunplay feels clunky and the recoil on most weapons make it impossible to hit anything less than 5 feet infront of you. that is unless you use specifc weapons.  Cars are in the same boat as guns, for a cops and robbers MMO, you think they would be able to get the driving down. This is not the case. The car physics are terrible and they don't control that great either.  The mission system is absolute garbage, you can follow through multiple objectives, winning one after another. but if you fail the final one (, you will instantly, ignoring the fact taht you and your side were dominating the opposition;; fail the entire mission (And I find this happens more for the enforcer faction than the criminal faction, in all my time playing). This is further problematic with the addition cash shop weapons.  Now your thinking: Wow, hopefully the new developer and publishers would of picked up this game up and would of tried to fix these issues, which while do not make the game unplayable, do not provide an enjoyable experience for prolonged periods of time.  Well, no. They ignored these issues.  And I haven't even mentioned the games instability, poor performance even with modern hardware. or the failure for the game to completely shut-down once your done playing (One of the processes used in the game will ALWAYS STAY UP).  What they did bring to the game. was one of the worst things they could of done. They added a cash shop for guns, no no, not cosmetics. these guns have an actual performance advantage over other guns that you can actually aquire through gameplay.  These wonderful items provide superior damage, little to no recoil in addition to some other effects they can provide.  This damages the poor mission matchmaking and balancing because if your enemy team has these weapons, and you don't well, your screwed. in laymans terms.  Now to be fair, the new devs have actually added some content in the game with the addition of the 'Chaos district' and in game events. These aren't that great though, they aren't even the quality of the RTW content (Which isn't that great either), and the events are hampered by people rampantly cheating. Which I forgot to mention, is incredibly commonin this game (from outright use of hacks, to exploiting faults with the game or going out of bounds.)  the only positive thing I can say about the game is it's customisation system. and, unfortunately ,that hasn't seen any improvements since release of the ORIGNAL release. There is very little added to customise yourself since then (that that which is added is cash shop items -- go figure.) and while the emblem creator is nice and all that, if you don't have the ability to use it (since you cannot import emblems and pictures, you use geometric shapes to create them) thats just a wasted feature, and you will be dependant on the auction house to find anything you want. Which is ALSO an issue since people find it prudent to sell their crap for stupid huge amounts of money, and you can't filter or search by name of what your looking for. so if you want anything past 'T' for example. be prepared for LE EPIC TROLL FACE MEME XDDD!!! for the next 40 pages.  To sum this up: If your looking for a GTA MMO, this isn't that. go play GTA instead, if your looking for a fun Free-to-Play game, this Definitely isn't for you. becuase this game is by no means 'Free' and it's not fun either. I tried to cover everything I experience in my time playing this game, I probably missed something that would make me go for another 5 paragraphs. so it's best to stop here.  TL;DR: Games â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, p2w garbage. devs don't give a crap about the game and army of cheaters, go play some other game.

1548	0	a	OMG, what a TRASH game....  Hackers... Everyone Hacks, Snap to Target, insta kills, it's pathetic.  This game needs to be removed from steam.
1549	0	a	This Game IS free 2 play, trust me :)
1550	0	a	90% time spent in customization the rest to dieing to pay to wins  Time well spent
1551	0	a	This game is terible, the graphics are not good and laggy and just plain terible. Do not get this game, its worse than farmville and its nothing like GTA
1552	0	a	If you like cops and robber pvp sure this is the game for you. Although, be warned that the damage system is all f*ck up and will only make you say WTF at every gun fight you enter.   Don't waste your time and money on this game, it doesnt worth it.
1553	0	a	It is a pile of wank........ Stop buying in-game guns if you have already and use the money to buy a p*rnhub subscription, Becuase if you have wasted money on in-game guns those are probably the only t*ts you will see for a long while
1554	0	a	5 years later and this game is still garbage.
1555	0	a	This game SUCKS.
1556	0	a	Its a swirling peak of awesome, heavily coated in a foul shell of excrement. I just got through playing wildstar, this game was a brutal reminder of the personal customizaition. You can have everything you want, with a huge investment of time; if you want to speed it up with money, you may. PVP takes up the other half of the game, I really think its never going to be what it should because people refuse to communicate, especially in such an open-world environment; however when they do, the pvp can be amazing. Matchmaking needs a lot of work. i'd give this game a 10, but it's still really rough around the edges, and tbh it probably just needs more funding, give it a C for good effort
1557	0	a	this game used to be fun but now its a game of lag and itiots
1558	0	a	OMG, what a TRASH game....  Hackers... Everyone Hacks, Snap to Target, insta kills, it's pathetic.  This game needs to be removed from steam.

1560	0	a	This game would be really nice if it wasnt pay to win i mean why do i have to pay money for an ingame gun 40$?I can buy better stuff with that
1561	0	a	This is one classic EPIC Pay2Win game with crazy laggy server. If you want to get a nice stroke during playing with your PC, this game is definitly your first choice.
1562	0	a	idk what to put so heres a waffle recipe:  Ingredients:  2 eggs 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 3/4 cups milk 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 tablespoon white sugar 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  Steps:  1.) Preheat waffle iron. Beat eggs in large bowl with hand beater until fluffy. Beat in flour, milk, vegetable oil, sugar, baking powder, salt and vanilla, just until smooth.  2.) Spray preheated waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray. Pour mix onto hot waffle iron. Cook until golden brown. Serve hot. ;)

1573	0	a	the game sucks. it says i played for 1.4 hours. the 1.3 hours was spent creating profiles and installing. i thought the whole idea of steam was to centralize online games for computer gamers?  anyway, i played for 5 minuted and then deleted it.
1574	0	a	Piece of trash pay to win and matches you up with high level â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ faces. 0/10 uninstalled this waste of space, time and effort
1575	0	a	Its a pay to win you have to pay for the fun â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1576	0	a	game wont let me drown myself :c  on a serious note i was doing the tutorial AND i accidently completed things without knowing what i was doing for one second.....0/10 â™¥â™¥â™¥ and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s not worth it
1577	0	a	Sadly I cant recomend this abysmal game to anyone, the screenshots make it look cool, REALLY COOL! but it fails on the worst design choices. The Driving is worse then Alone in the Dark (2008) im not kidding, and the Shooting is so hard to get a good shot, all this due to the DAMN CONTROLS BEING MORE UNRESPONSIVE THEN SHAQ FU ON THE SNES!   DONT BUY THIS SH**TY EXCUSE FOR A GAME, PLEASE DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS I DID!
1578	0	a	POSITIVE: Honestly digged this game and was addicted like crazy. reminds me of saints row but with a faction between bountyhunters and criminals. Game itself has some really awsome customization! you can spend hrs customizing your car/clothes/guns/music/spray tags/ and more! as a criminal you can mug people and break into stores and sell them for goods. as a bounty hunter you can pretty much go cat and mouse with the crims.  NEGATIVE: now that ive said how i first felt about the game and still do a little lemme explain a little about how they need to fix the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t that actually makes you want to rage quit. first of all the tutorials SUCK! goodluck finding out how to do anything in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game unless you actually look it up on the internet or you have a friend on APB.   Next is the weapon and perk system. ok wtf. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing no way in hell can my character beat anyone whos been playing this game for months/years and they already have almost every damn perk in the game. and if its not the perks its the weapons. People brag constantly how much they spend actual money on the game just so they can kill you in 2-3 shots without using a sniper. oh and not to mention the HACKERS!!! its soo â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing frustating!!!  i wanted to enjoy this damn game but theres no way i can play it when i either have to pay actual money to stay alive, or take constant losing for about 5 months until i can actually unlock powerful equipment! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that! There needs to be some kind of lvl measurment. oh wait! there is!   Threat level (trainee - bronze - silver - gold) which requires you to be stuck on certain servers to fit your gameplay rating. but if someone were to just constantly lose from gold and become silver and then silver to bronze or to have a group member whos bronze. then guess what. YOU ARE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ED! as a trainee i fought countless golds and silvers and got my â™¥â™¥â™¥ handed to me for days. heck weeks! and i kept getting mad at myself for not being good enough... until i finally realized it wasn't me, it was the game itself that no matter what strategy i did or used, if i wasn't properly equiped, i might as well shove my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in a blender because theres no way im â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing anytime soon. lol.  CONCLUSION: I played for like about a good month until my gf and i killed eachother out of frustration, havn't played it since.  -The End
1579	0	a	Holy crap. What did I expect in this game? A hell of a lot more. A hell of a lot more... I expected more GTA-like aspects/mechanics, but that's just detail. No, what I truly expected was more free stuff. This game boasts Free 2 Play, and yet it cannot guarantee it. Just another â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ MMO game with a rental system. Remember Combat Arms? Well, that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ deserved to get haxxor'd. All this renting nonsense and stuff like that... WHAT? At the very least make us WORK for the items. But nope, the developers of this game decided to create another one of THOSE games, which require us players to throw money at them every so often. Do not play this unless you really enjoy paying people for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ products.
1580	0	a	This is a purely pay to win game with an abundance of hackers and cheaters due to the ancient pre gears of war 1 engine its running on, the lack of xbox 360 controller support is sad. The engine is that porly optimised that many people complain of 'lag' due to the low en or mid range hardware that can handle other games but not this game. the game also lacks support for a modern directx or proper anti cheat, punk buster does not cut it people by pass it. in my opnion the 'engine upgrade they keep tossing around should remove the cheaters for a while untille the find new hacks and exploits. the main thing that kills the game for me is the lack of aussie servers and the extremly expensive guns on armas which are cheape for most people in europe and america who play. the thrill of kedding killed by some one with a permant op gun and premum membership + thier hacks is not a fun thing. plus the game gets repetative after a while the driving mechanics and the game physics are total rubbish. there is a desctingt lack of 3d postional audio, there are no 5.1 and 7.1 surrond sound options under audio settings this is terrible. my advice wait un till this so called engine update is relased before playing.
1581	0	a	'BE ALL YOU CAN'T BE' i'mm guessing thats all â€ appY wanted before you banned his account, don't even bother pressing the download button on this one, i played it and even with my low hours i know that in hte trailers they show you cool â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but hey, you can do that|! if you feed them a thousand dollars you could've bought something better with , payday 2 (-_-) , gta v a proper online open world skirmish where guess what , DLC IS FREE and the only payable thing for is money which you could easily earn in about 30 mins. my verdict they empty your pocket then give you an â™¥â™¥â™¥ bronzing , this is just a massive kick up the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for people trying to play a 'free to play' something this falls short of being.
1582	0	a	For 2 years now since i play this game, The only thing that impress me is the character customisation, other than that is all crap. You need to pay for cloths, bonus, and the thing is those premium weapon are much OP. This game is a pay to win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!
1583	0	a	dont spend money on this game , its worthless :3 , trust me u wasting ur money ................ i m doing this for the good of human man-kind

1586	0	a	Pathetic.  EDIT:  Wasted 6 years of my life on this sad excuse we call a game.
1587	0	a	Ruled by hackers, laggy and Pay2Win, need I say more?
1588	0	a	Pay to win up the â™¥â™¥â™¥. Community is filled with furâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and ERP cancer. Mods have no clue about what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ they're doing. Hackers on a daily basis.  10/10, it's okay.
1589	0	a	If you like cops and robber pvp sure this is the game for you. Although, be warned that the damage system is all f*ck up and will only make you say WTF at every gun fight you enter.   Don't waste your time and money on this game, it doesnt worth it.
1590	0	a	Spent 2 hours, editing my car, would have been more time wasted, if I didn't attempted to save my car. Realised that there was too many decals, because I had a 'free account', didn't let me save it. Mediocre gameplay, shiÑ‚Ñ‚y guidelines and rules. Do me a favor and never play this shiÑ‚, don't even eyeball it, what ever you're looking for, in the Steam Store, this isn't it.
1591	0	a	Fun for a couple hours, but quickly becomes nothing but stressful.   Extremely toxic community. Less than lethal weapons used by enforcers are stressful as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to use and essentially useless unless you have sunk hundreds of hours into the game. Seems like 50-60% of the community uses snipers, so you just get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sniped over and over. Driving controls are absolutely miserable unless you invest a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing TON of time to get a nice car, or get a pay to win car. Overall, it's just sort of pointless. There's no reason to take your rank seriously, there's no reason to give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the game. it's primarily a small community of veteran players and if you are new, it is impossible to get into it.   If you just want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around in it with friends for a bit, go ahead. Otherwise steer clear. If you own it, just play GTAV. 
1592	0	a	suck my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1593	0	a	A game acting like its GTA 5, don't get it.
1594	0	a	4/10
1595	0	a	no, DON'T! Please don't waste your time playing this game. This game is crap, not much people in servers and lots of servers have hackers or annoying players. Gameplay used to be fun and this game had good potential. Not anymore. This game is horrible. Don't spend a cent on their crappy DLC too!   I will leave by giving a nice gift to the developers:   .â€¦â€¦..â€¦../Â´?/)â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..(\?`\ â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦/â€¦.//â€¦â€¦â€¦.. â€¦\â€¦.\ â€¦â€¦â€¦../â€¦.//â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ â€¦.\â€¦.\ â€¦../Â´?/â€¦./Â´?\â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦../? `\â€¦.\?`\ .././â€¦/â€¦./â€¦./.|_â€¦â€¦_| .\â€¦.\â€¦.\â€¦..\ (.(â€¦.(â€¦.(â€¦./.)..)â€¦..(..(. \â€¦.)â€¦.)â€¦.).) .\â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.\/â€¦/â€¦....\/â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦./ ..\â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.. /â€¦â€¦..\â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦/ â€¦.\â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..(â€¦â€¦â€¦..)â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦/ there, happy?
1596	0	a	THIS GAME IS STILL A BROKEN PIECE OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1597	0	a	It's bad.  Thats all i have to say.  The only thiing that is good is the art but besides that everything else is bad.
1598	0	a	This game is terrible and get worse by the day. After firing the dev team and promising to be better, Publisher GamerFirst took a few steps backwards. The servers promised never arrived. Server downtimes increased and all the way around, worst communit ever. Good luck and God have mercy on your sould you choose to play this game.
1599	0	a	pay 2 win but its fun somtimes unless the people you verse have there moms credit cards as weapons
1600	0	a	Just get any Saints row or GTA game, its better then APB in everyway, don't get me started on the hit detection.
1601	0	a	No anti-cheat system, Unfair matchmaking, Limited weapon use.  Want a better game than this? play GTA V.
1602	0	a	Pay to win up the â™¥â™¥â™¥. Community is filled with furâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and ERP cancer. Mods have no clue about what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ they're doing. Hackers on a daily basis.  10/10, it's okay.
1603	0	a	Fairfight is broken, hackers out the â™¥â™¥â™¥, and complete pay to win scheme. ARMAS Marketplace is worse than EA, Ubisoft, any of them. That's why no one knows about them, because they're so damn terrible.
1604	0	a	If you spend enough money you can get guns that 1-3 hit kill where all non money purchaseable guns are balanced by themselves. It's Pay to Win, do not play unless you like that sort of thing
1605	0	a	This, my friend, is the worst game in the planet. I installed this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, got fps drops af with a gtx 1070 and i5 6600, after that killed a team mate, because i was noob af. Then got some weird internet problem (im pretty sure it wasn't a kick, at least it wasn't saying anything like 'You got kicked blablabla')  Meanwhile i was talking with ma bois without any lag.  So i decided to uninstall!  Hope you had a good time reading this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, but serious just buy GTA!
1606	0	a	JUST READ IT BEFORE YOU PLAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOU FROM A MENTAL BREAKDOWN  F UCK.THIS.S HIT. DONT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU VALVUE YOUR SANITY.At first this game was awesome alright, having fun doing good stacking up the g's. Now my first thing i want to say is that there is A F UCKING R ETARDED GLITCH where when you buy a gun it will charge you for it 2-4 times losing the money you just spend 6 hourss working for. Next complain. ALOT OF THE PEOPLE, mostly the criminals, WHO PLAY THIS GAME ARE F UCKING D IPSHIT A SSHOLES WHO FEEL THE NEED TO OVERCOMPENSATE FOR THER F UCKING MICRO P ENIS'. When your trying to earn chash,the point of the game, you'll have people who decive you, say they will help you and right before you are about to get money they will f ucking r ape you and give you their F UCKING AIDS so that you die and they can steal your money. Next, when your in a van your IMMEDEA TELY F UCKED; having a van basically says 'hey im transporting a s hit load of money come and f ucking get it you c unts'. Now that will trigger all the squeakers around you and they will immedeatly flock to your a sshole trying to wait for you to get out of your van to steal your it, the f ucked up thing is that you need to leave the van to stat making the money, not going to explain ho because it will take too long. Just image the scene from finding nemo with the seagulls, great now replace them with R ETARDED 7 YEAR OLDS. Ok, my final point is that one of the easiest ways to make money is ram raiding which is what i have been talking about mostly, when you have been sweating your a sshole off for the past century to the point where it's dicintegrating your gonna have a nice fat stack of chash available in the back of your van. When/If you get to turn this in with out the f uckboy's around stalking you. Your gonna be on the map if you have above 2.5k dollars. When you've been working THAT F UCKING LONG AND THAT F UCKING HARD AND YOU GET IMMEDEATLY F UCKED IN THE A SS AND YOUR MONEYS BEEN STOLEN YOUR SOUL GETS SUCKED OUT OF YOUR A SS AND YOU WASTE 30 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE JUST LIKE ME WRITING A RAGE REVIEW ON STEAM BECAUSE ANGER IF THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE. And so concludes my review/essay on why never the play this CANCER GAME.

1614	0	a	Why cant i play it?
1615	0	a	This game has a lot of good ideas, but it also has a lot of bad ones. To keep it as short and simple as possible, this game is very unforgiving, especially to newer players. Prepare to spend several hundred hours competing against max level gold ranks with pay 2 win guns who are organized, probably with voice comms. After you manage to learn to cope with that (assuming you don't quit first) you might ascend to the point of being capable of enjoying this game.   Or just play another shooter.
1616	0	a	waaaaaaayyy to unbalenced if you're even a fairly new player you have no hope of living once an enforcer or a long time player sets their sights on you due to unbalenced everything and enforcers are just waaay to over powered i mean seriously? they can just handcuff you then you can't do ANYTHING????? this is the reason i have a different computer now cause i smashed my laptop after getting arrested for the 7th or 8th time for no legit reason :/.... 0.01 outta ten

1627	0	a	Get a life and buy GTA 5!

1629	0	a	This game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!  actualy -'the'  this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1630	0	a	it doesnt load and it crashs alot
1631	0	a	While it has been like two or three years since I last played, the only thing I can remember is that it had some severe pay to win going on. There were a lot of things you had to pay for actually, if not for that then it would be a really fun, cool game.
1632	0	a	This game, is pretty great. 'Why the thumbs down then?' Hold up. Im getting there. So I heard about this game from a friend and it was free so I was like, hey its free so why not? Well it was pretty awesome at first. Then I actually got into the game, and it was SO. VERY. LAGGY. I don't know if its just me, but it was REALLY, REALLY laggy. Though, when I did get to play it with minimal lag, it was pretty great. Though the missions tended to get a bit repetative. Other than that gamebreaking lag it was great.
1633	0	a	i do not recommend the game. i have payed it a few times before but always ran into some kind of issue. this time my char that was saved in the system wont load and it kicks me. when i try to make a new one i cant get past making a name and choosing a server. waste of time.
1634	0	a	1/10 would never play again
1635	0	a	If I could go back to time I'd save myself from installing this game.
1636	0	a	The only upside i got to mug the easter bunny.
1637	0	a	You know a game is bad when you press the 'start' button and it just sends you to a Facebook page to leave a 'like'.
1638	0	a	It's horrible
1639	0	a	Its lazy, boring, driving controls are just... no
1640	0	a	I used to love this game. It was a 'cheap' GTAV. I was thrilled, I could play a game just like GTAV for free!  It's never that simple.  I spent around 200 dollars on in-game items. It would of been cheaper just to buy GTAV.  There's a reason 'hacking' is a popular tag for this game. Also, there's some odd obsession with naked anime girls here. Not that that's a bad thing.

Unless you got some mates willing to help you out that are NOT newb players cause when a game got you struggling on the tutorial by yourself you won't be gettin far.

1643	0	a	This Game IS free 2 play, trust me :)
1644	0	a	This is one classic EPIC Pay2Win game with crazy laggy server. If you want to get a nice stroke during playing with your PC, this game is definitly your first choice.

1649	0	a	Like GTA, except really really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1650	0	a	It is a pile of wank........ Stop buying in-game guns if you have already and use the money to buy a p*rnhub subscription, Becuase if you have wasted money on in-game guns those are probably the only t*ts you will see for a long while
1651	0	a	A really awesome concept, but just done really bad. Its still fun to play, but if you want to do actual missions and stuff then you will have to atleast pay a dollar to get a gun that DOESN'T to the equivalent damage of shooting paper clips covered in feathers at people.  However, I will say that the overall customization of everything is the best I have seen in a LONG time.
1652	0	a	If you spend enough money you can get guns that 1-3 hit kill where all non money purchaseable guns are balanced by themselves. It's Pay to Win, do not play unless you like that sort of thing

1655	0	a	nice game but bad graphics...
1656	0	a	I desperately wanted to like this...and then couldn't.
1657	0	a	field field field warnning dont play this game if you dont want to kill youre self and always be angry this game is full of cheaters 60% of this game using cheates because all of them can make a fake account with 10min emails and use their cheates without gamersfrist ban they real accounts this game dont have any ip ban so if someone use cheates and anti cheate ban him he can make a new acc and use their cheates.  its one of many problems of this game other is: 1:this game have fps problem in the battels youre fps randomly go 10 from 90 im playing bf4 but i dont have fps prbolem so my pc is so good but i have fps drops on this game. 2:this game was not a p2w game in 3 years ago i played this game but now mrs tiggs make this game a full p2w game with many p2w weapons cars and perimums. but immportant is so many cheaters is already playing on this game this game have only one anti cheate and that is fairfight but they cant find any cheaters agin:D so i really dont reacommend this game for you guys i think soon this game lose all their players and everyone can see servers empty
1658	0	a	THE GAME WAS HORRIBLE IT WAS A DISCRACE TO ALL GAMES AND IS ANOTHER RIP OFF OF GTA
1659	0	a	how can this lag......
1660	0	a	ShÂitty servers. P2W. Just get a sub @  www.artiÂfiÂciaÂlaiÂming.net  and rage all day long, that's the only use of this game until they fix it.
1661	0	a	Don't waste your time on this game
1662	0	a	Gunplay is clunky 500trillion% p2w gets boring after 0.25 seconds This game made me chop my balls off and kms 10/10 
1663	0	a	Game is RUINED. The new company with zero management skills took EVERYTHING away from older players (mainly the game itself) and made it easier and more appealing to ignorant and obnoxious 13 year old callofdutyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, animeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, bronyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and potheads who use their mommy's credit card to buy a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing $10 GUN in a game so they can grief the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of everyone else that use to enjoy it and other than that they have nothing else better to do than hump eachother's female avatars while they listen to gay japanese music, who have now OVERUN the game. Any comments or complaints of their eratic behaviors are met with fierce opposition from almost the ENTIRE community. This is coming from a day one beta player with 100+ hours and if you don't believe me, DON'T try it for yourself.
1664	0	a	Unique game and playstyle, weapons are great, systems and everything about this game is amazing in it's own right, including the asylum and baylift, especially the clothes, vehicle, character, etc customization. Although many problems do exist with this game such as including the matchmaking system. One other problem although I know of this game is that steam registers it as open even when it has been fully closed for hours, unallowing you to close steam without the task manager. All in all though it is a great game besides some capatability bugs with steam. You got glitched galore in the maps and everywhere else. This game when you look for problems, you find them. You have kids with rocket launchers surfing card and firing away at you. Missions are onesided and heres the big one.....ANY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IN A GARBAGE TRUCK CAN RUN OVER YOUR CAR, CARS AROUND YOU AND EVERYTHIGN ELSE RAMMING IT AND DESTROYING IT ALL OUTSIDE OF ANY MISSION SO YOU CAN NOT HARD THEM TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.....and it's quite annoying I do say.... also you need 400+ hours in the game to even have a chance at taking on veteran players who log hours. combat is screwed up with hit registers due to when you shoot depends on when the server is pinging, everything having a small noticable delay

1666	0	a	dont spend time on that game. full of hackers. anti cheat ban you when you get over 50 reports. this game fall into a wrong hands (GamersFirst)
1667	0	a	the game sucks. it says i played for 1.4 hours. the 1.3 hours was spent creating profiles and installing. i thought the whole idea of steam was to centralize online games for computer gamers?  anyway, i played for 5 minuted and then deleted it.
1668	0	a	This is stupid and doesn't work. After downloading the game I clicked 'Play' and it takes me to this pop-up window. I just suspected the game was downloading in that window because there was a loading thing, and when it finished I clicked continue. THEN it takes me to another pop-up saying 'Like us on facebook for free new items!' I finally went to the official site (Which I shouldn't have to, seen as how I downloaded this from Steam) and even their site was useless. DO NOT download this because there is no game to play on this.

1674	0	a	My first impression of the game was filled with annoyance and hate. Walked around enjoying the wonderful city, it was great. Seeing tons of people run around was nice. Then when i start or attempth to start a mission, thats when things got from nice to extremely bad. I was going to mission points like normal, thinking what rewards id get finishing it. Then i died cause some idiot sniped me for no reason, i say ok. Then as i attempth to do the mission again. Someone runs me over with an ambulance, thinking it might just be bored players i waitted for a day or two. Then when i try the mission again dead, this pattern repeated itself none stop. So... I uninstalled the game and said 'Yup, i'm done with this.' so i quit the game.   APB gets a final score of 0.5/10   (Should have a lower score, but i enjoyed what little there is the game has to offer but expirience wise. I didn't enjoy it one bit, too many people killing you. No PvE mechanics, seems to cater to the people that just kills new players for no reason, and this is why it gets this score.)  The graphics is fairly decent, nothing over the top eyecandy. Sound is so-so, and gets boring. Gameplay is extremely bad to extremely poor (Too many Annoying people.)  This game is only for those people with no respect for other peoples prefference of playing nice and slow. Casual players avoid this game, go play something else.  Peace. 0 Comments Subscribe to thread (?)
1675	0	a	I don't think I've ever seen a worse MMO and that's my opinion before I even get into the game. When I downloaded it the game complained it didn't know my video card and crashed. Then once I repaired the install it worked fine until I actually launched it and it's running in 800x600 with no way to change it until after character creation. Too much effort to just get in game.  in short, avoid like the plague. There's a reason the game developers went bust.
1676	0	a	my buddy ol pal keeps â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing asking me to play..... i dont like this game
1677	0	a	I was banned from this game a couple years ago for hacking. They put my username on a board of shame and everything. I forgot about it, but then a couple days ago, the people who run this game saw fit to remind me about the incident. They sent me an email saying they know I hacked, but that their willing to give me a second chance. Well guess what, I know I didn't hack, it was just your anti-cheat software banning me for a false positive detection. Here's hoping you've fixed that in the years since, and that you can convince people to try your game after they read reviews like this. I won't be giving you the second chance.
1678	0	a	So I found this game maybe in 2011. I played it first as criminal, didnt like it, changed to cop. Crminals are easy money faction, because you can ram with stolen van on store, get the stuff, sell them and change money to clean ones. Cops are also very fun because you can 'chase' random ppl for nothing sirens on to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them off. (Ramming included) Now let's get to + and - parts  Pros +Character customization and car customization totally in in-game money (easy to get too) +You can look like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and be a cop at same time. +A lot of emblems to create for your character and some people can make amazing ones. +Trolling as cop Cons -PunkBuster, I call it PunkCluster. -Those who pay, gain TOTALLY OVERPOWERED advantage with their premium shottys. (Not much of those though on lvl1) -Very limited amount of character custom clothes if not paying. -On level 50 (like me) I got sniper (kills in 2 shots) shoot a guy 2 times, he teleports and kills me from 200 m with premiumshotty. -Servers sometimes really laggy and disconnecting.  So why I said no? Well I like this game a lot and REALLY recommend it for you, why not, its free, but personally, after 4 years, having 5 month pauses, I don't enjoy it. That's why. But that doesn't mean YOU don't enjoy it, I'm not here to say 'You can play this, you can't play this', i'm here to give my opinion. Thanks.
1679	0	a	Unique game and playstyle, weapons are great, systems and everything about this game is amazing in it's own right, including the asylum and baylift, especially the clothes, vehicle, character, etc customization. Although many problems do exist with this game such as including the matchmaking system. One other problem although I know of this game is that steam registers it as open even when it has been fully closed for hours, unallowing you to close steam without the task manager. All in all though it is a great game besides some capatability bugs with steam. You got glitched galore in the maps and everywhere else. This game when you look for problems, you find them. You have kids with rocket launchers surfing card and firing away at you. Missions are onesided and heres the big one.....ANY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IN A GARBAGE TRUCK CAN RUN OVER YOUR CAR, CARS AROUND YOU AND EVERYTHIGN ELSE RAMMING IT AND DESTROYING IT ALL OUTSIDE OF ANY MISSION SO YOU CAN NOT HARD THEM TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.....and it's quite annoying I do say.... also you need 400+ hours in the game to even have a chance at taking on veteran players who log hours. combat is screwed up with hit registers due to when you shoot depends on when the server is pinging, everything having a small noticable delay
1680	0	a	  Not worth it at all....  You literally cant enjoy this game without spending a ton of money
1681	0	a	Was better on Real Time Worlds back in 2009 it wasnt pay2win back than too
1682	0	a	Don't even bother.
1683	0	a	There was a time when APB was good. Until they let cheaters to do their dirty work. now its APB-ReCheaterLoad
1684	0	a	kinnda like gta but with more customization
1685	0	a	The thing i hate in this game is that I'm getting killed all the time by Pay to Win players. It makes game unplayable.
1686	0	a	GTA 4 wannabe game without the polish- effectively just a turd. There litterally is no purpose in the game, microtransactions. Not worth the 10$ in bandwidth to download it!
1687	0	a	another game where the launcher has fallen to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 10/10 if it whould let me launch it aagain.
1688	0	a	piece of crap in my opinion
1689	0	a	Good game but horrific lag if your'e trying to play from AUSTRALIA. unable to drive with so much lag and you dont stand a chance too much LAGGGGGGGGGG
1690	0	a	This game is just bad. I took my time and gave it a fair play imo.  I guess if you like playing dress-up this game is for you.  The whole game is a Con and the only PRO you will hear is...Well you can change the color of your T-shirt,etc.  Boring world with the same missions on repeat. It is like being stuck in a smaller(much smaller GTA title.) with bad hitbox detection or flat out lag or something.No clue but this game can run on a toaster from 2005.  Cops and Crims. If it was as big as planetside 2,or gta v i'd play it again. But all these small scale fps war games suck and are flat out boring and a pain to play.  I am not going to list the bad things as imo the whole thing is utter garbage.
1691	0	a	Unless you like people that are literal bullet sponges, don't play. Its 3rd person call of duty with a not so GTA twist. Save your hardrive space.
1692	0	a	Yea FAIRFIGHT whoooooooooooooooooooooooooo (Lets instal this antiCHEAT in all games) Redy BEND OVER get fuc c===3 ked HARD U have 2 options: 1) HACKERS ; 2) P2W players
1693	0	a	This game is a half baked GTA clone. The worlds are tiny and for some reason everyone is a scenester. The physics are and GUI make this game look like it was made in the early 00's.   2/10 would not recomend.
1694	0	a	So I installed the game, then updated it, and then got prompted to create a 'gamersfirst account' in addition to my steam account to play this game. No thanks. You have this game on steam, so let me play it on steam, thank you very much.   Oh and by the way, if your game needs 47 minutes to update after you've installed on steam already, you're doing something wrong.   And the intro screen already lagged around. Just saying.
1695	0	a	Game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! Always has been. Always will be.
1696	0	a	We seriously need to delete this one from our memory.
1697	0	a	The driving is sad....got me just confused when i entered it bc i had no clue on what to due and i keep getting spawned killed
1698	0	a	can log on
1699	0	a	After my limited time playing this game, I could give you a pretty decent and detailed review. This game doesn't deserve one. Simply: Don't play this game. The devs are greedy, the players are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, the gameplay is terribly boring, the game is just a downright frustrating grind and nothing else, all in all, only good thing about this game? You get to design things. Oh, did I tell you that you have to unlock the decals to design with? Or you could.. *Cough* pay real money for them *Cough*  Keep away from this one, it's a waste of time.
1700	0	a	This game has a great potential to be a fun little distraction, when having flashlights and lasers shone into your eyes is too 'realistic' for you, or when WoW is too 'click-to-win' for your taste.  Mixing MMO and TPS in a pretty strange mix, the action, customization, and open world feel you can find in this game have impressed me. For a free to play, pay to win game it turned out to be rather enjoyable even without transactions.  However, the only reason I can NOT recommend trying this game, is its match making system. You, as a new player, must not only understand your chosen role, criminal or enforcer, but also your role as fodder. The match maker feeds you to higher levels quite readily, and to make sure you, as the fodder, can't leave the trough it drops you into, you are not permitted to leave a mission once you've been pulled into it.  Feeding higher ranks isn't avoidable. You have cheap guns and no armor, they have very powerful guns and armor that grants them greater health than you. In a CQC fight between yourself, wielding an SMG made for CQC, and a high level enemy, wielding a high power rifle made for sniping, the higher level will win due to the fact their armor soaks your bullets, and your lack of armor doesn't soak their far stronger bullets.  Ultimately, the choice you must decide on before you pick up this game is this: Do you want to be a feeder, or do you want to be a competitor? If you chose the latter, hit the back button on the store browser and find another free game.
1701	0	a	The game started out fun, but getting deeper into it, you begin to see the inconsistencies of what it claims to be, and what it actually is. There's no denying how awesomely customizable everything is in the game, down to character creation, outfits, vehicles, what have you. The problem I ran into, is the overwhelming number of people hacking the game, prolonging their own lives and auto-aiming. Once you put two and two together, you realize you're only one of a handful of legitimate players, competing against a troupe of people who just wanna be successful in a video game, even if it means cheating. I'd check this off your list, because there's no rescue coming.
1702	0	a	$20 says that when this game stops making money, we'll start to see a LOT of changes that should've been added, such as: -SIMPLE weapon balancing -A much more alive city -Cheater enorcement -More FREE customization options -LESS P2W features -Better Hit Detection -Loads of apolagies from the devs for being negligent re-re's
1703	0	a	if you play this game and waste money on it your the most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ person ever . in this you can camp roofs and shoot noobs drive a car have SUPER LAG!. its really bad and the servers are hosted from the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing moon.
1704	0	a	You know why.
1705	0	a	I am not intrested in games with just pvp all the time and the players are hackers and jerks so i do not recommend this game at all.
1706	0	a	APB in all is a very fun game but on bronze and silver servers there are always gold players and it ends up being difficult to play. also they are a very high number of hackers on this game

1731	0	a	Bad. Boring, unbalanced, unoriginal, ugly, lazy, I cannot stress how bad this game is. Server problems aside, this is just, one of the WORST games, no wait, one of the worst FREE games, of all time. It's confusing, there's just about no tutorials to be found, the story is missing, the character creation is pretty lame. There is NO PVE, which wouldn't be a problem if the game wasn't P2W. There is nothing good to be found here, this beats big rigs, this game actually tried really hard to be good, and failed. The only reason it gets a 2, is because it's playable, not that you'd want to play it though. 2/10.
1732	0	a	Too many â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s be stupid spending their hard-earned money just to make â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing new players hate this motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game, I mean seriously, GET YOUR LIVES OUT OF YOUR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ASSES! Too many premium players are bullying newcomers, all games SHOULD HAVE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING balance on your matchmaking and not let premium guns get SO OVER-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING-POWERED. I hate when these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s just bully and pick on people to make them rage. I think it is unethical and just plain annoying, that's all I have to say.

1748	0	a	A complete waste of time. This game is literally the worst MMO to date... This is why Realtime Worlds went out of business and the free version is no different. Don't even download it, because it is full of people who buy guns (with REAL money) and being a new player really takes the fun out of it because people will just snipe you from across the map and have one-hit kill weapons. Stay away from this piece of crap game.
1749	0	a	This is a good game but sadly poorly executed first off the cars handle HORRIBLEY youll be slipping and sliding everywhere also the guns you start out with are crap you will ALWAYS find your self out gunned against other players and the pay isnt good either my vederict is just buy gta 5 that game is good and much better than this
1750	0	a	Game is terrible , I forgot what Ragequitting was until I played this game .Matchmaking is beyond broken ,the missions in this game are repititive and dumb as Sh*t(Vip Missions).This game gets updated frequently and yet 4 years later still running into the same problems.If 'Gamer'sFirst' Couldn't fix it 4 years back they sure as hell can't fix it now.   Bottom Line I DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone.
1751	0	a	This game is purely pay to win... nothing else to say

1754	0	a	As of July 2015 APB Reloaded is dead or very close. Matchmaking is near impossible as there is nobody to play with, at least on the gold servers which is annoying, most everyone only hangs out in the neutral district now :(
1755	0	a	Unfortunately an excellent idea for a multiplayer open world 3rd person shooter is handicapped by inherent game features that frustrate and annoy me beyond what I'm willing to tolerate. Not recommended.
1756	0	a	This game is a play for free, pay to win. There for it is terrible this game wants to be gta online but has terrible realism and pyshics. Also in this game as it is openworld pvp if you shoot someone they will not die, even if the gun is 50 calibre it will take more than 15 bullets. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
1757	0	a	wasted a minute and a half of my life downloading this game, to waste another 20 minutes getting the game to even start, to waste another 30 minutes trying to figure out why i had a blank black screen but could still hear the game sound, to finally waste another minute in a half figuring out that this game is not windows 10 compatible.....

1776	0	a	Fun untill you loose Premium ;_;  Im not paying for that.
1777	0	a	great consept, terrebly exicuted
1778	0	a	This game is fun, I'll give them that. It's like an F2P GTA with no real way to go. I played this game a lot, even though I only have 5.9 hours, reason being, I left the game for awhile. I didn't play for a real long time and I just played other games, which is okay, but when I tried to come back, BOOM, no server ever responded. I tried everything I could to try to play this game again, but the servers wouldn't budge. I made a new character, I made a new account, I tried to talk to the devs, they wouldn't respond, nothing would happen. So I eventually had to give up this fun game. So if you plan on getting this game, if it works, don't plan on playing for more than, hmm, about a year? I dunno, I just wish they could fix this game.

1784	0	a	this is a kind of a Pay 2 Win game ,if you want items :better play for 4 years or buy them .don't download
1785	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
1786	0	a	Another p2w, pile of trash, only this time, its the revival of the fastest mmo to ever be shut down. Thats always a beacon of confidence.
1787	0	a	This game is aids and you shouldn't spend money on it
1788	0	a	Cancer.
1789	0	a	The developers of this game are f*cking f*ggots and they deserve all the hate they get. They don't respect the community at all and they just want you to pay for their sh*t instead of maybe getting a small boost since the game should actually be enjoyable enough to do so, but the servers are slower than an alsimers patient trying to remember the faces of their children.
1790	0	a	This Pay 2 Win Game gets boring quickly because of shooting people over and over again they could host more events but they're too lazy to do that because they're 'making' weapons and making huge prices for them if you think this game is Free 2 Play then you are WRONG this game will not let you progress through it without BUYING it
1791	0	a	Bad game, pay to win.
1792	0	a	  This is the perfect game if your standards are low or when your life isn't worth anything to you anymore
1793	0	a	It would be a good game if it wasn't pay to win
1794	0	a	.
1795	0	a	I have been to funerals more fun than this
1796	0	a	&lt;-- my first reaction of how bad this game is   Pros: +A lot of customization +Free  Cons: -Pay to win -Bad graphics -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ matchmaking -No proper tutorial -2 hours is wasted into creating your character  Final verdict: Terrible game which sounds good, DON'T play it 4/10
1797	0	a	My hairline cutter made me play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It was legit, but one flaw. I try to noscope someone and it doesn't work. Wtf? This is the worst game i've played since call of duty ghosts. I feel like i just cut both of my wrists while making a remake of GTA. ok? Stop trying to make a GTA and get a life. if i cant make yawspeed, what is life? i cant 360 just by pressing Q? WTF! This is the worst. @FaZeRain @FaZeAdapt @FaZeApex @FaZe Banks @Faze Blaziken. I hope that this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on in 2 hours. I am not ever going back to my Hairline Cutter AGAIN, because he told me about this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. before you get this game please look at this..... @EverySteamMemberThatViewsThisStorePage
1798	0	a	GTA for poor people  Pros -... -Riddled with hackers yet not as many as GTA V currently has?  Cons -Pay to win -Extremely boring -Toxic community -Only way to make the real cash is by either paying for it or by playing a hundred PvP missions, or a thousand PvE missions, it's like you're getting punished for not wanting to play against other players, which is extremely dull. -All the cars are basically one big hitbox, you can't shoot people through car windows and the top speed is basically the same for all vehicles. And if you want to customize your character or vehicles to a higher extent you need to pay real money for PREMIUM.  To sum it up. It's dull as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1799	0	a	That moment when ur teammate tries to kill u so u unload 3 magazines of your assault rifle into him and blow up a car in front of him but he walks up to u 2 seconds later and uses his pay 2 win gun to kill u in less than 1 second xdxdxdxdxd
1800	0	a	Words cnat even describe how pay to win this is, but I can try.  First off it is important to note that the 'tutorial' the game gives you is little mpore than some stuff that you need to do, but it doesnt really say how and while you do it, your not in a seperate part of the game like most mmo's, no you are in the game, with no clue what to do.   Expect to have to pay a lot of gold to get anything in this game, although some cheap weapons are decent, the only last for 7 days, that is right, you have to buy new weapons every 7 days. Anything that is permanent like guns or cars, will cost you lots of money.  The whole G1C thing really ticks me off, its a premium currency used that you have to buy, (or earn in painfullly small amounts) that can buy the best of everything.   Matchmaking is broken, new players vs old, 5 v 2, etc   Story is almost nothing, imagine a quilt with 5 patches that are decnt looking, but they are all spread apart and sewn together using a dark brown thread that makes it look ugly.  Honestly, when i got this game, i saw the bad reviews and thought 'Whatver, this game looks awesoeme!', and even though i started with no expectations, somehow, this bundle of steaming horse crap has gone below my lowest expectations. Do not play this game, please, just trust me.  Overall -10/10
1801	0	a	The game was fun while it lasted, arresting people, clan war all that stuff was fun, however, two things ruined it; One, the game became very pay to win. I mean, you could play and still kill SOME people, but if someone has a gun that cost 3.99 and you've got your little peashooter, you're dead meat.  Two, and this is the main thing, and if it gets fixed, I'll come back to playing it, and I may be tempted to pay some money, but this really isn't easy to fix. Here goes: The game has a few servers, one for newbies, one for casuals, and one for veterans. The problem is that casuals and veterans will repeatedly get themselves killed to lower their rank, and then they gang up on the newbies. Yes, people are that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. They think their big and bad when they do that, and they call everybody 'Noob!' and think they're good.  Overall, I think the game is really awesome, but until they find a way to keep veterans away from the casuals and newbies, the game is unplayable. You can't even get better, because you're litteraly dead within seconds.

You'll see that this is totaly Fu cked up, Pay2Win, BUT, you also can play with some redeem codes realy well at the start. It's not the best game but also not the worst GTA knock off, Watch_Dogs is worse than that. But, the commiunety is full of As s holes! You want to play a mission 'n win that damn missions, and Your own Team mates are killing You cuz You want to win the mission 'n earn money 'n help 'em. -10/10.

1831	0	a	For some people this game laggs... More enforcers are more stronger than Criminals for some reason... Fix the car glitches/bug-just a preiared car... i touch another car and its smoking.... The aim shooting right at the body and doesn't count or shoots in an other direction... Too much rage...(on the Criminals side Of Course) Too many hackers,idiots,teamkillers... Almost a P2W-Pay2Win game.  Not even going to recommend to play this game....
1832	0	a	I did write a very bad review on this game. THIS IS WHAT I WROTE. I have over 3000 hrs in this game, threat gold. If you like playing a game with 12 year olds ramming you with their car, trolling, no good teamwork then this game is for you. If you like playing on a outdated laggy engine this game is for you. If you like playing with crap guns that are totally unrealistic then play this game. People will say this game has skill, but what is the skill is the question?. Their isnt any. If you know how to tap fire, duck, move left to right, camp, spray, sneak up and steal your teammate's kill then you will be pro. In mission districts all the gold threat players play in the silver district. The gold district is 0 in population. You have players that will dethreat to silver to just go to the bronze district to troll with osmaws. The game is very unpopulated also.    Gamersfirst support sucks. I got scammed awhile back I was trying to trade a N-HVR Reaper for another lengend, I contacted gamersfirst support, and reported the incident and they took care of that and I got my gun back. Got scammed again and contacted support. I was trading a condor for another legend. And I showed them proof of that incident. And they told me that they would be glad to help me. They banned the person yeah. But I did not get back my gun. They told me that they were sorry that the restoration of my item wasn't available at the moment. So I messaged them back and told them about how I got my lengendary back before when I was scammed. They replied saying they only do it one time. If they only do it just one time. They should just ban ingame trading or make a trade system. Because people spend alot of money on joker boxes for legendarys, and you have people that has spent alot of time getting legendarys.      The good things about this game are. 1. Great Charactercustomization 2. Only game I know with a music studio 3. Good symbol designer, if you have premium 4. Car constumization, but very few cars. 5. Good clothing designer if you have premium. If you don't have premium you are limted on what you can do.  BUT STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT. This game is not that bad its just Gamersfirst that makes it bad. It's an actual really good game. Just owned by the wrong people. It's very unique game. No game is like it. I'm not going to say don't play. Play it because if this game gets more populated it may get better one day. I feel like if it died. It would stay dead forever. I don't want that to happen. I know the weapons aren't very realistic but that may change one day. Who knows. Maybe if the engine update really happens; maybe it will fix alot of things and make it better. I can only hope so. BUT PLAY IT. IGNORE ALL THE BAD REVIEWS. ITS NOT THAT BAD. THIS GAME WILL JUST MAKE YOU SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT IT. AND YOU WILL COME BACK PLAYING IT. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN YOU WILL.   Thinking about it again though â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ This game!!! Old piece of crap that they aren't ever going to fix and update. It's a joke on Xbox after watching gameplay videos of it it lags worse than it does on PC.
1833	0	a	Hello all, im italian but im want to give my comments in Enghish, so many people can look this comments becuse  Enghish is a international language, so take some time to read all this can help you in some way. Im start to play in 2010 when the game start, was good and cool and im play for, well im don't remember now, for 4 or 5  years. This game is become like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, is a pay to win, sometime when i was play i become angry, frustration, sad. Sometime i was play with some friend and we have good moments. I play and im know well how to play, i become so much time rank gold, i never buy weapons, and never buy in the shop. The problem of the game are this 1) Pay to win. 2) Sometime Lag. (also sometime when you drive car is uncontrollable) 3) Hacker and cheater. 4) oh my god, what is all this clothes in the shop all the time ? is like APB is become a fashion game, where people do  parade of fashion. 5) if you win the people say you are a hacker, cheater, idiot, you don't know how to play 6) if you lose, the people say you are a loser, noob, you don't know how to play 7) so community is like a cancer, everyone hates everyone 8) in my opinion administrators of game, don't care about kick cheater out the game 9) unbalanced challenges, in sever bronze you find silver, in sever silver, you find gold, how you can play if you are  silver, and you find gold player ?  listen, if you want try this game, don't try, if you play this game, and you get angry, frustration and sad, stop to play like  me. Not worth the effort play a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, if the only think can give to you is Health problems.  Marco
1834	0	a	This game is the worst game ever created. I don't know why anyone plays it anymore. It has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ physics which makes the characters looks and feel like sims characters. The shooting on the game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dreadful that I'd rather play call of duty and don't mention the driving which is worse than crazy taxi physics. It's guns are really bad, and to get a decent weapon wouldn't you know... You have to pay, and it's on a loan most of the time so you gotta pay every week or so. Why would anyone play this game? I don't know... Maybe to get ebola or some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Please just think about playing Runescape or Super mario or nothing infact. Before you pick this toxic aids up.
1835	0	a	I would call this game Pay to Win. Argue if you want, but it's a multiplayer PVP game for the most part and you can buy cooldowns, permanent weapons ( some with exclusive mods, ) 2.25 times more cash gains etc...  You can buy pretty much everything permanently with real money right off the bat, be it cars, weapons, etc. If you want to be 100% Free to Play, be ready to spend tons of gold on 10-days lasting weapons. You will have to gather money for days to get one permanent weapon, only if someone is selling one on the Marketplace. The community is terrible, there's many bugs, random downtimes which cancel your missions and you lose the rewards you would have gotten for that misson. Also you can slaughter the whole city and be unnoticed, but be wary that breaking a store window by mistake, not even stealing anything and the other players playing enforcers can arrest you and steal all the money you have on you!  Also the matchmaking is terrible, sometimes you get matched with 2 other silvers and you have to face 3 golds. Your whole team could be rank 20 and you play against rank 200+ which have more mods, better cars, knows the game more and have better weapons. You have ''Bronze, Silver and Gold'' servers, but they're full of golds who like to pwn noobs either way. Only the leader can call for backup and people go AFK randomly pretty often.  Also, if your team leader ( which seems to be random because 90% of the time I join a mission I am not the leader, ) decides that he dosen't like you, he can kick you right before the mission ends to make you lose all the money and experience you would've gotten. He can also kick you just because you killed him by mistake, just because you sprayed a tag before him or even because you are MVP and he wants to be MVP instead!  The good? It's probably one of the only MMO that looks like GTA and Saints Row. The graphics are ok and the game has alot of content. Sadly, it's not a game I would play more than I already did after noticing all the flaws it has.  Here's the benefit of premium ( forums says it's 12.50$ per month: )  Around 90% bonus to all Contact XP gains. +125% bonus cash gain ( Instead of 500$ for a mission you would gain 1125$. ) 20% discount on the Armas Marketplace ( Real money marketplace. ) 50% shorter cooldown on abilities like Field supplier, Nitro booster, etc. ) Deeper Customization (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing items, 100 layers per Symbol. ) Removal of Subscription ADS ( which appears at the end of all missions. ) Armas Trials for weapons and vehicles last 3 hours instead of 30 minutes ( which makes using the 200~ trials, 6 times more effectively. )

1837	0	a	No thank you....
1838	0	a	this game ruined my sound.
1839	0	a	Tutorials are not at all helpful. The matchmaking system is totally non-existant, as a new player i was matched against players who had hundreds of hours of play time consistantly leaving missions with no reward or xp.

1851	0	a	This game is awful and installed Search.Conduit onto my pc, which is a malware toolbar program which took over an hour to fix and i'm still certain that its still got some files on my hard drive... install at your own risk.  it changed my homepage from google to Search.Conduit  Took several uninstalls and involved CCleaner to remove it from my pc. needed to delete my internet explorer back to its default settings.  Please don't install this game.
1852	0	a	It says I have 4 hours, but that is not the case. Those 4 hours are from the game not opening properly. I have not had a chance to see any actual gameplay, but from my experience with the game as far as I had gotten, I wasn't going to continue. Many people have complained about the dev, and I kinda agree! Don't play this.
1853	0	a	I have created a character. About to choose which server im going to play on. Click on the one with lowest ping. And then I cant click the next button. Whats the problem?
1854	0	a	Ah, I played this game on G1 till i got sick of it, why? Servers lagging, noobs hacking and unbalanced weapons beside P2W. Yeah it was a 3 years waste of my life.
1855	0	a	Such an odd game... But almost like a sh*tty saints row
1856	0	a	One day, i am looking around in the Freeplay section of Steam, trying to find a good game me and my brother can play, at the moment, i have a 2008 high-end gaming PC, and my brother has a 2014 Hasee Gaming laptop. I am outstanded, the trailer makes the game look brilliant, the graphics are amazing, the customization is crazy! It's like the best fruit-smoothie ever. Insane cars, crazy firefights, i thought i'd just struck gold! I rush to the download button.  *SOME TIME LATER*  The game is still installing, i rush over to my brothers PC, and i love the look of the game already!  *15 MINUTES LATER*  dx11.dll was not found. It says in the requirements, dx 9 is required to play it, as a minimum.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this.  
1857	0	a	  Open world tps game. This game features two factions, cops and criminals. One can enter world as any of the two. Characters are highly customisable. It has almost 6 maps, but matchmaking on in only 3 maps or districts (as called in game). Game play is average not so smooth. Matchmaking is worst. Beginners are mostly matched against gold and silver badges (bronze&lt;silver&lt;gold). The main problem is that old players who are gold and silver badge, have many accessories like body armour, fast cars, grenade launchers, etc etc which make it very difficult for new players to get kills against them. Eventually they feed on you, kill u a thousand times as new players get some basic guns and a trash car.   Final verdict : This is a pay to win game. If u can buy items with real money then u stand a chance. And is basically poorly developed GTA .   Sorry for long post. Heres ur kawaii potato
1858	0	a	Got banned for no reason Support says I got banned for 'inappropriate behavior' 10/10 400+ hrs wasted best game of the year

1860	0	a	Great game if you like getting killed over and over by the monsterous waves of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing grenade launchers, Sniper smg's, or the nuking lock on timed grenades so ya 10/10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ nuggets
1861	0	a	Was a great game back when it was not yet taken over by gamersfirst (more like payers first). This game ot self is amazing if you dont mind paying. Cause this game is pay to win to its max. If you dont pay you will, even if you are very skiled, lose. The weapons bought with cash ar way more powerfull then any weapon getabletrough playing. Its sad to see this game like this cause i have played from closed beta until and even sometime when it went free to play.
1862	0	a	Whatever you're thinking of doing with your life...Searching through free games or any other kind of games...Install ANY but not this game...This game has officially been overrun by hackers, it was once a good game (2010-2013) but now it's dead to me deep inside...DONT INSTALL THIS GAME.
1863	0	a	If you have 2GB RAM and a graphics card below 9400 GT generation then this game wont start
1864	0	a	*** UPDATED ***  A game that shut down two weeks after its initial release because of Realtime Worlds closing their doors. GamersFirst took control of the game, and in short it is now a tower of duct tape.  The premise at first seems cool, gangs and vigilantes fighting in a modern urban environment, with 100 players in one map causnig chaos. The issue is Realtime Worlds nor GamersFirst even bothered to adapt their own servers or the netcode to handle that many people. While you won't experience unplayable lag, there will occassionally be spikes.  APB Reloaded's community is nothing but pure toxicity, consisting of adults and teenagers alike with the mentality of a child. Yelling/swearing in chat or voice is not uncommon, and their fuses are like that of a munitions warehouse. The worst part is this community thinks the game qualifies as an e-sport, if you can read that through all the vulgarity.  Old recylced humor, internet celebrity wanna be's, and sex jokes are all too common and this is one of the reasons I left. It annoyed me to no end.  Probably the most sinister of activities is the company running it. They made it Pay to Win locking all the cool stuff to paying, and is hellbent on taking advantage of the toxic community in order to squeeze every single penny out of them.  The only reason you should play this is for griefing purposes. Play as an offensive character and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ someone off, that's all I ever did, and I will never forget the golden reactions.
1865	0	a	if you play this game and waste money on it your the most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ person ever . in this you can camp roofs and shoot noobs drive a car have SUPER LAG!. its really bad and the servers are hosted from the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing moon.

Plus it's full of weeaboos and nerds, another reason for uninstall this game.

1889	0	a	WHY WAS THIS MADE   i cant even make a character, the story is horrible and gameplay is way too glitchy
1890	0	a	This f*cking game, it almost gave me an aneurism. It is so terrible, as my friend Jack mentioned you either fork out $30 for a gun that isn't very good, or grind for weeks for a sh*tty cosmetic item such as shoes. The optimization is awful, the community is a bunch of 12 year olds, cars handle like there's no gravity, and the interface doesen't even work and/or is confusing as sh*t. Hackers everywhere and glitchers constantly killing you. Even with the poor anticheat if there even is one. This game is truly, one of the absolute WORST programs I have ever had on my hard drive. And who the hell sells a $100 DLC that has very little to offer??? Dafuq?  1/10.

1903	0	a	Unless G1 fixes the matchmaking, new players should probaly stay away from this game, The matchmaking is terrible, Having to play against Rank 255 when im rank 87 is not fun at all, Threat does not matter at ALL in this game, You can still be a Silver Rank 255 and drop into a bronze district and just destroy all the new players, I dont know WHY people do it, but its not fun for new players or amateur players.
1904	0	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bad, pay to win, hackers and cheaters run around as they please, cops dominate the criminals. what i mean by that is if u are in a crominal and 1 enforcer spots u while he's in a party of 4 there squad will stun u with u having no hope of getting your stash back. the fact a enfocer can stun someone and completely take them out of the fight for 30 seconds is rediculously 1 sided and crominals have no special tools of the sort. This basiclly tells al new pllayers to pay as enforcer and if you want to have fun catch a criminal in the act and get the jump on him before he even knows that he got caught so you can steal all of his stash. In reality the is enjoyabllle with my friends but the game coulld be alot better if playes that played longer didnt have such over powered guns making it that much harder for casual or new players. if they dont fix some of these balancing issues I don't see much of a future for this game
1905	0	a	This game used to be a ton of fun. I would like to say that I wasn't that bad at it, and enjoyed a lot of it. That was a while ago...  The Pay 2 Win aspect seemed to be heavily promoted as new, better, faster, and stronger weapons were released for those who could afford them. I never bothered paying real money on this game. The only two weapons I actually bought and tried, were a sniper rifle and an submachine gun. Now, these guns were decent, but very overpriced as I could only use them for a short amount of time. Besides, why pay for a gun when I can do just as well with the default? Either way I was helpless if I was playing against someone who had premium..  The customization in this game is unmatched. You could sit in the outfitter or garage for hours tweaking and playing with designs and customizing. The things you could unlock from the missions is the only reason I actually did them most of the time. The increasing amount of lag made driving, combat, and missions a hell for me as well as my friends.   Recently, the only fun I had actually gotten out of this game is when my friend and I would â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with others, not taking the game seriously. Actually playing the game was frustrating and sad..
1906	0	a	I cant launch it closes the launcher i hope the dev gets ran over ohhhh and watch 10000000 fanboys are going to spam me with tiyney wittle wage commwents oooh im willy swarwd &gt;:( i hate this stupid idiotic developers!

1909	0	a	dont really see the point to the game, and dont plan on having too much fun unless you pay. graphics are pretty bad to boot
1910	0	a	Full of bugs and errors strait from the start
1911	0	a	The game is not great, and the hackers in the early days ruined the experience for most, but in the end this was still one of the greatest role play experiences I have ever had. The customization options allow for true diversity as well, and if not for the money grab that G1 calls their Free 2 Play / Micro-transactions, this game would be one of the most impressive in history. Instead it falls flat, as was clearly evidenced by the complete lack of reception when RTW introduced it at E3 in 2010.
1912	0	a	This game... If its not the unbalanced matchmaking that gets u annoyed in this game its the hackers or the 12 year old children who use their moms credit card to buy a bazooka and the fastest car in the game to make other peoples gameplay a living hell. Game has a great concept but thats as far as it gets. Developers are just too greedy trying to satisfy their own needs than actually balancing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in this game.

1929	0	a	This is a great game. This game is a sandbox MMO like GTA but with more customization options. The only problem with this game is the overwhelming amount of cheaters and the game lack of action to stop them. You can find cheat for this game with a quick Google search. So unless you're willing to buy to cheat or get lucky enough to be teamed with someone who has, your going to spend 75% of your time playing this game being killed repeatedly by one person with ungodly ability to know where you and your teammates are at all times and has perfect aim.
1930	0	a	pretty boring game i think. It takes a long time for a new player to get anything at all in terms of cars clothes weapons and so on without spending loads of money for those stuff.  That's why i don't recommend this game.

1939	0	a	APB would be a recommend IF they 1) stopped premade gold(high threat good players) from making premade groups and farming new players on what is supposed to be a beginners server. They have ignored this issue and literally chased off 90% or more(no exaggeration) of their playerbase. Sort of the Obama of Developers, ignore the problem until it becomes so bad that they are forced to and then instead of taking action they say 'We are looking into it, bear with us a few years and we will probably do something about it' meanwhile it only gets worse.  2) Do even more about hackers. Fairfight was the first real step the developers took in combating Hackers, again only out of the exodus of players from the game because of it. They knew it was a problem in Beta and ignored it completely until 4 years later when combined with the problem I mentioned in the First point, the population is so sparse and they hardly make money.    The Good: 1) Customization is amazing. By far the most customizable game I have come across as far as looks, music and graphics. Simply put, Amazing.  2) WHEN you get a fight of somewhat even teams, it can be so much fun it is almost worth dealing with the 2 problems listed above. But even on Bronze server, which is where brand new players start, games which you will not face a premade group are maybe at best 50%. The premade groups you do fight against will be gold or highly experienced silver(they do tricks to lower their threat level so they can keep farming bronze for easy wins which I guess is fun to them) armed with rocket launchers, high level weapons modded out and grenade launchers.    TLDR: Unless they fix the bronze servers instead of just talking about it as well as improve their hack detection even more, stay away and do not reward the developers.
1940	0	a	This is a game I wish I could love because who doesn't want to play Cops And Robbers: Online?  Sadly though, the game is absolutely broken by blatant, no apologies pay to win (which is a term I hear thrown around a lot but I have never found as relevant as with APB) policies, a pretty pronounced bias for the criminals, and flat-out meaningless 'matchmaking'.  Let me put it this way: after a one year hiatus, I came back and made a new character. As I was relearning the mechanics and how to play, I queued up for my first match and was pitted against a gold-ranked superhero who had a gun that killed me in two shots, a rocket launcher, and a machine gun for a secondary weapon. Only bother with this game if you have about a hundred bucks of disposable income that you want to spend on the in-game store.
1941	0	a	One of the worst MMO's I have ever played!! Choppy servers, co-op is bad also. Alot of the Geeks that play will join your group only to shoot you in the back. Just bad with no sense of community .
1942	0	a	Its good and if you like challenging opponents be my guest, but there is too many hackers.
1943	0	a	This game fails on the most basic of level: being entertaining.
1944	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ don't play it. The matchmaking is broken the graphics have much to be desired. The weapons are unbalanced and the Bronze Silver Gold status is useless. The level up is unclear and pointless since you don't matter only the standing you have with contacts does. The servers are laggy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and there is absolutely no server moderation leaving hackers open chance to ruin your missions. And other players can ghost your team for the enemy side telling them where you are. Also, random players in the world can smash and destroy objectives and your vehicles and can possibly kill you setting your whole team back. The game is not pay to win nor skill based but just depends on what hacks you bought from  {LINK REMOVED}  systemcheats.net . Don't bother waste your time on it.
1945	0	a	worst game ever, looks just like gta. but its really more like minecraft.
1946	0	a	This was one of the worst 'games' that i have ever played. It took almost two days to download. This is also supposed to be a free to play game, but I had to PAY to make an account. If you don't want want go through this, don't get this.
1947	0	a	I'd like to start this reveiw by saying that this game has alot of positive things about it, but it's brought down by many other things, for starters, The possibilities for customization is nearly limitless, but unless you pay, you can only use three symbols.'Ok not a problem, I'll just use as many custom symbols as I can!' No. You can only use 25 symbols per custom symbol, unless you pay for premium, you're stuck with this handicap, and they will remind you of this every chance they get.  So you can't make nice clothes, cars, or tattoos, there's still more to the game like mugging, driving, and missions right? Wrong, the premium handicap applies here too, anytime you earn cash from crimes, missions, or arrests, you only get a peice of it, and they remind you how to get that in-game cash (here's a hint, it involves paying a monthly fee). It's not just money they take from you, gaining repution with contacts takes longer too, it's like they think less of you for not paying them to talk to you.  So you've had it, you give in and decide to pay to take off the handicap, which costs 999 G1C, and you can't buy exactly 999 or even 1000 G1C, you can buy 800 ($10) or you can buy 1200 ($15). Well now that you have you're credits, you spend the first 999 on premium, that leaves you with 201, why not spend it on the Armas market? Because the only perament item you can buy, with that much G1C is clothes. Did I forget to mention the weapons you buy in-game, no matter how much you spend will only last 10 days?  Well now you have premium, you can put some pretty cool stuff on you're clothes, or on your car, nope. You get one page of basic shapes to work with, you have to grind and hope for new ones, or buy another page's worth from the Armas market, which costs 199 credits, for one page, same goes for fonts, and emotes, of all things, you can pay 1999 to unlock the other emotes, 2000 credits costs $25. Pretty outrageous right?  Assuming this doesn't bother you because you sit on a pile of money, there's still problems with the game, like aimbotting, or matchmaking. Let's start with hacks, I once saw an admin, join the district, one of the first questions he was asked is, 'Are you going to do anyhting about hackers?' He responded with this 'While we don't much care for hacking in our game it is allowed'.Then there's the matchmaking, and player's skill is tracked with bronze, silver, and gold ranks, and 9 times out of 10, I would be put up against 1-2 golds, even when I played with other people, the other team was or almost was made entirely out of gold players.  Despite the problems with the game both listed an not, it can still be pretty fun, and it has potential to be even better, but for now it's held back by glitches, hacks, exploits, and greed.
1948	0	a	The game seems good when you first play it, but slowly turns into you needing microtransactions to get better gear and personalisation options, seems like the game would be better if they were not trying to steal your money constantly.

1951	0	a	its piece of crap on a stick
1952	0	a	the pay to win element is cancer
1953	0	a	Horrible
1954	0	a	Let me first say that I have several hundred hours from the sandalone version, so I've played more than the 7.9 on my account. The game is fun, it's sort of like a knockoff GTA. You can be a bad guy, rob shops and get into turf wars, do fun violent things, etc. The games biggest benefit, though, is the fact that you can also be a cop. Any cop players who see the criminal players doing bad stuff or doing missions can immediately intervene and **** them up, which makes for some good fun, and fighting real players as cops is a lot more fun than the crappy AI in games like GTA.  However, this game suffers immensely from it's pay-to-win tactics, through which you will dominate all other players if you have $20 to blow. The devs tout your ability to customize your character, despite the fact that if you want to place more than a few decals on your car or make an intricate design on your clothes you again have to pay money. Want one of the good guns? Give us money. Want to use said guns for more than a few days? MORE money. Want to get a decent car? ALL THE MONEY. You want to KEEP that car? Oh baby you know that's only allowed if you want to spend money. 'Wow our game is so cool and free-to-play.'  Honestly if they scrapped all the pay-to-win stuff and just charged $10-$20 for the game, this would be a fantastic game. The core features and physics are strong, the gameplay is fun when you're not being bulldozed by people with expendable income, and the game has tons of variety. But all of these strengths are shadowed by the money-grubbing nature of this game. Until they update to a new engine as they've been promising for a long time, and at least cut back on the pay-to-win features, this game is NOT worth playing.   In my opinion, the devs should just design the game again from the ground up with a new engine and release it as a seperate game at a reasonable price. There's no excuse to not do that.

1963	0	a	Run around, shoot people, blow stuff up, it's all the same. APB Reloaded? What does 'Reloaded' have to do with this game? I'll tell you: nothing. APB Reloaded is a GTA clone whose only characteristic that sets it apart is the fact that it's free. Who doesn't want a free-to-play, third-person shooter where the goal is to ruin people's lives? The game itself is fine: I can tell the devolpers tried very hard, but APB has very little lastability. After a 20 minute game session, I'm tired of using cars to block the entrances to the main hubs of the map, I'm tired of crashing my cars into other players, in fact, I had more fun screwing around in this game than acually playing the missions. After a while, I had to create my own fun. Is that what you want in a game?   Because I know that I don't.  Nice try, but no cigar.
1964	0	a	Its gay and for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es

1966	0	a	It would probably be a bit better if this game wasn't a game where (paying) is not included casually
1967	0	a	Wanted to come back when saw announcment about new anti-cheat system. In first missions people followed my movement trough the walls, throw grenades at any of my cover spots, and vip instead of hiding was standing in the middle of the streets and killing all incoming enemies with pistol only. From any distance.  You are not a cheater? Forget about this game.
1968	0	a	I should start off by saying this game is 2laggy4me which puts me off in the first place but oh hohohho do not worry I have far more to talk about.  Now the only positive in this game is customization. You can truly make everything unique and it can be pretty fun to make your own car. But now lets start with everything â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the matchmaking puts you in with people who hack, have rocket launchers and who have dial up connection the hackers are at a fault of punkbuster and the rest is the result of people who play too long and people from far away countries. I constantly get put into a team with people from Spain (nothing against Spain) but they don't spek English and more importantly I don't speak Spanish so I can't coordinate. Next are the missions there all the same and pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Sandbox you ask? None oh sure there's a huge world but everytime I turn off matchmaking I just get put into a match anyway and even if i did roam most of the time they can't be killed unless you go into the pvp place (rocket launchers and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ galore). There isn't much to do really it has alot of things but doesn't perfect â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING P2W â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND IT SHOULD DIE. Except the customization idk put it in a good sandbox game like GTA

1975	0	a	i just dont have so much to say...never installing and its bad,its just bad
1976	0	a	This entire fricking game is PAY TO WIN, you can not do well what so ever UNLESS you drop 20$+ on a gun, it is not worth the time, the whole game consists of flaming and insults and the whole matchmaking system is so screwed up that you will constantly be put up against people who are veterans despite what ever your experience is in the game.  If you wish to constantly get angry nd possibly break things in your house, go ahead and get this game, other than that, it is not worth it.
1977	0	a	As much as I like the idea, and feel that if it was a bit better made that it could be something wonderful, it's just not that good. If it wasn't P2W and was polished up, the game could be SO MUCH BETTER. If somebody actually made this better, it would be one of the best games IMO, but I just don't see it ATM.
1978	0	a	My happiest moments when playing this game were the first time I installed it and the last time I uninstalled it.
1979	0	a	APB had me stoked when I first heard about it. Infinite customization and cops and robber gameplay with a little bit of GTA thrown in. The beta had me worried. Server lag, poor progression, broken weapons, unfinished districts and imbalanced and shallow gameplay and mission structure. But beta is for improvement right? Unfortunately the game did not get much better out of beta and it became one of the biggest disapointments in gaming. The developers went under shortly after and not much was heard about it. Until G1.  They decided to pick it up, dust off the ashes and try to improve things. And improve things they did. It's got more perks, more guns, better matchmaking, map improvements and even holiday events. Unfortunately the game is fundamentally broken. Server issues with the gunplay are still present, the cars drive a little better, but still very floaty and unresponsive. Gunplay itself is spotty. I have enough qualms about 3rd person shooters (seeing around a corner and waiting until someone is close or trapped somewhere to open up on them) before you start adding the multitude of imbalanced weapons, some of which require ridiculous time invenstments to earn, or of course cold hard cash. There are only 5 or so different mission types which you'll be going through over and over, all of which require camping.  And then there is the community. While it's difficult to look at any game and say that it has a wonderful community that will welcome you with open arms and give you advice and support and flowers etc, this game has one of the worst. Many if not most of the people in here are here to troll you. They will follow you with the biggest truck they can and ram you off the road during missions - they will ghost, telling their friends of all your movement or interfering from outside the mission with you unable to do a thing about it - and they will message you with some of the most hateful and insulting things you can imagine just for kicks.  This is still one of the best games out there when it comes to character customization and there is plenty of fun to be had with a few friends. But it has to be asked if it's worth putting up with everything else. I personally say no. This game is not enough fun, even free.
1980	0	a	APB:Reloaded is right under the definition of Pay to Win and Greed
1981	0	a	too much pay to win
1982	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1983	0	a	Could be a great game, too bad its actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Its like GTA except covered in actual hackers and scumbags, even if you manage to try and fight as befitting a gangman (drive-by) you end up deader than a blood in crip territory alone. (Vehicle explodes in half an enemy mag).  I mean if you like stealing furniture like its the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Rodney King riots then I guess it's okay.
1984	0	a	ok ever since i started playing and realtime worlds went bankrupt and you guys took over there has been constant server problems the same dam issue has been going on for months and you guys dont seem to give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. this would be a good game if you people would just fix these dam issues. obviously the servers this game is on now cant handle the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so maybe you should switch the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over or something. tired of paying for for this game i feel like im just wasting it making money of of us yet you guys dont want to take the time to fix these problems. so as of now my rate is pretty dam bad if you tell me. you guys dont deserve a good review at all.
1985	0	a	Doesn't work, can't play for the servers is down, shouldn't be on steam if it requires constant connection to a server!
1986	0	a	Well, the 1 hour I spent on this game was when it was loading.   10/10 would uninstall again
1987	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ P2W
1988	0	a	So many hackers. If you don't hack you will be used hard.
1989	0	a	Pay to win. Don't look further in the reviews. Heavily unbalanced due to the 'pay to win' system.
1990	0	a	To be honest i haven't played the game in a while but i just re-installed to see what has changed but other than that the game was good, I used to play it alot then the game just went downhill and I uninstalled. It is also very pay to win.
1991	0	a	A game that caters to people that aren't you. It will never be you. The game itself is broken at the core and the devs never bothered to fix it, because they are catered in turn by people who aren't you.  In this game you are a statistic in someone else's killrate. It's a round of Counter Strike where you only have a knife and all the other kids have deagles.  Skip this junk and save your hardware from inevitable physical rage violence.
1992	0	a	I remember when this game was just APB: All Points Buletin and man does it still suck as much. I really want to enjoy this game because there are very few if almost no open world cops and robbers games. In short don't let the screenshots and videos fool you, yes the customization is deep and the emblem system puts games like COD Black ops to shame. Yet everything else about this game is subpar and broken. 6 years and there is still a massive pay to win system and it feels as if there is one giant hitbox and that is it. There is no visible difference to damage when you shoot someone in the head or in the bloody pinkie toe. As good as I want it to be and as much as I can forgive and forget to enjoy myself this is not one of those games. Save your time and your cash in p2w bundles and go play GTA Online instead.
1993	0	a	SUCKS IF I COULD LOAD IT 
1994	0	a	Graphics no you get items like n warface no login no dont get it
1995	0	a	It may seem like I played a lot I really kept the launching program on  Should you play APB Reloaded... Just get GTA 4 kids
1996	0	a	In my 4 hours that i have played this, i have experienced hell. the hud is barely managable, im barely able to understand whats going on around me. ive read almost 3 guides on this game. all wasted time. when i got into my first mission we had already lost. i made it to the objective to be shot down and killed in a single bullet. second mission, same thing. third, fourth i was catching on, all the players i were playing against had spend money on this game. i dont spend money on free to play games, and when i do its when i really enjoy it and want to support the game. (ie rift, neverwinter, and team fortress 2). i am not going to sit back and be completely destroyed by people who have wasted money on a concept that is beyond convulted and overdone. not to mention, all the servers on here are over flooded with idiots and racist â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. so, 2/10. not even that. -10/10.
1997	0	a	I made 3 characters, 2 of them were Criminals, 1 of them was a enforcer. When i played the game i would play with one of my criminals more often with my friends, every time i did i would always die from a higher level player. Me and my friends never won a game, one of my friends decided to buy a weapon with real money way better than the rest of us. And we still got rekt. I dunno why the developers of this game dont make better matchmaking and servers with low levels. Although when i played with my enforcer, i found a group of hackers and i joined them and had fun. For the first time in APB Reloaded i had fun. Then i realized that the only way you can be able to actually play this game is if you are willing to give up your hard earned cash or hack the game.
1998	0	a	spent all my time playing in a laggy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ character creator that didnt even change some aspects of the character even when i was supposedly changing them, just to sit at a forever 'Connecting to District Server...' screen.  no, its not my end that is faulty. i have high end hardware(not some junky poor man's piece), win7 ultimate 64bit(its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 2015, no reason to have 32bit unless its for softwar specific needs, which is what compatibility mode is for.... so still no reason for 32bit), high end internet in a suburb area(not junky comcast out in the middle of nowhere), and all gigabit/cat6 networking. Perfect connection to other US servers (and a few EU and JP servers), but not this one. I cant even properly review this game, because i cant even get it to work.
1999	0	a	This game is fun if your 12.
2000	0	a	This game is just a Carbon-Copy of Crackdown for Xbox 360. Don't waste your time because it is mostly pay to win and you could use your hard-drive space for another bad f2p game.
2001	0	a	Downloaded game, made character, loaded server for 10 minutes, quit.  checked online for solutions, ran repair on files, downloaded something, tried again  loaded server for 5 minutes, uninstalled  you get one chance worthless game.
2002	0	a	This game is full of tricks to steal your money. They have the least balanced game I've ever seen. The game is far from realistic taking way to many shots to kill, and having way to much muzzle rise. If you're after a not so serious game, this might be fun with some friends if you're just driving your vehicles around like crazy, but it gets old fast. This game pretty much sucks all around...
2003	0	a	It's like GTA with micro transactions.
2004	0	a	Great game. Corrupt company. Don't play it.
2005	0	a	Could be the best grand theft auto game ever if they didn't just want to make money, powerful weapons are only yours for a certain time then you have to rebuy them
2006	0	a	cars go slow.

2008	0	a	i wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, infact me and my fiancee are furious with this game. 2/3 years ago, i use to play alot and loved it. but sadly to say duty called and left for basic, and now time has passed, i am overseas and have time to kill and downloaded this game and was not able to get on. i talk to an admin and they were very rude, and straight up said they due not to lift the supposed perm ban they have on me for no reason. they said my account violated there rules and would not tell me how. i never talk in chat and spent all my time doing missions, and most of it was trying to build a dream car. sadly to say game also rob me of my money. i paid for premium for 1 month which i know i wont get that back, but i also spent money on a vehicle and will most likely not see that too, and that's what has us furious. i was a valued customer to them and actually put some money in, and some how i violated there rules? seeing other people comments left here shows i was not the only one who is having these issues.   please do yourself the favor and just find another game. they will rob you of your money and time and effort into the game and then most likely ban you for some reason they decide whether you did it or not. seems like a scam to get you to make another account to make people come back, they only ban your account and not ip. seems odd but yeah. Switching to grand theft auto 5 was the best decision ever. but if anyone has any games that allows me to build trucks and customize them. please let me know!  and again, don't download the game save your time!

2009	0	a	This game is'nt even worth trying, take it from me. Great concept, yet so many problems. 1.] Every 5 or so minutes the game kicks you. No matter what, making the game barley playable. 2.) I'ts a pay-to-win game. In reality it's not free, as you can't go halfway through teh game without paying. It's a waste of space. A waste of time. Wouldn't play it if it was the only game on earth. 0/10 go die in a hole pls.
2010	0	a	Love the idea of this game. What I don't like is that it feels like playing counter strike. Everyone spends their time jumping up and down to avoid bullets. And the initial load up procedure is horrible.
2011	0	a	2 words, Micro Transactions. you go figure the rest out!
2012	0	a	it wont let me log in it keep say im not old enough  (im 16 year old)  is that old enough to play that game?
2013	0	a	Started mission, went to objective, own team killed me. Im sorry but what the F**k is the point to this game if nobody is doing the objectives and even stopping others from doing it.
2014	0	a	It wont load up when I click the game to play. It just stops at the loading screen please help!
2015	0	a	THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK WHEN YOU IN STALL IT!!!!!!!!!
2016	0	a	when it first came out i loved it, though i could only run it on 10 fps., now several years later with a new pc i tried it agian, and i have never been so disapointet... when you are new to the game you join pvp games where your teammates are just as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as you are, but your opponents is insanely high rank and ofc. also pay to win so even if you snipe them 5 times in head before they even see you, they just turn around and instagib you with ump or a handgun. so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing broken because of some greedy developers!
2017	0	a	Have you always wanted to play in bland, dead worlds? Have you always wanted to play a lame GTA ripoff? Do you want to waste space on your computer hard drive?  If all of those answers are no, don't get this. GTA is worth the money.
2018	0	a	I have played a long while without steam since close Beta, all G1 gamers are friendly and F2P.   Till 2013, P2W became hot topic in this game and i totally AGREE those people who invest a lot of MONEY in this game can have HIGH CHANCE TO WIN,  That trigged gamers (most of them are UNMATURE KIDS) tried to use with HACK PROGRAMMES for tricking G1 points and gaming that happened on 3 servers(EU, NA, HK). [Check youtube please, Gamerfirst]  The threat system became a joke for me. FAKE GOLD, HACKER CLAN.  I believe people will change, and game as well,  but it have become worst than what gamers should EXPERIENCE( ENJOYMENT, EXCITMENT and TEAMWORK).  Im sick of the communty with hackers and team killers.  Please someone help this game.
2019	0	a	First of all, this game isn't free to play, though if you do play it like it is, you will be very disappointed, because you'll be overpowered by almost every player out there in the game who either has too much money on his hands to splurge on a game or has no life and has been playing it 24/7 for the past 5 years, because that's the amount of time you need to put in the game in order to be on the same level as rich players and actually somewhat enjoy the game, so it's more like Free to Play Like a Noob Unless You Pay Up, One point to note is that the mechanics of the game is subpar. Graphics is average. Gameplay is so repetitive it hurts and is unbalanced to boot.  The pros of the game would be rich customization, but you can't fully enjoy it for the aforementioned reasons.   The conclusion is that the game was made for simply making money and the complete disregard for the community makes it virtually unbearable, so If you're a masochist or dumb enough to pony up the devs or take part in their little schemes for earning the G1C, this game is for you.
2020	0	a	Pay 2 win...
2021	0	a	Dont ever ever play this game it is made only for ppl who pay money,if u just want to get it for free and play it u will get dominated and killed then killed,killed.....
2022	0	a	This is a game I wish I could love because who doesn't want to play Cops And Robbers: Online?  Sadly though, the game is absolutely broken by blatant, no apologies pay to win (which is a term I hear thrown around a lot but I have never found as relevant as with APB) policies, a pretty pronounced bias for the criminals, and flat-out meaningless 'matchmaking'.  Let me put it this way: after a one year hiatus, I came back and made a new character. As I was relearning the mechanics and how to play, I queued up for my first match and was pitted against a gold-ranked superhero who had a gun that killed me in two shots, a rocket launcher, and a machine gun for a secondary weapon. Only bother with this game if you have about a hundred bucks of disposable income that you want to spend on the in-game store.
2023	0	a	Driving is sh*t, matching ising balanced, you have new players matched with players with full mods that its just a one sided fight
2024	0	a	pay to play, laggy, crap. dont wast your time
2025	0	a	This is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game!
2026	0	a	Bugs, trolls, unbalanced combat and a general pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2027	0	a	Game is terrible , I forgot what Ragequitting was until I played this game .Matchmaking is beyond broken ,the missions in this game are repititive and dumb as Sh*t(Vip Missions).This game gets updated frequently and yet 4 years later still running into the same problems.If 'Gamer'sFirst' Couldn't fix it 4 years back they sure as hell can't fix it now.   Bottom Line I DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone.
2028	0	a	A really stupid game with bad graphics, GTA III level bad, and you have to pay to even enjoy this game or else you just respawn... die and repeat  very infuriating, and very stupid people running it, the only good (and bad) thing about it is there is always new guns and stuff that's always better than what came before it, just to keep you buying more and more useless items with your hard earned money...   Oh yea, and don't glitch coz they ban you for that, and they see that it's not their job to fix it, it's your job not to exploit it... lol
2029	0	a	the game tend to go repetitive after a while, there pay 2 win guns that can easily overpower normal ones even tho u can get them in game playing which it will take ages literally. there performance issue with some pc mostly Fps laggs. Uninstalled due to poor matchmaking in game.
2030	0	a	cant even play when its starting it just freezes and i have to restart my computer samething when i got it from the website if fixed i will try again for now dont download
2031	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing garbage, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gameplay, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tutorial, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game that keeps running even when you quit. 10/10 would play again
2032	0	a	Ya, how about no.
2033	0	a	ughhh 
2034	0	a	trying ot get it to work the struggle is real
2035	0	a	no no no no no no no no no after waiting for 2.5 hours for this joke to download then had to register to play it only to find out i have to download it again while its just finished downloading i will unistall after this full stop.
2036	0	a	wot a peece of sheet
2037	0	a	'Oh man this game looks awso-' Got headshoted in the head by a sniper. *respawns* 'Alright! let's g-' gets a pellets from a shotgun in the back. *respawns* 'Just give me a mome-' gets blown up by a rocket launcher. *respawns* 'What the fu-' Gets ran over. *respawns*  'Ok â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this gam-' Gets banned. Morale of the story: Just give up. Besides music and customizations, this game doesn't hold anything intersting. And though it seems like I don't know anything about this game in my 16 hours of gameplay, I have another 200+ gameplay hours from an older account that I played it back in 2013, and trust me, this game almost hasn't changed a bit since.
2038	0	a	Fun untill you loose Premium ;_;  Im not paying for that.
2039	0	a	For a free to play its worth a shot but I did not love it too much.
2040	0	a	If you download this game you will find 3 important things: LAG,CHEATERS, and, the most important of all, UNINSTALL BUTTON.  Just...nope, it doesn't deserve to be played
2041	0	a	APB... a P2W game where losers who don't have any skill in games gather to buy weapons that give them advantage so that they can feel a little bit better about themself when they destroy someone with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pistol/smg in few hits... that about sums it all up i guess, nothing else needs to be said about this game besides it not being worth your time, don't worther downloading it because you will be disappointed very quickly and you will regret ever being born into a world where this game exists, id rather watch my windows update itself rather than play this game.
2042	0	a	You'll only enjoy this game if your good. Other than that its a rage fest. Its not a pay to win, but as I said you need skill to enjoy the game or win it. Other than that the customization is amazing, but you need premium to put more than 5 decals on a car, 25 decals in an emblem, or 5 decals on clothing. The matchmaking is a complete mess, new people will really have a hard time when they get matched up with veterans...  I only recommend this game if you have the patience to die a lot.
2043	0	a	GAME IS JUST WAY TO OVERRATED .JUST A CRAPY EXAMPLE OF COMPANYS FAILS TO CREATE SOMTHING NEW RATHER THAN TRING TO MAKE IT ANOTHER GTA UNISTALL THIS GAME WHILE YOU CAN IT WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND SPACE WELL IF YOU DONT CHEW BIG RED THEN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU..LOL
2044	0	a	This is a game where cash is king, and not in game cash, I mean real cash, I dont want to spend big bucks for better weaponry and cars, this game would be good if it wasnt this way and the dlc was less pricey more guns were available ingame,same with cars, and a easy to understand tutorial too
2045	0	a	Just a wannabe gta:SA
2046	0	a	This game could be so good. But. greedy devs, bad community, no community, P2W, no beginner support, lack of playable content, no new content, laughable matchmaking, small maps, few maps, free guns suck, free guns are temporary, level system sucks, unlockables are well locked, ect... I could go on probably but whats the point its all written in other reviews. I do hope some how, some way, this game gets put in the hands of people more capable and returned to the relm of f2p, because unless all you plan to do is customize you character or melody or clothes or car or emblems, ect... you have to Pay to Win. I cant reccomend a game that cant be played. So hurry up and fix it!
2047	0	a	This f*cking game, it almost gave me an aneurism. It is so terrible, as my friend Jack mentioned you either fork out $30 for a gun that isn't very good, or grind for weeks for a sh*tty cosmetic item such as shoes. The optimization is awful, the community is a bunch of 12 year olds, cars handle like there's no gravity, and the interface doesen't even work and/or is confusing as sh*t. Hackers everywhere and glitchers constantly killing you. Even with the poor anticheat if there even is one. This game is truly, one of the absolute WORST programs I have ever had on my hard drive. And who the hell sells a $100 DLC that has very little to offer??? Dafuq?  1/10.
2048	0	a	Not bad game but staff is suck. I spent a lot of money to this game and they banned me twice with no reason.
2049	0	a	In this games current state, its god awful. It rewards credit card warriors vastly. You can buy the best weapons in the game for next to nothing. And gives new players little to no direction. Just stay away.
2050	0	a	The game would always launch but the game would never actually start up, yet Steam would say it was running.
2051	0	a	I dont feel like this game should be on steam free2play list, it should be on pay2win. So the only thing good is the Character customization, I spent 1 hour because there are too many selections. The bad thing is the optimization and the players....they hack eyy.  Im giving this a 6/10 :(
2052	0	a	Meh its just meh, its not good or bad just... meh. Its free so you can give it a try, i played 20h on â™¥â™¥â™¥ or smth like that. There are beter f2p games on steam like team fortress 2 or warframe.
2053	0	a	It's fun but
2054	0	a	After waiting for the game to download. I had to wait for another download which last around an hour every time i've tried to play. I havnt even been aple to play it yet, and i know its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. DO NOT GET IT!!!
2055	0	a	Don't recommend this game. Leave your account alone for a few years, and they'll ban you and delete support requests. Real 'gamers first' :) Good luck all.
2056	0	a	WTF why download from steam create an account on gamerfirst and download it again!! WHY?
2057	0	a	Complete Pay to win game. dont even bother
2058	0	a	it didnt work when i tried to download it, might as well kill myself. but this helped me.  http://www.wikihow.com/Tie-a-Noose   
2059	0	a	This game WAS worth consider playing, with gta-like elements and Wide range of customizations from clothing to vehicles and death themes and more .....but the pvp matchmaking is terrible AND with the type of weapons the devs allowed has made the type of 'fair game' disappeared. If you want to play this game with a much enjoyable mood then buying certain things from the game is recommended...I play it only if i have no games left to play.

2072	0	a	it was a good game, but was
2073	0	a	The game is always running and I can't even close â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing close it!
2074	0	a	THis game messes with your steam and makes steam think its running while it isn't.
2075	0	a	This game is utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.  Took two hours to install, with another installation not mentioned in the description... And then it denied my video card. I'm so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off with this game. I used to have this game on another PC, but when I reinstalled it on here I can't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing believe what I saw. Uninstall while you still can.
2076	0	a	Let me first say that I have several hundred hours from the sandalone version, so I've played more than the 7.9 on my account. The game is fun, it's sort of like a knockoff GTA. You can be a bad guy, rob shops and get into turf wars, do fun violent things, etc. The games biggest benefit, though, is the fact that you can also be a cop. Any cop players who see the criminal players doing bad stuff or doing missions can immediately intervene and **** them up, which makes for some good fun, and fighting real players as cops is a lot more fun than the crappy AI in games like GTA.  However, this game suffers immensely from it's pay-to-win tactics, through which you will dominate all other players if you have $20 to blow. The devs tout your ability to customize your character, despite the fact that if you want to place more than a few decals on your car or make an intricate design on your clothes you again have to pay money. Want one of the good guns? Give us money. Want to use said guns for more than a few days? MORE money. Want to get a decent car? ALL THE MONEY. You want to KEEP that car? Oh baby you know that's only allowed if you want to spend money. 'Wow our game is so cool and free-to-play.'  Honestly if they scrapped all the pay-to-win stuff and just charged $10-$20 for the game, this would be a fantastic game. The core features and physics are strong, the gameplay is fun when you're not being bulldozed by people with expendable income, and the game has tons of variety. But all of these strengths are shadowed by the money-grubbing nature of this game. Until they update to a new engine as they've been promising for a long time, and at least cut back on the pay-to-win features, this game is NOT worth playing.   In my opinion, the devs should just design the game again from the ground up with a new engine and release it as a seperate game at a reasonable price. There's no excuse to not do that.
2077	0	a	The connection is awful
2078	0	a	This game blows it has graphic issues and th gamplay is just horrible why doesnt someone just take this off of steam.   -10/10-BLOWS

2081	0	a	This game is kind of like gta except you can be a cop if you choose too it is not fun but its worth the install. it dont realy think its a very awesome game theres not much to do and everyone just goes of and does what ever the hell they want  Review 5/10  Rating Ma15 us i dont know eu rating pegi 18
2082	0	a	The game was extremely fun but it ruined my computer and caused it to freeze a lot. im pretty sure it gave it a bug but if you dont have this problem then yeah get it but i had to delete it and it took several weeks for it to get back to normal
2083	0	a	The game was fun while it lasted, arresting people, clan war all that stuff was fun, however, two things ruined it; One, the game became very pay to win. I mean, you could play and still kill SOME people, but if someone has a gun that cost 3.99 and you've got your little peashooter, you're dead meat.  Two, and this is the main thing, and if it gets fixed, I'll come back to playing it, and I may be tempted to pay some money, but this really isn't easy to fix. Here goes: The game has a few servers, one for newbies, one for casuals, and one for veterans. The problem is that casuals and veterans will repeatedly get themselves killed to lower their rank, and then they gang up on the newbies. Yes, people are that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. They think their big and bad when they do that, and they call everybody 'Noob!' and think they're good.  Overall, I think the game is really awesome, but until they find a way to keep veterans away from the casuals and newbies, the game is unplayable. You can't even get better, because you're litteraly dead within seconds.
2084	0	a	This game is horrible because there servers lag and there game lags for no reason with the best ping.There moderators are trolls i played the game for 3 hours then a moderator bans me permanantly for no apparent reason i didnt get and email of why i got banned i didnt do anything wrong.
2085	0	a	Love the idea of this game. What I don't like is that it feels like playing counter strike. Everyone spends their time jumping up and down to avoid bullets. And the initial load up procedure is horrible.
2086	0	a	the pay to win element is cancer
2087	0	a	Horrible
2088	0	a	Bad controlls, physics are terrible, pace is sloooowwwwww and the game is a 'PAY TO WIN' game. I knew there would be a reason why it was free so I dont know what I was thinking....
2089	0	a	this game sucks enough said
2090	0	a	its piece of crap on a stick
2091	0	a	when it first came out i loved it, though i could only run it on 10 fps., now several years later with a new pc i tried it agian, and i have never been so disapointet... when you are new to the game you join pvp games where your teammates are just as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as you are, but your opponents is insanely high rank and ofc. also pay to win so even if you snipe them 5 times in head before they even see you, they just turn around and instagib you with ump or a handgun. so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing broken because of some greedy developers!
2092	0	a	I have played a long while without steam since close Beta, all G1 gamers are friendly and F2P.   Till 2013, P2W became hot topic in this game and i totally AGREE those people who invest a lot of MONEY in this game can have HIGH CHANCE TO WIN,  That trigged gamers (most of them are UNMATURE KIDS) tried to use with HACK PROGRAMMES for tricking G1 points and gaming that happened on 3 servers(EU, NA, HK). [Check youtube please, Gamerfirst]  The threat system became a joke for me. FAKE GOLD, HACKER CLAN.  I believe people will change, and game as well,  but it have become worst than what gamers should EXPERIENCE( ENJOYMENT, EXCITMENT and TEAMWORK).  Im sick of the communty with hackers and team killers.  Please someone help this game.

2120	0	a	stay away from apb, unless you're a masochistic.
2121	0	a	This game isnt bad but there are alot of hackers and not very fun when the game is free to play but its pay to win
2122	0	a	What a clunky, frustrating, and really boring game. Since the game began, there have only been 2 core city maps. Decent sizes but full of really boring and useless things to do. So you do missions endlessly. Now to the game's credit, when you get two teams who are equally balanced and moderately competent, it can be fun. Those moments reminded me of Saints Row 2 multiplayer (RIP). But the method to aquire clothing and guns is such a disgusting grind of blah. The car physics and driving camera are both awful to deal with. The guns are not balanced in the least. The power levels of players and matchmaking is not balanced in the least. Newbs can expect to be the whipping boy for anyone with a decent modded weapon, abilities, and upgrades. THose players get the same for killing a weak newbs as they do an equally matched player... so who do you think they go after all the time? No wonder the game died. There is zero evidence of any kind of non-cosmetic content since launch. The game allows rampant abuses, and creates them with a lack of proper matchmaking, leveled areas, or any mechanism to balance the game in any way.  Go play GTA5 multi... it's vastly superior. APB was an ok idea that set the bar really low for itself and didnt do anything to raise it. The game is still kind of active but new players were constantly being discouraged and leaving due to the buzzards who quite obviously flaunted their unfair advantages at every turn.  Oh wait... APB doesnt care. If you want to actually not get wrecked and not spend 6 months grinding incredibly stupid unlocks you give them money. It's free toplay. No surprises. But it's been out for 8 years. And the level of content available is so insanly limited... oh wait no there are a ton of clothing and ca options if you want to grind it out or pay up... but the gameplayu is still lame, shallow, and lacking any kind of meaningful substance. It blows.  So if you think it looks kind of fun, it can be for a little while until you see all the things that are wrong with it. Then you will wake up and say 'Why am I wasting my time with this when it's 2016 and there are vastly superior but similar experiences to have?'

2145	0	a	Not really good. I thought this was going to be like a gta but foer pc and free. it is. the aspects are great but i find the game unplayable due to the fact that it takes a second for the game to register that you pressed a button.
2146	0	a	I would call this game Pay to Win. Argue if you want, but it's a multiplayer PVP game for the most part and you can buy cooldowns, permanent weapons ( some with exclusive mods, ) 2.25 times more cash gains etc...  You can buy pretty much everything permanently with real money right off the bat, be it cars, weapons, etc. If you want to be 100% Free to Play, be ready to spend tons of gold on 10-days lasting weapons. You will have to gather money for days to get one permanent weapon, only if someone is selling one on the Marketplace. The community is terrible, there's many bugs, random downtimes which cancel your missions and you lose the rewards you would have gotten for that misson. Also you can slaughter the whole city and be unnoticed, but be wary that breaking a store window by mistake, not even stealing anything and the other players playing enforcers can arrest you and steal all the money you have on you!  Also the matchmaking is terrible, sometimes you get matched with 2 other silvers and you have to face 3 golds. Your whole team could be rank 20 and you play against rank 200+ which have more mods, better cars, knows the game more and have better weapons. You have ''Bronze, Silver and Gold'' servers, but they're full of golds who like to pwn noobs either way. Only the leader can call for backup and people go AFK randomly pretty often.  Also, if your team leader ( which seems to be random because 90% of the time I join a mission I am not the leader, ) decides that he dosen't like you, he can kick you right before the mission ends to make you lose all the money and experience you would've gotten. He can also kick you just because you killed him by mistake, just because you sprayed a tag before him or even because you are MVP and he wants to be MVP instead!  The good? It's probably one of the only MMO that looks like GTA and Saints Row. The graphics are ok and the game has alot of content. Sadly, it's not a game I would play more than I already did after noticing all the flaws it has.  Here's the benefit of premium ( forums says it's 12.50$ per month: )  Around 90% bonus to all Contact XP gains. +125% bonus cash gain ( Instead of 500$ for a mission you would gain 1125$. ) 20% discount on the Armas Marketplace ( Real money marketplace. ) 50% shorter cooldown on abilities like Field supplier, Nitro booster, etc. ) Deeper Customization (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing items, 100 layers per Symbol. ) Removal of Subscription ADS ( which appears at the end of all missions. ) Armas Trials for weapons and vehicles last 3 hours instead of 30 minutes ( which makes using the 200~ trials, 6 times more effectively. )

2154	0	a	I remember playing this game when it first came out. Didn't like it then because the controls were a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥, couldn't summon my vehicle, couldn't remove items from my locker and place them in my inventory. EVEN IN AN AMMO ZONE!  Thought hey I'll quit playing this pos and take my clan with me and MAYBE, just MAYBE when when we come back, the developers will have fixed the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t controls. Nope.  Developers still haven't developed a temporary spawn for players spawning in on either team. Still have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ campers they immediatly put you in a crossfire or run your over almost immediatly as you spawn back in.  All in all. This game is still extremely poorly balanced apparently will never be fixed, even with the Pay-2-Win gamers it attracts. I miss the this game, but it isn't worth the time or effort.

2158	0	a	You'll only enjoy this game if your good. Other than that its a rage fest. Its not a pay to win, but as I said you need skill to enjoy the game or win it. Other than that the customization is amazing, but you need premium to put more than 5 decals on a car, 25 decals in an emblem, or 5 decals on clothing. The matchmaking is a complete mess, new people will really have a hard time when they get matched up with veterans...  I only recommend this game if you have the patience to die a lot.
2159	0	a	GAME IS JUST WAY TO OVERRATED .JUST A CRAPY EXAMPLE OF COMPANYS FAILS TO CREATE SOMTHING NEW RATHER THAN TRING TO MAKE IT ANOTHER GTA UNISTALL THIS GAME WHILE YOU CAN IT WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND SPACE WELL IF YOU DONT CHEW BIG RED THEN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU..LOL
2160	0	a	This is a game where cash is king, and not in game cash, I mean real cash, I dont want to spend big bucks for better weaponry and cars, this game would be good if it wasnt this way and the dlc was less pricey more guns were available ingame,same with cars, and a easy to understand tutorial too
2161	0	a	I absolutley..............hate this game. In order to get a weapon that is actually good and you can keep it forever you have to spend real money to get this thing called 'G1C' or 'Gamer 1 Cash.' In order to get the gun I want i have to spend $50. And yes thats really not that much but I could buy a completely different better game exactly like this. Lower your prices and Ill play more often.

2173	0	a	Games trash. Not worth any time, pay to win
2174	0	a	Don't bother with this game.  There may have been a time when this was a fun title back when it first came out. That ship has sadly set sail unfortunately.  Having played this game both before and after it hit steam, it hasn't made enough changes to the formula to really be worth your time unless you are looking for excuses to break your keyboard/PC in a fit of rage.  The teams for missions/combat are hopelessly unbalanced 4 times out of 5. With rookies/new players often taking up 3 of the 4 players while the other team is full of players with 800+ hours whom know every in and out of the maps. Whom have the best gear and customized vehicles and clothes money can buy (both with in game currency and microtransactions).  The vehicles handle like garbage. If you have even the slightest lag whilst playing this game may god have mercy on your car's steering, the game will not.  The ONLY reason I would suggest even remotely looking at this game is for it's customization. I have never seen a game that lets you get so detailed with everything from each article of clothing, to the decals on your car to even the soundtrack that plays for someone when you kill them.  -pi/10, would rather get in a fist-fight with pack of half-starved hyenas
2175	0	a	If you dont have good mouse, mouse pad, sensitivity, good nerves , then this game is not recommended for you. This game can turn you into nervewreck.  Not recommending. -Got killed by a grenade which blew up on the other side of the wall. -Was driving at enemy, he shot with bazooka at me, I blew up, car flew and dropped on top of him, he survived. -If you sit on top of grenade when it exploads, you dont die unless you on low health. -Veterans whining about hackers in district chat when they lose, while they act ruthless against beginners/noobs. -Bad matchmaking. Beginners are putten against veterans. Matches might end up 0 kills on one side and 20 kills on other. -Rating system. You gain better weapons as you play this game and become better, giving you ever more easier way to kill beginners. -No reward if you did your best but failed. Some matches you might end up playing 5-10min and gain nothing. -Players can drive on top of other people cars. Like what the hell. -Players can jump over cars that are driving towards them. Again, what the hell. -Lack of shooting or dodging tutorials. There are moments when you waste entire clip on enemy while for him it takes only 5 bullets to kill you. Veteran basically jumps around doing zig zag dance, dodging your bullets, even if he takes hit, there is no pentalty for him. -This is too fast paced with no penalty when taking hit. -Fast regenerating health. -Pay to win. You can buy premium guns.

In short over priced shop and game is dead, ive spent plenty of hours and money on it and i dont recommend you waiste your time at all.
2183	0	a	played this game for a short while was not impressed at all, lame in game physics crappy car control even worse char control  missions consist of shoot other players...... (which other players will undoubtly own you as they are completely unbalanced matches) out of missions gameplay consists of do even more lame stuff to earn cash to get items   has potential but dont download unless your so incrediably board   also its data hog burns data constantly wheather you standing still or doing stuff  in less than an hour it used over 50 megs  in just over an hour used over 100 megs
2184	0	a	This game basically needs a bit of cash splashed onto it to work. its a good f2p game but, you need to pay money to get good guns to do good. using the in-game currency to buy perma-guns would be nice. This game handles itself strangely. pay like 35 in-game credits for a permanant clothing item but pay 1300 credits for a leased gun. The artwork that people post for this game looks nice.  A remake (or sequel) would be nice (if there was no need to pay real money). Hit detection can be S.H.I.T but if you pay like 100 usd to buy a SINGLE permanent gun you won't have a problem. And as RELOADED ENT. are money â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s they sell in THE CASH SHOP leased guns. LIKE WTF. don't play until it gets made better.

2189	0	a	Hi all, this game is so much fun But there are Cheaters that have aim bot, speed run , more heal or infinete heal and gun speed shoot. yeas it fun but anty cheat thes not worck and can even report a cheater in game .
2190	0	a	This game is enjoyable, even with the latency issues and frequent hackuzations running around in district chat. I have played over 1,500 hours over several characters (I played since beta, when it wasn't on steam). I loved this game, I really did, but I can't recommend it.  First, the good, the things that just make it fun!  This game is fun! Open world gameplay PVP-ing against the opposing faction (you choose Enforcer or Criminal when you create your character).  Amazing customization. When I first started, I spent so long in character customization that I timed out. I've created some sweet mechanical-looking sleeve tatoos (I need to look mechanical/cybernetic somehow to keep up with my name). Vehicle customization is pretty decent as well. With parts you can buy for G1C and decals you can paint your ride with, you can create a unique ride that will stand out whenever you drive it around town.  Open world. The missions, though fairly repetetive after playing for a long time, are fun when you can come from many different streets or rooftops to attack the point. When not running missions, it's fun to hunt bounties that pop up (bounties are players who have attained level 5 notoriety/prestiege from completing objectives and killing opposing players).  But the reasons I can't recommend it?  Bad devs. Any game glitches, game breaking or not, are not fixed in a timely manner. At times, it will take weeks to fix even fairly small issues. Weapon balance issues are huge. They tweak the TTK for weapons, and now have a district just for testing out new adjustments, which is a good step forward. Despite this, they still have problems.  Bad mods. There are many, many 'fishy' players here, In my 1,500+ hours I have learned to distinguish legitimately good players from 'too good' players. Many blatant hackers which have stuck around for a long time, and have not yet been banned. Oh, and don't think you're safe from the mods even if you don't hack (or spend a fair amount of G1C-premium currency). I have had legitimate friends (who I can guarantee do not hack) be banned for 'hacking.' The support team does not listen, and will ignore your pleads for review.  The final.  If you do decide to play this game, I'd recommend remaining a completely free player, or buying very small amounts of G1C. Remembering that you can loose everything you've put into the game, even if you do nothing wrong. It's great fun with a group of 3 other friends, but you may get frustrated with running into blatant hackers when you want to just enjoy yourself.

2201	0	a	i cant really say if i can recommend this game...press play then it goes to the loading screen then the loading screen goes away and nothing...hard for me to say weather or not I like it or not
2202	0	a	6 gb of loading screen,bugs and pay2win i coundnt even play the game, i tried 4 times nothing so if you like loading screens this game is for you
2203	0	a	I have just downloaded the game, and i can't even create a character before i get disconnected. I't keeps saying it might be connection error, but that can't be it because i can play all other online games without any problems with connection.
2204	0	a	At first I didn't read the below comments to make sure I was unbiased when trying out this game. But then I realized how fun and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game is at the same time. Furthermore I hated the sheer verticalality of some weapon tiers in combat scenarios. In the end, after getting stomped by gold threat players with weapons that were far superior than the no-mod , non-arma - defualt weapon, I just gave up.   Fun game. But overall a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  The guns that aren't immediately available to new players take a alot of time and effort to grind. The same guns also would've made the experience for a new player more tolerable if they had the same firepower than many cash-cows were throwing into the game. This stratification of gear implied by contractor levels and real-money spent make a new player's experience hell. The fact that you can easily bypass the contract level purchase requirements though the ARMA store to access even better versions of the same weapon you grind for is only a hint of pay to win, in the fact that you can just straight up buy the best weapons for every combat scenario.  Missions are Repetitive, and more often than not an Defensive team will be almost impenetrable. Even though an offending team can split up and flank, the defending team has less area to cover and thus has multiple lines of sight to each other and to the invading team as well.  Cash Shop is very expensive. $5+ dollars for a 30 day rental, 25 dollars for a permanent weapon. Don't even begin on the cars. The quaity of your car lends itself to how troll you can be when you decide to take a package holdout mission and you drive around with said package.  Even BLR has a permanent weapon purchase mechanic, and that game has it's own share of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ problems.  In hindsight, don't play this game unless you have tons of cash to throw around for OP guns and fast cars. One of the most expensive f2p games I've ever seen.
2205	0	a	you will be constantly fixing it while the reward isnt to great (gta clone) as it disintagrates the entire computer

2216	0	a	APB... a P2W game where losers who don't have any skill in games gather to buy weapons that give them advantage so that they can feel a little bit better about themself when they destroy someone with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pistol/smg in few hits... that about sums it all up i guess, nothing else needs to be said about this game besides it not being worth your time, don't worther downloading it because you will be disappointed very quickly and you will regret ever being born into a world where this game exists, id rather watch my windows update itself rather than play this game.
2217	0	a	this is a bad game. buy gtav idiot.

2223	0	a	Great Game  But  So many cheaters...
2224	0	a	This game WAS worth consider playing, with gta-like elements and Wide range of customizations from clothing to vehicles and death themes and more .....but the pvp matchmaking is terrible AND with the type of weapons the devs allowed has made the type of 'fair game' disappeared. If you want to play this game with a much enjoyable mood then buying certain things from the game is recommended...I play it only if i have no games left to play.
2225	0	a	Bring back the old APB.
2226	0	a	The cops should be bots.
2227	0	a	i cant get the dang thing to load :( 
2228	0	a	is this even a game
2229	0	a	  I've played League of Legends and its community isn't as toxic as APB's community. Download this game if you're rich and want to spend a hella ton of money on this game, if you're not then you're better off downloading another game.  Sure this game can be fun but there's always a gold player that's going to anally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you with his grenades and cars.  But if you ignore all its faults and its rabid and toxic community, APB is a good game that is worth your while. Even if it's for a little bit.
2230	0	a	  I've played this game hundreds of hours off Steam, and the only valid reason this would still be a playable game is for the nostalgia. Really, it used to be a great game with an intresting concept, BUT NAH! Let's make it pay-to-win! I wouldn't waste more time on this than I already have.  Matchmaking: You're bronze rating? Cool, we're gonna match you with gold players at lvl 255, sure. And they're not even gold players themselves, they're just some rich kiddos with aimbot.  Updates: Well, tons of updates. Every week a new weapon. Which you have to pay for like 15$ or buy it on the in-game market for 2 million game cash., which you can grind in about 3 months. Without premium, that is. Buy premium and it's in 1.5 months. Boom.  Physics: If San Paro was a real place, it wouldn't really be in our universe. Strange things happen, I tell ya. The vehicle physics are little said funny. There's just so many things you can do with 2 cars, and then there's the Vegas 4x4. It used to be a premium-only car, but then they added a refferal system so if you play with friends you get points, and if you gather enough you can get it for free. That thing is so overpowered, you can literally land on rooftops with it, also add a Nitro 3 mod just for the fun of it :D The character physics can be frustrating sometimes, and the interactive objects like doors and ladders aren't of any good. Hey, this game has something good, at least!  Customization: This is where the real pro of the game is at. They say. But in reality, you can add, umm, a few decals that you can make yourself by using only boring shapes and stuff, and yeah. BUT HEY, BUY PREMIUM AND YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 100 DECALS ON YOUR CAR! Isn't that just great! Well no, it isn't if you don't wanna spend money on this.  Overall, this game is fun for some weeks to mess around with a friend, but otherwise don't waste your time.  AND THE TROLLS, MAN! SO MANY TEAMKILLERS AND NOOBS!
2231	0	a	This game doesn't load, it put a virus on my computer, and I spent literally 10 HOURS waiting for this to download hoping I could get some fun out of this game.I would only recomend this game if you have a TON of other things to do while it downloads There is one more thing you HAVE to have for this game to work, a really,really strong computer.
2232	0	a	First to start off I played 14 hours of this game and let me tell you IT ISNT FOR EVERYONE! The game has a weird learning curve but anyone who is good can beat p2w players. The game in my opinion is not recommended for the casual gamer of for someone who can buy gta 5 seriously this game is awful its just a game that I wish the devs got hernias.

2244	0	a	GTA for poor people  Pros -... -Riddled with hackers yet not as many as GTA V currently has?  Cons -Pay to win -Extremely boring -Toxic community -Only way to make the real cash is by either paying for it or by playing a hundred PvP missions, or a thousand PvE missions, it's like you're getting punished for not wanting to play against other players, which is extremely dull. -All the cars are basically one big hitbox, you can't shoot people through car windows and the top speed is basically the same for all vehicles. And if you want to customize your character or vehicles to a higher extent you need to pay real money for PREMIUM.  To sum it up. It's dull as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

2261	0	a	I enjoyed the look of this game, I engoyed the feel of this game. But it's marketplace is got to be the worst part of the game. I bought some clothes with in-game currency, bought ammo with in-game currency, but you have to buy weapons with real money? This is possible the best example of Pay-2-Win. Everything that does nothing but improve look is free but everything that improves combat effectiveness is must be payed for.

Stop trying to make a GTA and get a life. if i cant make yawspeed, what is life? i cant 360 just by pressing Q? WTF! This is the worst. @FaZeRain @FaZeAdapt @FaZeApex @FaZe Banks @Faze Blaziken. I hope that this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on in 2 hours.

2273	0	a	This game basically needs a bit of cash splashed onto it to work. its a good f2p game but, you need to pay money to get good guns to do good. using the in-game currency to buy perma-guns would be nice. This game handles itself strangely. pay like 35 in-game credits for a permanant clothing item but pay 1300 credits for a leased gun. The artwork that people post for this game looks nice.  A remake (or sequel) would be nice (if there was no need to pay real money). Hit detection can be S.H.I.T but if you pay like 100 usd to buy a SINGLE permanent gun you won't have a problem.

2274	0	a	Not only did I have to start off the game using a crap gun class I would never use and I'm not good at, the typical assault rifle. But the tutorial did not explain anything about how to get new weapon classes and the playerbase were just a bunch of trolls who said 'go play cod' or 'get good' I would flank up on an enemy, start firing at him first and not miss any shots only to have him turn around and kill me instantly. The vehichle physics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, flipping your car over and I found myself killed by random players outside of missions constantly.  Worst game I've ever played, worst community, worst mechanics, worst options for character customisation (at the start of the game) ever.

2279	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. i know this review was harsh but never for the love of god play it 
2280	0	a	Words cnat even describe how pay to win this is, but I can try.  First off it is important to note that the 'tutorial' the game gives you is little mpore than some stuff that you need to do, but it doesnt really say how and while you do it, your not in a seperate part of the game like most mmo's, no you are in the game, with no clue what to do.   Expect to have to pay a lot of gold to get anything in this game, although some cheap weapons are decent, the only last for 7 days, that is right, you have to buy new weapons every 7 days. Anything that is permanent like guns or cars, will cost you lots of money.  The whole G1C thing really ticks me off, its a premium currency used that you have to buy, (or earn in painfullly small amounts) that can buy the best of everything.   Matchmaking is broken, new players vs old, 5 v 2, etc   Story is almost nothing, imagine a quilt with 5 patches that are decnt looking, but they are all spread apart and sewn together using a dark brown thread that makes it look ugly.  Honestly, when i got this game, i saw the bad reviews and thought 'Whatver, this game looks awesoeme!', and even though i started with no expectations, somehow, this bundle of steaming horse crap has gone below my lowest expectations. Do not play this game, please, just trust me.  Overall -10/10
2281	0	a	tried it out for a couple of minutes. didnt really like it.
2282	0	a	.
2283	0	a	It's meh, i've come to realize at this point this game largely filled with the aspect of P2W which is basically you buy premium and get a bonus of 100% for everything along with that hackers are known and don't get dealt with. So far i've sent in three support tickets with suspected cheaters and gave clear images along with links with there emails and names tied to hacking sites that confirm that they do pay for cheats for atleast another game at the best.   They've responded to one and still haven't replied with any others, the support ticket I was responded was a giant robotic reply which basically is summed up as the TLDR version; 'We will look into the matter, however we can't tell you anything about the player due to privacy concerns, etc, etc'. It's been 48 hours now and hes been hackusated by a entire server and multiple people accuse him of speedhacking which he abused along with his aimbot.  The P2W aspect is that for a meesly $5 you can get a Perm gun of four choices that are usually really good and do indeed own the free versions, you get a free car which is also nice along with 500 G1C credits and 31 days of membership. With that you've basically made it so you're going to outlevel normal players by atleast 60% faster and don't have to waste your money on guns and cars early rather saving up and being able to purchase the end-games guns and cars soon as they're unlocked for you. However the most P2W element is the Arma weapons themself due the fact you're able to purchase much stronger versions of the F2P guns at much lower ranks along with having unique perks such as silencers, better modifiers, etc.

2298	0	a	would be good if it could start 10/10 
2299	0	a	The game was fun while it lasted, arresting people, clan war all that stuff was fun, however, two things ruined it; One, the game became very pay to win. I mean, you could play and still kill SOME people, but if someone has a gun that cost 3.99 and you've got your little peashooter, you're dead meat.  Two, and this is the main thing, and if it gets fixed, I'll come back to playing it, and I may be tempted to pay some money, but this really isn't easy to fix. Here goes: The game has a few servers, one for newbies, one for casuals, and one for veterans. The problem is that casuals and veterans will repeatedly get themselves killed to lower their rank, and then they gang up on the newbies. Yes, people are that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. They think their big and bad when they do that, and they call everybody 'Noob!' and think they're good.  Overall, I think the game is really awesome, but until they find a way to keep veterans away from the casuals and newbies, the game is unplayable. You can't even get better, because you're litteraly dead within seconds.

2305	0	a	What a clunky, frustrating, and really boring game. Since the game began, there have only been 2 core city maps. Decent sizes but full of really boring and useless things to do. So you do missions endlessly. Now to the game's credit, when you get two teams who are equally balanced and moderately competent, it can be fun. Those moments reminded me of Saints Row 2 multiplayer (RIP). But the method to aquire clothing and guns is such a disgusting grind of blah. The car physics and driving camera are both awful to deal with. The guns are not balanced in the least. The power levels of players and matchmaking is not balanced in the least. Newbs can expect to be the whipping boy for anyone with a decent modded weapon, abilities, and upgrades. THose players get the same for killing a weak newbs as they do an equally matched player... so who do you think they go after all the time? No wonder the game died. There is zero evidence of any kind of non-cosmetic content since launch. The game allows rampant abuses, and creates them with a lack of proper matchmaking, leveled areas, or any mechanism to balance the game in any way.  Go play GTA5 multi... it's vastly superior. APB was an ok idea that set the bar really low for itself and didnt do anything to raise it. The game is still kind of active but new players were constantly being discouraged and leaving due to the buzzards who quite obviously flaunted their unfair advantages at every turn.  Oh wait... APB doesnt care. If you want to actually not get wrecked and not spend 6 months grinding incredibly stupid unlocks you give them money. It's free toplay. No surprises. But it's been out for 8 years. And the level of content available is so insanly limited... oh wait no there are a ton of clothing and ca options if you want to grind it out or pay up... but the gameplayu is still lame, shallow, and lacking any kind of meaningful substance. It blows.  So if you think it looks kind of fun, it can be for a little while until you see all the things that are wrong with it. Then you will wake up and say 'Why am I wasting my time with this when it's 2016 and there are vastly superior but similar experiences to have?'
2306	0	a	This game isnt bad but there are alot of hackers and not very fun when the game is free to play but its pay to win

2311	0	a	This game is such a joke its almost hilarious. Like a gta iv mod of a mod.
2312	0	a	its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
2313	0	a	I accidentally modded my gta v and this game poped up in my library, I don't know what happened but the graphics now looks garbage, controls feels like if my character is having a hangover, now hearing 10 years olds screaming in my ears and insisting that he screwed my mom last night. DO NOT MOD gta v! I repeat.
2314	0	a	As much as this game has provided me in endless hours of customization and havok-wreaking fun, it has provided me with double the amount of time wondering how a game with so much potential can be so.....broken. From the rampant cheaters to the lack of proper servers the game can be extraordinarily frustrating at times. The game it self is a Cops and Robbers themed MMO, a concept which could have been executed bery well but just seems to fall short in almost every area except for customization. If there is one positive thing that I can say about APB it is the detail and level of customization is astounding and can have even the most uncreative of people tapping into their wild side. This is also the major flaw of the game, as most of the money for development was spent in the Customization Programs.  All in all, this game can be fun at times, but will overall not be worth the time you put into it 5/10
2315	0	a	- Game is exploitable and allows you to win simply because you utilized the dirtiest tricks. The rage when doing this is gold, though. - Matchmaking sucks. Time to take out the stun guns. - Weapon balance sucks. Just use OP weapons all day, every day. Bam. Win streaks. - The servers are so bad, combat looks like a DB:Z fight. - The game will lag no matter how good your PC is. - There's like 100,000 players that play around 2 - 3 days a week, and 15,000 that play over 3 days a week. 1,200 of those are cheating. - You would be better off selling your soul to Satan.
2316	0	a	I played this game for about a month (Don't mind the little play time on my steam account) and i can say this. Hackers everywhere, their servers are laggy as hell and with every update it gets worse. Next is the p2w thingy... If you are new to this game and don't want to spend any money on in than don't even bother playing it....  Edit 2015-06-12: Lags, Lags everywhere...
2317	0	a	Apb is a good game and fun I put more that 70$ on the game But today apb gave me account block or in other words, banned I never done cheats on the game  I never scam or anything els This week i got 4 permanent guns from joker boxes and now every thing that i put on the game is in the creators money and more that 600 hours  Was nice to play apb alot but im rly  Disappointed from the game...
2318	0	a	Can't even start the game
2319	0	a	Poor optimization
2320	0	a	This game has a lot of pros it's true.. But sadly to access those pros you will need to pay. A LOT. The customization from this game is incredibile you can make your car or character look exactly how you want it to look. But you need to pay for different bodykits for cars, or better clothes, or more space to add symbols on those things. If you are happy with a stock car and a simple outfit go for it but after that you will be surprised how much you can hate this game.. Always getting matched against more experienced opponents or players with premium weapons that are too overpowered to be killed. Seriously, those who can actually spend money on a game like this will get all the good stuff, giving new players reasons to not play this unfinished game. I guess the worst part of this game is the company that is curently developing it. This game is pay 2 win. If you want to try it, go for it but you will need a large wallet to play properly. Enjoy.
2321	0	a	It's hard to really express how bad this is. Let's create a scenario: You just got in the game. You get a basic rifle and pistol. The game does little to tell you what to do and where to go. Instantly, other players murder you, because you're on a mission and all of APB is PVP. You finally figure out what to do.  Know what you find? You find the most boring weapon physics ever created. You find that elite items make all the difference between win and lose. You find a player base of suburban kids that love 'gang banging' vs. Neckbeard cop wannabes that drop money on elite items. This is GTA without the fun and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ player names attached to an even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ier player base.   Skip on this one for your sake. Just get Saint's Row 3.
2322	0	a	Its an awful awful game. Imagine World of Warcraft meets GTA. Except they added a bunch of WoW grinding and removed the fun from GTA.

G1 have totally killed APB and turned it in to nothing more than a cash cow.  I will never play this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ again.  Makes me feel sick that i supported this bunch of crooks.

2341	0	a	APB Realoaded...okay here have a look at this first: The Pros -Character customazation i guess? Well its pretty good. -You Get to choose what faction you want to be. Well that's a pretty good add since most games are like 'OH HEY UR A GUD GUY WIT SUCKISH CLOTHS!' -Cars. Yeah that's awesome. Annddd...That's it. The Cons -Pay To Win. Yeah we all died from a person with an OP gun in this game, because wasting money on a free game is a good idea. -No new game modes. -The Fact you have to have a monster PC to run this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Hey i managed to run Far Cry 3 and Payday 2 before why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ does this lag so much?  -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community. Wow everywhere i go someone is like 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you im better then you' i tried asking help to get started and the awnser is 'Learn that yourself you dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'.   4/10 Dont waste your time and Computer Space on this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2342	0	a	Would be fun if balanced, but its not.  Pros: Its pretty almost like GTA, and you can drive a car YAY! And also pay money to look like, well a bunny, or something stupid like that. Thats it... Cons: Why a bunny? Because nearly every firefight ends with you being bunny hopped at close range. How many seats does the car have? WHY would that matter if you can simply ride on TOP of the car? Shooting at a car is fairly useless, tires dont blow out. Driver cant be killed unless they exit the car. You can then just bunny hop on them. The whole game is build around buying stuff on their annoying marketplace. Why give the player a choice of 5 FREE GUNS for 10 days, if they can simply go to the marketplace and try a BETTER gun for free for a day, theres more then 10 to choose from. The NPCs are useless. The only missions you do are random ones by selecting READY, that is not an RPG. Servers are unbalanced. Guns unbalanced. Half the time getting into your OWN car takes over 3 seconds. People shoot a grenade at your feet and arrest you, and you can do nothing. You play for 10 seconds, and then wait 30 seconds to respawn. There is no teamwork at all, just rushing the enemy 'beach of normandy style' till they die from being overwhelmed. Loading time is HORRIBLE, connecting to server takes forever, just to find out that there is only 3 people there and you need 4 to play. Weapons are kinda sad, lots of choices but are basiclly the same, you buy ammo manualy, cuz they gotta drain your in game money on something I guess. Thanks a lot. Sorry im tired of typing...

2358	0	a	Call me hard to please, but this game was stupid. I spent half an hour standing around shooting at things and breaking store fronts but had no clue where to drop off the TV's I stole. Also, you have NO CHOICE but to be thrown into a team and HAVE to complete objectives with people you dont even know. I HATE that. I want to roam free doing my own thing, not pair up with some dude who's already screaming his lungs out because 'everyone on the server sucks'  More team based crap full of elitist players who just SCREAM or talk crap. Skip this if you're looking for an open world game with lots to do.
2359	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I have ever let my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-observing eyes lay upon.   1. I've gotten up to 400 hours on this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 2. It's absolutley all pay to win. You have no-lifes who pay 50$ to use overpowered guns that only last 14 days, along with Premium and money bought perks and cars.  3. They banned me for wearing a swatzika, and I was not notified, and apparently it was 'offensive' yet, they say they don't ban for symbolism. (The Customer Support is absolutley â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the fact that they gave me an equivilent punishment to whawt they give hackers and cheaters). 4. The maps are absolutley stale and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ boring. You'll be wandering around a lifeless city going up to windows and doors clicking F, picking up items, go to zone A and B, defend for your entire experience.  5. Customization is extremley limited due to 'Premium', in which you can barely create and symbols, and customize your cars and character. 6. Again, you have to repay for a gun every 14 days, which mean constant, brainless grinding of cash for another â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gun that is about the same as all other guns unless you pull out your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wallet and throw money at these money â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s. 7. The game is extremley outdated with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics, gameplay, and is just so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stale.  8. The people who dedicate themselves to this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ just throw money at their screens, thats it. 9. Gamersfirst has taken no effort to revive the stale experience of this game, instead of years to improve a stale piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing died until they had to 'Reload' it up, nothing has changed, except a woopty-doo 'SERVER-MERGE' YAY. 10. Its hypocritical- You have adult players wearing inapropriate â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and half naked all the time, yet when a 'swatzika' is spotted, they PERMA-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING-BAN-YOU. 11. The driving mechanics are stale as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and boring, just drive and shoot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es THATS ALL. 12. PVP combat is as stale as a piece of weat toast, its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing auto asist your aim and is just un logical and stupid.  13. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.
2360	0	a	Don't bother  Logged on yesterday, joined a team and went on a mission. Got shot by own team, they said 'pay to win' to me, then i quit. Don't bother if you arent going to spend, or your own team members will shoot you for no reason.

I missed some. -Bad updates (The game was better a few years back)Â¨ -Time limited items -Money grinding only gives 30 day items -Expensive DLCs (You are not EA!) -Bad textures -Bad matchmaking system -Money â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ devs -Pay to win And i could do that in ages. The point is.. dont waste your time and life on this. There is many way better games out there. Alot of you might disagre with me at some points. But its a review. This is what i think! (I played this a few years back and now i begun to play it again and never knew it  became that bad!   UPDATE!: I played the game to see if i could find more reasons the game SUCKS heres some.  -Even more Pay2Win -Expensive gear -Invinsible objects and doors -Bad servers -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Matchmaking -Only weapon and clothes updates -Expensive DLCs (They should be a fair price even if they weren't on sale)  Enjoy them..

2381	0	a	from the moment you install this game , one thing becomes clear , you can pay to win , you have to pay to win , did i mention that winning is for sale ?  on paper the concept is solid , cops and robbers , sounds fun right ? well its not exactly cops and robbers , the police faction is exactly the same as the criminal faction functionally speaking. you can run over pedestrains as a cop and no one gives a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. theres no stake here for fun , the combat is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and P2W , the cars arent fun to drive unless you grind like a korean , thats so will cave in, just say â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it and pay them. look just do yourself a favor and stay away from this one, trust me , i know i wish i had.
2382	0	a	Pay-2-Win laggy hackfest. Criminals are given an extremely large amount of bonuses and advantages over Enforcers, rendering Enforcer an almost unplayable faction in comparison. There are a number of guns that you can only purchase exclusively with cash that have a clear advantage over the free guns. Enforcers cannot get all vehicles, whereas Criminals can. Criminals are able to gain more money, faster, have backup privilege, have biased missions where they can run off with the deliverable items, longer mission times for them to siege objectives, shorter mission times for them to defend objectives.  The game is dead.

2391	0	a	It's very pay to win in some aspects,but let me get the pros and cons sorted out here...  Pros: -It's fun at first when you're just goofin' around... -Kinda funny to look at glitchy vehicle system -Funnily bad in a lot of aspects such as Driving,Shooting,Threatening Civilians,Doing anything that leads to an 'animation' etc. -It's free (For the most part) Now onto what everyone wants to actually hear about...  Cons: -VERY pay to win -Lots of things in this 'open world' look very bland,lifeless,and boring. -Looks like a game from 2006-2007 -Has kinda bad optimization (even on a $1000 rig) -Bad hit boxes/hit detection -Pathetic AI -And much more i'm not willing to type :)
2392	0	a	This game is worse than giving birth to a fully sized man,everyone is generic fagot no.1 with a white wife beater on.The gun play is â™¥â™¥â™¥ cuz you have generic pea shooter one and some kid whop got his mothers paypal can one shot you with some 5 dollah gun.theres nothing to do in this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,after ten minutes of playing I was contemplating suicide.If you have no dollah and want to play something worse that rough anal with a door knop then I advice to try out this pay to win musical produced by the one and only steam free to play section.   P.S guns don't penetrate glass windows,players,nps,or your own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing skull once you try to end it all :( 7/11 Ign would un install again

I really liked the game, but even with many years of expierience in multiplayer shooters, if you don't pay real money for your equipment, including weapons, you're basically screwed. This is to my opinion the best example to show the great unbalance between Free2Play and Pay2Win gamers. No chance.  You'll lose the whole. damn. time. at every single mission and this takes the whole fun out of a basically good game.
2395	0	a	A Pay2Win game with a pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community to boot.
2396	0	a	It would not run well on my computer and constantly froze.
2397	0	a	Most Pay2Win game I've played.
2398	0	a	Do not install this geam. save your time. its a huge pay to win only . you cannot shoot anyone with ingame currency bought weapons.it hasnt changed in 5 years since the first company went bankrupt. piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2399	0	a	Noob game, so many hackers and they aren't banned, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game -.- Unistalling now
2400	0	a	It's fun when you ram raid, but missions aren't. Most of the time, you verse high ranking, high threat people, who tote OP Pay To Win weapons. There are also people who camp on streets and witness you doing a ram raid, and farm you for kills, stealing any money not taken to a Money Laundrey. Performance issues are a big problem, and no Australian servers, just Hong Kong NA East, West. This game has been revived by many companies and has recently got a new anti-hack system, but to be honest, it's not worth saving. 45%
2401	0	a	This game is basically the dictionary definition of pay-to-win. Not to mention the overwhelming population of hackers and 12 year old girls running around with stun guns. If you want to have a good time then it is in your best interest to click the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off this page and find another game.
2402	0	a	It's been 30 minutes and I haven't even made a character. This game sums up the worst of PC gaming; once downloaded through Steam, it opens another downloader. Once this downloader has downloaded the hacking detection software and updates, you can start the game (which uses way more ram than it should?). You can't play yet! You need to sign up to their website. Once signed in, pressing esc once on the menu takes you back to sign in again. Once signing in again, you get to the character creator which is extremely limited to non-payers.  The menu screens take twice as much power as Skyrim with an ENB. Menu screens, not even close to the high setting either.  After uninstalling the game, I had to uninstall the other stuff it runs in the background. I feel like I need to do a virus scan now.  Stick with Saints Row or GTA.  This is rubbish, not something I'd expect to see on Steam.
2403	0	a	He stole my car. He drove my car ( that I spent thousands of dollars customizing) into a ditch. My car exploded. He died. I quit.  9/11 community is toxic (10/10 for the uninstall button)
2404	0	a	this game looks good but its porly optimized so play it at you're won risk
2405	0	a	VERRY BORRING AND shity grafix....
2406	0	a	This game is a lot of fun specially with friends sadly this is a pay to win game.
2407	0	a	No, just no, just don't install it, it's a waste of time and space.
2408	0	a	P2W all the way! ourdated grahpics. lagg spikes if your using windows 10. &gt;.&gt;  i'm using 3.50 GHZ 8 GB ram 4 GB of grahpics memory 1 TB SSD
2409	0	a	this is amazing if you love third person shooter but this game really suck at graphics and gameplay isnt too bad ,car driving mechanics is tottaly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ , lots of hackers , matchmaking is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ur new? no ur pro so youll play with pro and get your nice butt kicked , making ur charr and symbols editing is not bad, but really this game worth a shot atleast , also you really need a friend to have , and this game is buggy as swamp full bugs ,lag, error codes also can anyone tell me how 2 fix error code 8? , and finally if youre really into mmofps i suggest you try this lack-of-stuff game maybe youll like it
2410	0	a	Arcade-style twitch fighting with random explosions similar to the beginning of any Call of Duty match. Repetitive, boring, and infuriating.  It does have awesome customization for both vehicles and characters, but overall the gameplay is terrible and antiquated.  3/10

2412	0	a	You can put swastikas on your car and block spawns with a garbage truck but the combat system sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ and there's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of premium. 2/5
2413	0	a	It sucks
2414	0	a	just buy GTA V  seriously
2415	0	a	only P2W, unfair enemies and cheaters !!! this is what I think about this game 0/10 or -10/10 :(
2416	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ freemium game.  That's all there is to say.
2417	0	a	Doesn't work. It keeps going into this update window but it never plays the actual game. Waste of time downloading this...
2418	0	a	do not buy this game it does not work
2419	0	a	This game is way too confusing. The hud is useless and overpacked. The maps are really small when compared to gta and such like. The posse system is really stupid and the fact that you cannot spot crimes in progress sucks. (There is a button to press like f4 or something, but that is glitched to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥). What else... Oh yeah, the community can be unfriendly. Thats the kicker. So I cannot say this game is fun, or I would be lying. Play something else, don't spend money on this game.
2420	0	a	The uninstall button works Thats the only thing thats works  
2421	0	a	Well, first of all... the game is great, the only problam is when I try to exit, and its a big problam. I have a computer with exactly the recommended system requierments but it still crashes... (blue screen /:)
2422	0	a	This game is too old need upgrade charaters,graphics and cars XD
2423	0	a	1 word. No its 3 words i think  PAY TO WIN
2424	0	a	JUST NO. Riddled with microtransaction. SUCKS BALLS. The pictures here are misleading. Horrible UI. JUST NO.
2425	0	a	Sadly, I cannot recommend this game. Hackers everywhere and so P2W avoid this game at all costs.
2426	0	a	Its a pretty average game at best. Its just a gta ripoff with bad graphics poor driving mechanics buggy af takes too long to load. its pretty fun for the first 10 minutes but just gets repetitive and boring. overly complicated and just glitchy. if you want to try a free poorly made version of gta san andreas then this is the game for you

2433	0	a	if u r not from usa then this game is a Sh it for ur country... awful lag... u wanna shoot someone? GUESS WHAT? U r already dead! my internet speed its not bad... i have played plenty of other games... where the lag wasnt an issue...
2434	0	a	so i think i'v played this game enough to give it a quick review (1250 hours if you wondering) so lets get started  i started to play this game about 3 years ago and it was fun (it is too now but not as it was back in a day) and then gamers first came in... they pretty much killed all the game potential...  i DO NOT recommend this game (play it at your own risk, i warned you) IF u have not played it before, why you probably ask, let me tell you why:  1. the community is toxic (do not even test it) 2. heavily P2W (put into this game 300$, and i 100% regret it) 3. this game updated 1 time in a year, and when they do update it, its a new P2W weapon 4. the engine in this game absolute crap (not even to mention that they soppused to upgrade the engine in 2013, they didnot even got it out after 3 years) 5. the physics are..... physics (witch mean they absolutely stupid, you've never seen this stupid, belive me) 6. the real cash items prieces are stupidly high ( lets say you want to put into this game 30$ witch is nice amount, you get only 2500G1C witch is the real cash game credits and you cannot even buy with that a simple bundle, you get the idea)  the only thing that i do recommend and i do like and want to be in other games is the design and the costumization level that this game have. so if you want to try this game for the game play, like i said its not recommended but if you want to try it for the costumization, i say so ahead. so the thing that i do recommend is below:  1. you can pretty much costumize everything in this game (due to the P2W level you got a limit for that and you need to buy premium if you wanna do really nice stuff) that inclodes: cars, clothes, kill theme (everytime you kill some it plays a music that you put) symbols 2. there is a ingame marketplace that the player can sell pretty much everything to other players  so, if you planning to play this game alone and you really want to who i am to say no to you but its not recommended, if you have NOT played this game before, i do not even recommend that you even download this game (unless you coming for the design things) if you does not planning putting any money into this game (witch you should not even think of because its completely waste of money) i do not recommed because you cannot really do much without a premuim and other suff that you have to buy with real cash, and lets not talk about the MM in this game (belive me its the most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest MM out there)   so pretty much if you not planning about wasting all your money into this game and you like crap MM, toxic community, hardcore P2W game style and you didnot played it in the past, DO NOT EVEN THING of even trying it out its completely waste of time (and i know i keep saying this but this game is crap).  overall game expirence 3/10 - could be 10/10 with a better company behind this game
2435	0	a	This game is literally the most horrible game ever made by man/woman/aliens/zombies/whatever. It doesn't have a good community the new players gets insulted straight up,  They do not get help from any veteran players, and most of the players who see's the new players will tell them to 'Uninstall' the game and so on.. incouraging players to leave the game even more..  I'd advice GamersFirst or whoever the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ runs this company's game. To take action to those who violates the term of 'Respecting New Comers to the game'  Its a thing, Please try to put it to good use. I don't see this game going anymore further in the future.. The community in this game is horrible and it literally needs a reality check. So help me, take this game down if this game gets out of hand with 'Insult every new player that steps in the game'  My rating? Not a recommended game. To those who wish to learn how to get started with the help of veteran players.  It's also P2W, So forget about it.
2436	0	a	I wish I could recommend this game, I used to play it for a few years long ago (it was fun, especially with friends, the customization is amazing and it's an original concept) but it became more and more crap as time went by...  Why ? 3 things : - The 'pay 2 win' system, no words can describe how cancerous it is... You have to pay a lot for optimized guns, upgrades, cars (and cosmetics as well), that litteraly kick the asses of anyone not having the same upgrades...  - The hackers and cheaters. Always those,ruining everything, there's plenty of them here.  - The community itself. You barely have any chance to find a server where people are nice or helpful with the low grades and newcomers. Or even playing as a team. There's mostly insults, solo-players, and anti-fun people, added to the 2 first points I made above.  It has potential, really, but those things I listed just destroy it all. That's REALLY sad... I miss the days where it wasn't that deep down the trashcan. You can try it out and see by yourself, but quite frankly it takes time to get used to the game and I don't think it's worth sticking with anymore.  Good point to highlight nonetheless : it's free to uninstall.
2437	0	a	Once upon a time there were 2 boys named timmy and johnny. Timmy had found a awsome game he thought so he introduced that game to Johnny. Johnny was a bit skeptical at first but then he started to enjoy this game aswell. He had enjoyed the game so much he even put some money into the game. He thought wow this games character customization is so great but then he soon came to realize his stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing friend had made him oblivious to the fact that the game was such utter pay to win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t that he decided to uninstall and go back to CS:GO where the hackers were a dime a dozen but there was no pay to win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t like APB had. People i am little Johnny, Dont make the same mistake i did. Dont waste your time or money thinking hey its gonna get better or hey this will be fun because not only is it pay to win there are lots of cheaters. Enjoy :)
2438	0	a	heres a story:  APB Reloaded dated fallout. They kissed and fallout gave APB game crash sickness and there is no cure. APB cant stop crashing thanks to fallout.  10/10  would break keyboard over chrash again
2439	0	a	Game has become pure pay 2 win, years after release there are still a number of issues with the game with lag within the game, hit detection being completely off, glitches in mission scripts causing one sided games.
2440	0	a	cant even start the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.
2441	0	a	nah not my kind of game
2442	0	a	WORST PAY TO WIN CRAP I HAVE EVER PLAYED
2443	0	a	This game is gay. An need to fix their hackers problem. IF I HAD BROUGHT THIS GAME I WOULD SEND A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED IT. SAYING: F!!!!!!! U!!!!!!!! . BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF IT. JUST GET RID OF HACKERS! 0/10 for now. Ps people reading this I dont care about grammer.
2444	0	a	Full of with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.  So one of my friend told me this game is not pay2win at all,but its not true. So lets talk about 1 gun for now,wich is one of my favorite. The shotgun. So if you compare the JG tactical shotgun with the Colby CSG,they're 2 different weapons.  The colby CSG is almost like a damn sniper shotgun,but the JG tactical cannot do anything like that.  Thanks g1,you just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up an another game.
2445	0	a	today this game is pay2win.. y dont need skill anymore in this game y have use moneyz
2446	0	a	it is ablsolt crap i got done for nothing it is serisoly anoying pepole spawn kill so its a WASTE OF TIME TO PLAY so i dont recomend this 0/10
2447	0	a	My game keeps crashing and nothing can fix it this game sucks  
2448	0	a	not works and when its work it crash
2449	0	a	In the beginning i had no idea what to do, so i just walked arround random and killed NPC's. eventually i knew how to ram a shop with my car, and i earned money. with this money i couldn't do much. so at the end, i had 1 hour of fun and now every time i play the game (which is not often), i just get an overload of boringness.  EDIT: i have removed the game of my PC, and it seems to be les than an hour
2450	0	a	this game has a lot of potential, sadly the developers are too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to get their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together and instead of fixing broken things just release more cashshop crap to get money.  cashgrab/10 would not recommend even to my mortal enemy.
2451	0	a	too many hackers and cheats the game is rather pointless and greatly unplayable because of this and the free to play is hugely limited and again pointless. I would rather put my money into a single player game before putting a dime into a cheater run disappointment like this. only thing thats worse than the world full of cheaters in this is the pathetic company that makes it impossibl to do anything about them, but then again why would they the cheaters are the ones giving them cash so like NFSW they will pander to the cheats as usual.

2453	0	a	When you first play this game your immediate idea is 'Aww yeah. I'm going to be a bad*** robber.' Sadly the curtain falls away to reveal the issues with the game. The fact you constantly have to buy guns or shell out a fair bit of cash to have a perm gun. The vechiles vary greatly which is awesome but again you often times have to shell out real money for the good things. The game play is sad. Basicly meaning anyone who pays the money for the best gear is probably going to win.   All in all it was fun for a short bit but after a while the zeal subsides.
2454	0	a	foucking game 
2455	0	a	I cannot even make it play
2456	0	a	Piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Needs to be burned
2457	0	a	Great game idea, bad base players all out for themselves, devs are just wanting money shame could of been a great game and a bigger success if it was put on the right course.

2460	0	a	I've +500 hours (without steam) and i can easily say that devs don't care anymore. They don't try to keep cheats away. They just ban the ones using 'DETECTED' cheats. That isn't instant so they just open new accounts and keep cheating. Also you can pay for cheat. It is called 'ARMAS MARKETPLACE'. You can buy some weapons that is equal to cheat. You won't get banned for that though. By the way, when there is a patch i would get excited. I thought they will bring something new and good for the game. Every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time i check the updates, I see more overpowered weapons and more bugs. Game is done for me.
2461	0	a	  Worst Pay to win unfriendly Beginner unbalanced â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game you will ever play Rating 1/100  Can't even start or i get a guy with 30 ranks higher in the enemy team with a sniper  
2462	0	a	FPS drop im have very Cool PC
2463	0	a	I have put many hours into this game, and it is extremely fun. However just like Blacklight: Retribution, very pay to win and lots of hackers. I still love this game, however you will probably not.
2464	0	a	It's a pay to win game, or with extreme skill or hacks you will be able to live through a whole mission without dying.  3,5 out of 10 would bang if i was forced to.
2465	0	a	the server is very lag!
2466	0	a	Dont Waste your time GTAV is better

2475	0	a	It has great character customization and some great features but the gameplay itself is extremely repetitive and overun by hackers and P2W Players. This game is the definition of Pay to Win. It sickens me.

2482	0	a	This game is so terribel. i have played for alot of years, on my other account wich is some times ago, and i tried it again on this account. And it was impossibel to play.  The game is so unbalanced its insane, if you are new you will get rekt to pieces and you will never have a good experience with this game. This game is so badly optimized that you will have to have the best pc in the world playing this game good. I have an okay good pc but i still get FPS shatters.   Costumazation is kinda good, the prahics isnt that good so it will not really look good. Alot of pieces of clothing you have to pay for, unless you just want a kinda boring persona.   Cars in this game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed, alot of times they will glitch out. and havning lag and driving is like dont drink and drive, and there is alot of p2w cars you can buy.  Weapons are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, use 20 bucks and you can get a account permanent gun, that you can use from level one. Even tho alot of the P2W ewapons are just looks of other guns, its still a waste of time using money on them. And not minding the joker boxes wich are boxes you can 'unbox' and get weapons/cars   At last. I WILL NOT RECOMEND THIS GAME!!!. Play this if you want to use 1000 hours learning to not mind, bugs and other stupid flawes that are in this game...... Sad to see such a good potential game, getting wasted multiple times over and over again. I would go som far to say if EA realeased this game, it would be better........

2488	0	a	For the love of god, don't do missions. In my experience there's a lot of P2W out there. Although the customization and the worlds are great, the PvP makes ArcheBlade look easy.

2498	0	a	I have put many hours into this game, and it is extremely fun. However just like Blacklight: Retribution, very pay to win and lots of hackers. I still love this game, however you will probably not.
2499	0	a	It's a pay to win game, or with extreme skill or hacks you will be able to live through a whole mission without dying.  3,5 out of 10 would bang if i was forced to.
2500	0	a	bugs, hacks, p2w weapons, imbalances   if these sounds great for you, well go ahead play the game and make yourself angry.
2501	0	a	Dont Waste your time GTAV is better

2528	0	a	i realy dont know its fun but not fun why not just get gta 5?
2529	0	a	,
2530	0	a	New to the game, Games Community calls you a â™¥â™¥â™¥ and tells you that you suck Trying to do Tutorial, everyone teams up on you to kill you  Nobody will welcome you Everybody will hate you   Pay to win, everybody will like you  worse than Call of Duty, Clash of Clans, Flappy Bird, and Grand Theft Auto combined
2531	0	a	TL,DR: Good concept, poor execution  APB Reloaded, what can I say.  At first, it sounded great, an open world comps vs robbers stile game, something different. Lots of customisable options including kill sounds, brilliant.  Then the play started.  It is not friendly towards new players. The tutorial system works for the first three full 'missions' then its kill the most advanced players in the game. The customisation is clunky, time consuming and the customised music requires advanced midi making knowledge.  Players on both teams seem to either hack, or have no lives (or money) as weapons are mostly pay to aquire (and then only for a limited time), or they have aimbots and kill in up to three shots (normally takes around ten).  As an added extra, after the recent update, the game likes to randomally lag and kick people out of the game, disconnecting for unknown reasons.

2546	0	a	For those looking for a pay2win version of saints row 2, then APB is your goto. Otherwise just play GTAonline. Or keep moving along.
2547	0	a	I've +500 hours (without steam) and i can easily say that devs don't care anymore. They don't try to keep cheats away. They just ban the ones using 'DETECTED' cheats. That isn't instant so they just open new accounts and keep cheating. Also you can pay for cheat. It is called 'ARMAS MARKETPLACE'. You can buy some weapons that is equal to cheat. You won't get banned for that though. By the way, when there is a patch i would get excited. I thought they will bring something new and good for the game. Every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time i check the updates, I see more overpowered weapons and more bugs. Game is done for me.

First of all this game is so laggy, i check my ping on other games, its only 130 I am in saudi arabia, i joined Joker NA east Second this game is so buggy, and can cause your computer to crash any time, my computer crashed like 17 times A DAY because of this game. Third why cant we steal other criminal's cars? I mean Hello? We are criminals? we can steal anything we want. This game makes no sense at all.

2574	0	a	This game is really the reason why GTA exists. There\'s so many things wrong that I can I\'ll just list them:  Cons: 1. Game is very laggy. Comment: Even with a good computer, this game runs terrible. 2. Laggy servers. Comment: I have FANTASTIC internet and I always seem to lag as if I was using cafe wifi or something. 3. Not too many players. Comment: Wouldn\'t blame people who don\'t play this. The game is quite bad. 4. Boring side content. Comments: The character design and gun design while neat doesn\'t really seem to please me. 5. A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF DLC! Comment: What person wants to spend over $200 on some very lame DLC. The DLC doesn\'t even help.  Pros: NONE!  Final Thoughts: If you want a good open-world,multiplayer game. Get GTA 5! You could buy every GTA game with the money you spend on the DLC. RATING: 1/10 WITH A HORSHIT STAIN STAMP! &gt;:(
2575	0	a	Wow never in my day have I played a game so horridly maintaned.  Litreally you cannot go more than 20 seconds without lag and this isnt an individual problem, no this effects everyone playing  -lag? check -pay to win? check -driving thats worse than Ride To Hell? check -hackers? CHECK â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CHECK  I really like this game but oh my sweet jesus ive never played a game so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing laggy and easy to hack in my life even god damn CoD5 servers are in better condition than this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Its a damn shame that this awsome game is ruined by such â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing useless employies who are down right â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid to use anti hack systems that are 10 YEARS OLD! and never maintain there â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing servers.  Untill they fix this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I give it a 3/10 because of how frequent lag and hackers are and IF they fix it I will give it an 7.5/10 thats how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad the lag and hackers are, and thats saying something.
2576	0	a	BWAHAHAHAHA  HAHAHHAAAHHHEUHEUEHUEHEUHEUE LULZOR  If I wanted to play a shooter with lag I'd be playing another game on a Jupiter server.

2582	0	a	Had high hopes for the game, and had anticipated it for some time, sadly the game wasnt what id hoped for, im sure some will like it, those who were leveled up certainly seemed to like it, but on my end it was kinda confusing whis is as deeply negative as i intend to go in my review
2583	0	a	 This game is a poor mans Saints Row; full of hackers and idiots online. Also a Pay-To-Win, so anyone who hacks/pays real money for guns has a total advantage over average players. Driving any vehicle is delayed by a fraction of a second so getting used to turning/steering is plain retar**d. The customization of vehicles is honestly one of the best I've ever seen in any game so that's ONLY what it's good for. If you're cheap then play it, otherwise don't be a cheap as*hole and buy Saints Row.  2/10
2584	0	a	The Second Life of shooters.
2585	0	a	F2P, Free to dont pay but suck it should be called. This game is 100% Pay to Win. Good guns? Buy them for 10$ :( . Well this game could have had great potential, but the greed for money destroyed that. Thumb down

2587	0	a	It's a Pay2Win   it was better back in 2010 where you had to level up and buy your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with in game money not real   So Do i recomment this game?   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-N-O

2609	0	a	the huge hype game that hyped itself to make a comeback with engine updates that never happened in years, people will buy pay2win weapons and spend a ton of money on cars even though they know that the game sucks and wont get an engine update.  sucks
2610	0	a	Ok, I am going to be 100% fair on this review. If you don't want to read a lot in short don't buy it scam is being nice when talking about this game.  First, the Good. The game was a fantastic idea and subject. The customization level is super.  Where it starts going down hill is there is no way to deal with issues like people interfering or cheating in other people's missions. An example you are driving away in a vehicle to protect someone and the opposing team ask friends not in the mission to ram your car and pin you in a location. you have no ability to retaliate it would be better or more fair if you could at least shoot back and kill the drivers of such cars as a deterrent. The most you get is a report system which no one ever gets kicked from that I can tell after all there is no real way for them to tell what went on and they really want to keep money coming in.  Then it gets worse than the rampant cheating and hacking crap.  Anything good in the game is going to cost you real world cash through G1C which is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing rip off to hell at 400 for 5.00 considering what you get in return compared to even other games. At least most real world currency systems are a penny or less per credit.  The other option is joker credits which you can earn at a healthy 10,000 in about 2 months.  Then there is no real balance to the game you will be continually put up against people who either have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ loads of real world cash to throw away on good weapons and crap or you will be put against people with enough level to make it pointless.  A company that actually gave to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the users and the experience wouldn't be selling better weapons for real cash. You would find stuff that doesn't actually effect performance for sale. You can see this in countless game be it CS:GO or planet side anything you can pay for you can earn in game.

2630	0	a	Pay to win, hackers.
2631	0	a	This game is so innapropriet and it's encoureged for younger kids to play it insted of GTA. This game should be removed from steam and never have anything like this again.
2632	0	a	IN my opinion this is just another one of those games that look like gta V's ugly cousin :v
2633	0	a	pay to win  lots of tryhards unbalanced gameplay

2637	0	a	very bad game!! much P2W!!
2638	0	a	Well APB reloaded is a fun game in customizing but the gameplay is utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this is because the game is way too crowded with hackers and pay to win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s who spend $250 on virtual items wich you only keep for 3 days.  So no, I do NOT recommend this game to anyone! Avoid at all costs!
2639	0	a	I played this game a while back, I wasn't very impressed. You have to pay to get almost anything, whether it be a gun, clothes, or cars. The game was filled with hackers. The only pros were the amazing customization, and the large open world.
2640	0	a	Worst GTAV-PayToWin-Copy ever made.  1. Joined. 2. Made a character that took about 15 minutes to make and spawned. 3. Missions... wait, where do i get them... 4. Ah ok, completes tutorial and some other â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 5. Loses and wins sometimes, gets lvl3. 6. Can't find a shop. 7. Plays with a random team. 8. Fails. 9. Gets a new car that is totally civilian while i am a cop. Also gets a modification that automatically gets set on the old car. 10. Can't de-equip the modification to set it on the new car. 11. Can only find the 'pay with real money' shop but can't find the shop where i pay with in-game money. 12. Can't find the customization place. (the place where you're supposed to make an own logo/spray/clothes/cars) 13. Gets lags while i got about two times better specs than recommended. 14. Quits and tells myself 'what told me to try this?'. Oh right, it was supposed to be a fun openworld-copsandrobbers-shooting-thirdperson-robbing-patrolling-racing game.  + Great costumization. + Open-world. + Many weapons. + A good-looking loading screen.  - Can't access customization. - Can't really call this open-world because the world is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T. - To get a new weapon, you need to pay with real money. - If you want to buy a new weapon with in-game cash, it will be with a limited time. - Forever-loading loading-screen. - Completely NOT beginner-friendly. - A few minutes-startup. - Download to play, pay to win, don't pay to lose, lose to uninstall. - Only lvl50 players with shotgun that have 500 metres range. (this is total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, a shotgun that shoots at this range!?) - You will regret downloading this. - It's total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, you won't like it. - After reading some posts, i understand that this game was 1000-billions-millions-thousands-houndreds-100 better before full release. - If you want to play something like GTA for free... just download GTAV cracked instead of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i promise it will be better to download 30-50GB and wait in forever than download this... how did i call it? Oh right, total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t.  [0.0000000P00P/10 Would try to forget about it instead of uninstalling it again.]
2641	0	a	Do not be fooled by this game and it's positive comments. It sucks.   First, you create your character with a very glitchy and unreliable character creator tool. You are then thrown into a random place with a tutorial, a gun, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ clothes. After that it's pretty much play missions, try to get cash, die from people with OP weapons, and repeat.  Not that great, extremely frustrating, MASSIVE P2W, but playable. 5/10. Uninstalled D:
2642	0	a	This game haves great potential if it would be in the right hands but this isn't the case and I doubt it will ever be. It was somewhat good back in 2010 and 2011 I at least enjoyed it and so did lots of my friends after that starting back in 2012 it went all downhill. The managment is idiotic, the new devs are once again untalented uncreative idiots, servers suck s-y â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the list goes on. Instead of fixing the f-g game they ignored the issues and implement more issues by every f-g patch. Armas shop guns are pay to win bs and get tweaked by a new weapon release so obvious bs. Lots of players obviously left due to all these issues. I really wish someone good enough will take over this project because as it is now it's a pile of rotten s-t and there's nothing left. I really loved this game but they just destroyed it and took a s-t on it as a cherry on top. GF and RP I hope you f-king die in a longest pain.

2655	0	a	Could be a lovely mixture of Saint Row The third with GTA (hope someone makes a better version)  Great cosept and a bit similar in how distany works, but in all Very awfull UI, not so fun driving, bad popups, more and more  postive things: - Alot of cars and guns - Alot of custom things you can add to cars and cloths  Bad things: - Most is 'locked' away behind pay bars something like nearly everything... basic guns and vehicles no... they mostly is pay for 1 free of everything else (primary, car etc) - nothing going for it in the beginning only when you have been able to unlock some its fun? - No balanced districts becomes a problem - UI sometimes can't explain whats importent and standard menu and all is messy and is not good at all (don't even tell new players where the car custominazion is or 'store' etc)

2663	0	a	From what I have played it seems this game can be played as a pay to win mainly because everything in the game is mostly bought with real money if you want anything good just buy it all the really high damage guns and armour and everything can be bought without any real work.
2664	0	a	I played this game back when it came out and it was sold off to another publisher or something like that. I only remember that this game was TERRIBAD and can't believe it resurfaced again like a Zombie with positive reviews. I can't believe it has the BALLS to charge 140$ for this stinking pile. You can get much better games for 10% of the price of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. *coughBorderlands2cough*
2665	0	a	I just want to let you know you are a bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idiots working down there. I just uninstalled your game because you have Steam Log in / Whatever the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your company is called log in. Okay i want steam log in but not i still have to make a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ account with your company? whats the point of this. Uninstalled just based of this stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hope youre proud of your engineering and your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game looks like wow and gta 3 had a baby and it touched your hands and you had your head up your â™¥â™¥â™¥ and were trying to dig it out what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this.
2666	0	a	best character/car customization simulator ever. you can even make your own themes/songs/symbols too! thats great! i changed my appearances many, many, many times to suit my mood/tastes.  what's bad about it? everything else.  summary: - i played for a good 2 years since its closed beta - many game mechanics changes (some good, some bad) - very good time-waster - the grind is crazy. good news is, you will hardly feel it - learning curve for newbies? HELL. you will think everyone is hacking. yes there were many hackers in its early stages. now? probably just a few. but you will still think holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ everyone is hacking but they're not. they just have superb situational awareness (like you would play a MOBA). fast reaction time, memorized map and routes, and understanding of the game's wonky mechanics. seriously, for real. i know i would accuse people were hacking if i didnt already have thousands of hours clocked on this game. - car handling is wacky. takes some getting used to. - game physics are many lol moments. - fun to play with friends (all experienced clan mates? good. time to faceroll. all newbie friends/pubs? in for major butthurt) - game not p2w. all you can unlock can match payer weapons. (i was high ranked pure F2P) - most important reason not to play this game: the publisher, g1, is a lying, corrupt crook who cheats their playerbase. you won some g1 credits? DENIED. they no give you cuz you exploit their event due to THEIR wonky game mechanics. won anything else? DENIED. last minute event rule changes. wtf? many empty promises. i swear, no lies. - dwindling population + broken matchmaking = enjoy getting banged from behind by the vets. if that's your thing, play this game. otherwise, avoid.  -there is no PvE.  signed, honest confessions of a vet

2668	0	a	Pay to win
2669	0	a	Should've left it in the dumpster where I found it.
2670	0	a	This is just another 'Pay-to-win' game that is advertised as 'Free-to-play.' Sure, all you have to do is download and play, but you have to stick with crappy items unless you pay. It isn't the worst game, but it certainly is not great.
2671	0	a	Full of microtransactions, gameplay isnt anything you will totally like, the only thing i really like on this game is that you can be in the same car with your mate, and drive over buggy no life city, fighting against op god like people that has bought good weapons for real money. 4/10
2672	0	a	One of the most unbalanced games I have ever seen. It is free to play but not free to enjoy. It's pay to enjoy. The 'joker' rifle that you can pay like $3 a month to rent is one of the most OP guns I have ever seen in a game. It kills you in only a few bullets and a lot of people use it, making any and all f2p guns that you can unlock completely useless. Why don't I quit crying and get it then? Because it still means that I will not be challenged by anyone on the other team unless they also have this weapon. It is just not any fun killing/getting killed by two bullets. Trust me it is just not cool. The other massive flaw is the location of missions. They are put in a way that whichever team gets there first can win by simply camping the area because there are just not any ways in that will not see you getting mowed down no matter what. It is some of the worst mission level design I have ever seen.
2673	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
2674	0	a	The gameplay is pretty fun, and the store robbing mechanic is good too.  Sadly, to get better weapons, get cool cars, get different clothes, or anything really, requires you to pay money on the game. I am constantly in fear to get shot down by a guy who did actually pay money, because they have way better gear than me. Playing actual missions in online is also near to impossible, since most of the time one or two people who paid for the game have OP guns in which they carry their team or your team.  If you are looking for a REAL F2P game without others having an advantage for paying, then keep looking..
2675	0	a	I have a good pc but cant run?

2681	0	a	FAQ:Why do I hate this game?  A)After playing about a 100 hours in the game i noticed a few things that i hate :  -Pay2Win concept : Are you a rich dude with $400 bucks to spare?Do you like good weapons?Do you like super cars?  If you are willing to spare about $400 or MORE then this game is for you!  -Hackers : Are you good at hacking games?Do you like to cheat and get the upper hand easily?  Then this game is for you!  -Do you like lagg?Do you like crashes?  Then this game is for you!
2682	0	a	I bought this game on it's original release when Realtime Worlds developed it. It had a good concept but they didn't handle it well, hackers took over and eventually the lack of profit helped Realtime Worlds collapse. It lasted about 2 months until it was shut down.  Moving along it was taken over by Gamersfirst and, believe it or not, they managed to make things even worse.  It's still a hackers paradise ... but now with a ridiculous cash shop.   It's a shame, the concept is still great and the customisation is still fantastic but it's still being handled badly.
2683	0	a	worst game ever i played so far,just got in,got banned,by being new,10/10 would pick up a pistol and shoot Reloaded,took more than 40 mins to download,what was very boring,then i could play 20 minutes (its a disgrace to steam,its the WORST game i've ever played,yes,even out of the bought and free games)
2684	0	a	The game used to be good but now its another pay to win game.
2685	0	a	literally worst game i played in my life, i believe that if you play this game you should reconsider your life. driving with cars was pretty fun tho  2/10
2686	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!  I played this game at oringinal launch as well as after it was 'reloaded'. It was great! 3rd person shooter with EPIC customization. Very much enjoyed playing.  Now heres the only reason you need to never play this game:  My account was banned due to 'cheating witnessed by someone'. No cheating involved ever yet I was banned. Read around its not just me. Many others have had accounts banned for no reason at all. Spent all the time leveling up, getting cool things, customized everything only have have my account perma banned for having one good night where I was dominating the fight clubs.  Save yourself the hassel and just never play this game unless someone who cares takes over. If you are good then you will be banned. (I dont play this on steam but writing a review everywhere I can to help prevent this happening to others)
2687	0	a	Bugs and crashes is what makes it the worst.

2690	0	a	I once loved this game, now i feel ashamed. This game had promise but ended up in development hell. They spent 100$+ million on this game and this is the results of a game with idiotic planning and promise. If they focused more on clan/faction battles AND pvp this may just been a little better.   Rest in peace 2011-2014 \'Pay2win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you\'

2697	0	a	anytime golds and fakes silvers in bronze district.
2698	0	a	Unless the game gets a major FPS fix its not worth the space
2699	0	a	I had quite a bit of fun when i played this game. Even setting aside the rampant, unchecked cheating. Or the people gaming the ranking system to bring their rank down from gold or silver to play on bronse.   What finally put me completely off was when i tried to use a controller. It completely broke the game for me. Even after i tried to go back to KB+M, there was some kind of glitch that made it so i was constantly turning to the left, and throwing grenades also fired my weapon.   When I tried to get support, both G1 and Steam said, 'not our problem, talk to them', and pointed at each other.
2700	0	a	how do u even pronounce apb?
2701	0	a	Boreing game better off playing with barney and friends poor pc peasants still have no games 2 play , no wonder its a free lol.
2702	0	a	So this game has more bugs than Skate 3 most of them are graphic glitches. The whole game is booring with its repetitive missins. But i like charater customizacion
2703	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so boring and full of pay to win people
2704	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2705	0	a	plays like a cheap GTA ripoff mixed with the BRINK chatacter modelling.  dont get irritated by the good looking videos,the graphics are old, the controls of the cars are terrible, it feels like the car is always drifting, the animations are bad, the sounds are also bad.  the music is good, also you can do a lot of cusomization.. all together a free hipster kid game thats trying too hard.
2706	0	a	Micro transactions, toxic community, hackers, bad matchmaking, horrible gameplay, and $30 for a permanent secondary? what's not to like?     God this game could be so much better if the devs weren't 100% focussed on microtransactions. And if it didn't have a toxic community, and didn't have a disgusting engine.
2707	0	a	This game looks like the best game ever created, but it's a swift, hard kick in the balls once you start playing. It's pay2win, the missions are impossible, the shooting sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥, and it seemed to me like I was the only cop and everyone else was playing as the criminals.
2708	0	a	This game is fun for the first few hours and has amazing options for character customization, but gameplay quickly becomes shallow and meaningless and has a very strong 'pay-to-win' feel. The anti-cheat security was terrible when I played the game and was a deciding factor in giving up on this title.
2709	0	a	Here's my recommendation: that you AVOID this game, and REFUSE to pay any money towards the publishers: G1. The customization is great (well, what was left to GamersFirst by the original creators: Realtime Worlds, RIP), and the driving is funny in a Gmod-physics kind of way, but the combat is utterly deploreable. Biased towards the criminal faction, and favorable to those suckered into paying a monthly fee of around $9, this game is what gives 'Free to Play' a bad name. And as if that premium membership bonus (between x3 and x4 cash rewards for missions/activities, and faster leveling for unlocks) wasn't bad enough, but their marketplace sells items that, once bought, are not customizable, and many are exclusive to the real-money market. Seriously, a gun that looks like an AR but has the EXACT same secifications and performance as the in-game rentable AK costs $40. It's a $40 reskin. Marx isn't turning in his grave, he's weeping and saying 'I told you so!'
2710	0	a	Other than the really good customization features. You are up for a sketchy game. By sketchy I mean, there is no anti-cheat system, nor is there a proper 'Report abuse' feature. They don't care who or what you think is hacking. They just do whatever to buff or debuff weapons and more. The guns and most of the other features are locked unless you have premium. It's one those F2P games where you have to buy Premium in order to get the most out of a game. Of course, most games do the same, but for this game, Premium statuses make the game unbalanced. (This is my opinion and expressing why I wouldn't recommened the game).
2711	0	a	i hate this
2712	0	a	it has to meny hacker
2713	0	a	i like it how is in the free to play section
2714	0	a	well I don't know because the game won't start, tired everything even contacted steam but it won't work. I can't help it, I don't really like the game cause I have spent so many frustrating hours on it. post if you are having the same problem.
2715	0	a	It's an addicting game, but lacks many things that would make it immensely enjoyable, headshots, visual range greater than 325 feet, heavy weapons doing more damage at closer ranges, destructible environments, melee abilities, FLAMETHROWERS, WHY DOESN'T IT HAVE FLAMETHROWERS??? Also, for such a large variety of weapons and gears, it seems to be very limited on options for vehicles, most upgraded vehicles are one of about a dozen set base cars with multiple modifications that do for the most part, NOTHING.
2716	0	a	this game sucks, windows defender blocking .exe, u cant skip intro screen -&gt; making my brain explode because the volume is over 9000, after downloading it says wrong installation pls deinstall -&gt; i not even played this game but hell it sucks
2717	0	a	This game isn't really new-user friendly. It handles much like GTA, but guns are unlocked based on your level, and you have to kill people do gain levels. They basically start you out with a stick and everyone else has rocket launchers. It's more fun to play with a friend, especially if you're just starting.

2718	0	a	if you wanna play a free 2 play game, then don't play this game it's a pure p2w game. guns from the store are way OP. if you wanna spend money or have enough keyboards to break, play this game :D
2719	0	a	Interesting idea with a nice enough looking world with action packed missions. Actual gameplay is just garbage. Horrible. Cheaters everywhere, unbearable. Not fun at all, die all of time be a hacker *yay!*
2720	0	a	Why does it say mostly positive if most of it is not recommended. This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2721	0	a	Extremely P2W. Over half the things you can buy with money which provides an unfair advantage to those people who have more money than others.
2722	0	a	Do not play this game. It is riddled with hacker and the devs have no vested interest in preventing it on any level. It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in pathetic and the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who developed this WILL NOT ban, prevent, or fix any issues.
2723	0	a	My steam profile keeps saying i'm in game APB reloaded but i'm not so lets get to the point THE GAME IS RUBBISH CRAP
2724	0	a	First time setup takes too long to load. if you are immortal or simply have a few years to waste then i do recommend this game. customization in this game is amazing, but gameplay is simply horrible.
2725	0	a	Are you serious. Game cant even run for 20 minutes before it crashes my computer and I'm forced to power cycle the damn thing. Graphics are at lowest of low settings too. As low as you can go even though I can run the game at higher settings....still crashes. I was pretty excited to play this game too. Well thats gone now. Back to Arma 3!
2726	0	a	One of the worst games you ll ever play. Its a pay2win game. Even though it tries not be it just cant. Its also one of the worst shooting games i ve ever played, because when you are in combat jumping around and running around will help you avoid bullets as well shooting while zig zaging around the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ place kill the oppoment. Snipers are not snipers, meaning that they dont even have a scope. its all 3rd person everybody! FU SNIPERS! Also the fact with cops vs criminals is one of the broken pieces of the game. 80 people max in a server. Every other server is empty. Did i forget to tell you that you rent guns? no? well you rend guns, cars , and lots of things that makes you baddass in this game for the max days of 10(atleast for guns i know of). I would rate the game 20/100 just because at first i had fun killing my other m8s because they killed me while investigating. I would recommend not getting involved with this game. Waste of time. IGN 10/10
2727	0	a	game will not even play, says apb failed to initialize physx??? game wont play at all. i have a gtx 980 i7 4790k and still wont play
2728	0	a	The game wont even start from the launcher 10/10 would never play because it wont even start.
2729	0	a	Great consept. Poor execution. Repetertive, clumsy, dosn't 'capture' the mmo-feeling, not the most interesting world. Milking the cow.
2730	0	a	If you don't spend money you wont have a chance
2731	0	a	lags like a dogs â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you dont have a pre good pc and is about as fun as watching dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dry to play 4/10
2732	0	a	All I see in Merry Elfin' Christmas. I feel like I should just go back to fantasy MMOs. Also, I cannot find my pants.  &gt;1/10
2733	0	a	For anyone who is sane enough you should not buy this game. I expected not good as it is free to play but seriously this game is soooo terrible!
2734	0	a	I took all the garbage trucks (3 other friends )and drive around the biggest streets just destroying every vehicule I would see. Destroying every minute a person would have...messing with his gaming time...you can't do that anymore as theres no more garbage trucks...
2735	0	a	so last year i wrote a review on this game where i rougly said: gameplay is junk, the people who play it are jerks... it's pay 2 win... it's sloppy, the controls responds slowly and the graphics load slower then a snail could win a god damn marathon.  BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION IS GOOD!  thats everything positive... the clothing and tattoos... if they had this kind of custom items in a game like grand theft auto it would be the BIGGEST GAME EVER... but it dosen't, it's the worst damn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i've tried...  do NOT try it! if you have ever tried playing a first person shooter and someone kills you repeadetly thats only the tip of the iceberg, here you will be kicked off servers by punkbuster because someone SAID you were hacking  i was stupid enough to recommend this only for customisation but i regret this now...  NO! do NOT play this...  I CAN'T WARN YOU ENOUGH! DON'T.... DO IT!!!!
2736	0	a	I'd skip this one. Its buggy and unbalanced. Great Idea, though, and the character customization is very, very good.
2737	0	a	full of hackers
2738	0	a	I thought this game would of been good untill i download and it dosent even open!!!! i would like it if this was not bugged
2739	0	a	buggy as hell and doesnt want to load the game and if you do get in the game you might get about two min with the game before it crashes. i dont recommend this game to anybody.
2740	0	a	no start why??
2741	0	a	I'M FROM PLANET VEGETA
2742	0	a	this game is very buggy it takes a long time to load i played for about a month and i couldnt handle playing anymore so im done with this but its realy fun.
2743	0	a	Honestly, I really like this game. Its free to play and fun to play but it always glitches and lags too much to even pretend to play. If it wasnt for that Id highly recomend it but there seems to be no fix for the lag and whatnot 
2744	0	a	It's a pretty good game, but it's the BIGGEST PAY TO WIN I HAVE EVER PLAYED. For example, it takes a while to unlock the rocket launcher. I've played this game for days and haven't come close to getting the gun that can one-shot cars. People can go straight in with real money, buy a rocket launcher, then run around blowing people up when they are such a low level. It doesn't seem fair that the people playing the game like it should be played are getting crapped on by the people who run in with a wod of cash and buy everything in the game.
2745	0	a	This game is NOT noob friendly. in APB reloaded, there is no sign of matchmaking whatsoever. it just compiles a random clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of people to duke it out. which means if you're just starting out, you could easily be placed against someone who's been playing nonstop for months repeatedly. I tried to get on my feet in that game for 3 days, but every cent I earned went toward ammo or was lost in deaths to people who play nonstop and pay actual money for the good equipment.   also, I dare say that this is the single most infuriating game I have ever played. even more so than Call of Duty. I don't get angry easily, but this game angered me to the point where I threw my mouse across the room and shattered the damn thing. So, here's a warning. if you're angered easily, AVOID APB RELOADED  It's a shame, because the idea behind it had a lot of potential. I was really excited to see someone finally making a game like this where you could actually be the cop with custom cars and weapons. It had so much potential, but the absolutely terrible matchmaking and blatantly obvious pay to win strategy ruined the entire thing for me.  long story short: unless you're willing to spend an untold amount of hours on this game, all it's going to do is infuriate you. it's a gigantic avoid from me.
2746	0	a	It's fun, but it never got the finish it needed to be a truly great game. At this point, I would say wait for GTA V for PC. It's got similar gameplay, but GTA V is just much better in every conceivable way.
2747	0	a	Best example of a pay-to-win I have ever witnessed.
2748	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS BUNNY HOP SIM. EVERY and i mean EVERY enforcer bunny hops camps and does everything scummy do no waste your time or space with this pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and â™¥â™¥â™¥
2749	0	a	can be very slow and takes a while to load up.When it loads it still very unresponsive and slow.
2750	0	a	I installed this game as soon it was released as free to play, but the game was pay to win from day one so I eventually stopped, and I'll explain why.  I understand that this game needs pay to win elements in order to recoup costs and generate revenue, but there is a universal line which the company has unfortunately crossed.  Pay to win items in this game include fast cars and premium firearms far deadlier than the stock firearms which otherwise would have taken days to weeks to earn, if at all. Not only that, all weapons are subscriptions that need to be renewed. That is the line that should never be crossed. Pay to win elements should never award any significant advantage over the default elements. If it does, the quality of gameplay is flushed down the toilet and it's not a real game anymore.  In summary, the only way to be good in this game is to buy the deadly premium weapons on which the company has unabashedly placed exorbitant pricing, and apparently most players do so every day. It is the only way to have any amount of fun in this game, unless you enjoy being unfairly DM'ed.  And this is from my experiences a few years ago, which I haven't written about at the time because the review system hadn't existed then, plus I haven't thought of writing one until now. The system hasn't changed, nor will it ever, because why would the company scrap the system that generates probably the majority of their dirty profit? Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this one game, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere to satisfy your daily cravings of online shooter fun.
2751	0	a	This game makes Hitler looks innocent .
2752	0	a	Fun game ruined by hackers
2753	0	a	Whoop de doo. I played this game before it came to steam, but I couldn't write a review because I hadn't played it on steam. Great.  So I installed it, started it up, shut it down and uninstalled it.  That's right, I never went to actually play it here in steam. Why? Because, if it's only half as bad as I remember, then you want to stay far away from this game.  Bad matchmaking, elitst jerks, hackers, money hungry developers, and much more. The company making it calls themselves ''gamersfirst''  ... Don't get me started. but hey, if you're filthy rich and don't know what to spend all your money on. This game is it.  I won't bother telling anything else, everyone who's given this game a thumbs down is summing it up pretty nicely.  It's too bad, really. I loved the concept, and I always enjoy character customizations with few limits. 
2754	0	a	So I once had a good review of this game, but I have to change it I'm afraid.  I have well over 400 hours into the game (Played before it was on stea to track my hours) so I'm not someone coming in talking out of their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ angry about pay to win.  I have spent money on this game  I have earned a lot of the same stuff outside of spending money  I have leveled both a Crim and and Enf 1 max one close to it.    This game is a shell of its former self, and really there is no game like it still, but you should still look elsewhere. I won't scream hackers, because they've gotten good at banning them, but there are still a few cases where it is far past questionable, especially from the same few people that somehow stick around (I've played long enough to know good from hackker).  I won't say the game is entirely pay to win, and this is coming from someone who HAS paid into the game, but I will say it has gotten damn close, especially the past year. New guns come out that you can only buy, their are not great earning eqvuilanets, and the few that are in some cases can take you as many hours as I have into the game, not including mods, and making the money to rent them constantly.  It isn't a terrible game, but sadly it is run buy a company that seems more focused on their shop than their game. Still the same tired maps this many years later, still the same tired missions that get old and are easily exploitable if you know them well enough (some sides WILL easily win if they are defending/attackin for example). The company running this game seems to have given up on impleneting anything new into the game outside of guns they sell you with real money, and seem to have all but given up on the idea of expanding the game or adding content, which is sad. Game STILL has potentially, simply because no one else does this really, outside of GTA 5 online, but the devs need to realize they are running a game server, not a cash shop.
2755	0	a	free 2 play my â™¥â™¥â™¥
2756	0	a	f@@K this matchmaking... Golds playing in bronze and silver districts but not in gold... Gj , well played useless â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ks...
2757	0	a	So awful. Its a pay to win and does'nt even try to hide it. Without buying a pemium account you are restricted to almost no weapons, vehicles or clothes.
2758	0	a	Pay to impress kind of game. I would not buy if you not willing to pay alot of money. Good gameplay just very limited if you havent paid for extra content that should be free.
2759	0	a	Worst game ever. Bad severs, bad steering (for cars), almost everything is bad. I don't understand why people plays it when you can't even do stuff properly.
2760	0	a	Download the game, and still haven't been able to get IN the game. If a download is this stupid.. Screw it!  I do not recommend this game
2761	0	a	Just not my cup of tea.  I can see why players might like a game like this, however I despise multiplayer shooters of this nature. I was made curious by the apparent explorey open-world look of it but it's just a fancy-pants way of dressing up a series of competitive multiplayer maps.
2762	0	a	A classic example of a P2W (Pay to Win) game. Great concepts, but is just ruined by that one system.   PROS: - Great concept - Quite good graphics - Seems promising at first - Great costumization idea  CONS: - Pretty bad matchmaking - Pay 2 Play system - Unbalanced weapon prices (in the Armas Marketplace) - Server lag - etc.  Overall: 4/10
2763	0	a	it sucks
2764	0	a	Couldn't even get it to load up :/ kept crashing and I have a amazing computer...... so I hope this works for someone and they can tell me if it's good
2765	0	a	That lady's pants are about to fall off.
2766	0	a	Dont get me wrong this is a fun game. BUT WAY too many hackers on here i still play it but it gets frustraiting when you get killed over and over.
2767	0	a	 http://i.imgur.com/97iwBwp.jpg 
2768	0	a	Pay2Win always throws away any value or fun, don't get this game unless you can bother to spend lots of cash.
2769	0	a	Nah Even if you have 8gb ram it still says not enough ram
2770	0	a	Heyyo, DON'T GET THIS GAME. They ruined it. Bunny-hopping-galore even with sniper rifles it works perfectly. NTEC is useless compared to Joker and it's brutal how much Gamersfirst ruined this game compared to how they first started off in APB R beta when they balanced LTL weapons... now every gun is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. RIP APB.. maybe you should've just stayed dead. :(
2771	0	a	The game is VERY cool and funny, BUT it have 2 things that totally SUCKS:  -The matchking, u may play against players with LOTS of reputation ( levels ) more than you, i was 59 and i was matched against people with R 149, 229, etc, SUCKS!  -The weapons store, i have just 4 days playing and i have to play against people with more experience AND premium weapons, that means perfect damage, aiming, lots of bullets, etc, and they earn double exp and money than normal people, i understand its common you can buy premium isues BUT the difference between premium and normal is too high, the premium moddified weapons are so stupidly overpowered .   So, if you have money to buy premium stuff, welcome! enjoy it! but if you dont, dont even try this game, because ur only going to lose.
2772	0	a	SOOOOO much wasted potential. This game could have been what GTA online should have been, but too many flaws are holding it back.  The gameplay is very, very fun. Missions have you either breaking into buildings, hijacking cars, or hacking satellites if you are a criminal, or preventing criminals from doing so and arresting people if you are a dirty copper. While most of the time the missions are actually balanced and require strategic plays and superior aiming from both teams, there are plenty of times where mission objectives can be exploited by parking a car on top of the objective and shooting it til it explodes, rendering the mission impossible to complete. Not fair or fun. It is also very likely as a bronze rank you will get stuck against gold ranks with pay2win 1shotkill guns.  Also hackers. So. Many. Hackers. If you somehow manage to make it to gold rank, you will never be in another mission without an aimbotter. You won't. Ever.  Customization is amazing. Everything is customizeable from your character to the car they drive to the song the enemy hears when they kill you. But hackers. Always hackers everywhere aimbots hacks hacking hackers hacked bot botter aimot botting aimbotting hacks
2773	0	a	Even though I like the setting and the customization options, the connection for me was completly unstable. I kept getting timed out every 10 minutes. Unless it runs better for you, I wouldn't recommend getting it.
2774	0	a	Actually i thought that this game was nice  but in this game the ping is high and playing this game is waste of time Score:3.6/10
2775	0	a	this is a good game  but have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad engine
2776	0	a	The game seemed promising enough at first but when I got in a car I noticed the most peculiar of happenings. The driving lagged...a lot. like when I tried to turn left, it wouldn't turn for like a second or so after I pressed the button, leading to some frustrating driving. This one seemingly insignificant drawback successfully ruined the game for me.   Final Verdict: 2/10
2777	0	a	Never spend money on a free game. If you download this, you'll either have to buy your gear or spend hundreds of hours trying to keep up with the frequent spenders.  This game is realy just fun for the moment, not a long term game.
2778	0	a	It's hard to call that playing as it kept shutting down. Buggy.
2779	0	a	Its bad 0/10
2780	0	a	Feels like a bad russian Ripoff of Saints Row 3
2781	0	a	despite what the above may say i do not recommend this. EDIT: you can put not recommended now, so that's nice
2782	0	a	This is worse then a pay to win. You have to pay to even have fun! Worse then freemium.
2783	0	a	Pay to win? Pay to customize yoursef? Pay to customize your car? Pay for more decals on your car? Pay for more weapons? Pay for more damage?   Hell, Its basically a pay to play game.
2784	0	a	I have quite a lot of hours on this game i've played the game since 2010 when it belonged to the right people people that did want to make the game amazing and it was they did succeed but the down side is they went bank robed and sold the game to gamersfirst, Why is that bad you ask? Well simply. Gamersfirst are money sucking none carrying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s bassicly, like EA just a much worse version of EA. Also the game is broken now so don't bother spending time on it.
2785	0	a	The game altogether is good but they need to put in stamina and jumps should use it, because all the enforcers do is jump and sprint side to side so you cant hit them. And another reason you cant hit them is horribly broken hit box. Then when they are in range they just tase you then handcuff you. Then when they taser is recharcing or somthing they jump around and shoot like a mad man while you are trying to keep it realistic and you pump 20 shells in to there No good-low lying-bottom feeding-dirt eating-crap sandwichs, they pump 2 shells into you with an OP gun and kill you. And everyone either does this or snipes. Thats what you get with this Crap-sandwich with no bread game!
2786	0	a	This game was one of my favourite games...but it went really bad, but why ? The Armas Weapons (pay with real money) are really expensiv so you can pay up to 40â‚¬ for a account bounded sniper rifle. The most armas weapons are too strong like the 'scout' ,a new sniper rifle, you can shoot perfectly with it in the air you can use it outta a car and you can run with it...lets look on the free 2 play sniper rifle you cant do jumpshot you cant fire outta a car you cant run with it and the fire slower then the premium ones...but the biggest problem of the game is: that the gold players ( the strongest players haha ) play on the silver destricts or on bronze so you have no chance against some overpowered players who kick you out of the match in your own destrict...everything what i can say is: stay away from this game if you cant play in a team and if you wont pay money to win.
2787	0	a	I have decided to not to recommend this game to any of my freinds. The reason lies within the game itself. The terrible community(people constantly calling you names if you win or lose). Terrible matchmaking. At the start of the game you will face people like you, noobish etc, but a few more matchmaking games and boom! You are faced with enemies with Pay2win guns, better skill and level, hackers, or just dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trolls. You will feel overwhelmed with either anger wanting to throw your computer out the door, laptop on the floor. Wanting to kill the enemy team. Or sadness that you downloaded this game. This game does show some promise but it is lost. The lag was so bad I had to turn of my computer or stop playing. If you want to save yourself the money and space on your computer you will not download this game. AND I WILL TELL YOU NOW DO NOT, AND I MEAN DO NOT BUY ANY GUNS.
2788	0	a	Pay2Win always throws away any value or fun, don't get this game unless you can bother to spend lots of cash.

2795	0	a	I played APB a LOT back in the day, before it ever arrived on Steam. Now I decided to get back into it to see how things are, and sadly... not good.  APB is a good game. It can be fun with other people. It can also be a rage fest at times,   Regardless, I can't recommend a game that I here crown as the King of Grind. APB has a lot of customisation, its a damn shame that a lot of that is locked behind a massive grindfest. You could pump hours into this game, and still have most of the top tier weapons locked away, or your car customisation slots mysteriously locked with no explanation given on how to unlock them.  APB is a good but heavily flawed game that is good for co-operative play in short bursts, but I can't recommend a game that forces you to grind away it.  It is also a game that is slowly dying. Most of the servers are unpopulated, with only the top grindfest players remaining. Social district tends to have the most population of anything and it is sad to see that the developers have not really done anything to APB other than your low-key fixes and balance updates. Really, there isn't anything new, and it looks like APB will slowly approach its final resting place soon..
2796	0	a	This game is probably good, but I would never know.  When I installed it the first time and tried to play, I got a PhysX error saying that PhysX was uninitialised by the game. I re-installed my drivers from Nvidia control panel and then tried to get the game going again. Same error popped up. I did this 5 more times. I restarted, I turned off my monitors, I did the hokey pokey, everything. This game is unplayable. I tried to open a support ticket for this, but when I tried to open a ticket there, the page was blank except for the text 'Support is unavailable at this time.'. It's like they don't even want me to play the game. Free to play doesn't mean you can publish â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like this. Even if it's free, I was still ripped off.
2797	0	a	The idea of cops versus robbers is an exicting new idea with it having so much potential. APB Reloaded delivers a new and chaotic idea of the dangerous streets of the city of San Paro.  - If your most intrigued by story-line based First Person Shooters, APB Reloaded is not for you. The story is a linear of 'Criminals are causing harm to the city, choose to protect the city or be against it.'  + The customiztion is where this game shines. Most likely, your character won't look like the next persons, with complex and advanced yet simplistic character customization your able to really stand out of the crowd. To the colors of your bandana to the acne and scars on your face, this is the only one reason I always seem to crawl back to this game. Spending hours apon hours can give such a rewarding feel when you remarkably created your very own first ever unique character. Your character is not just the only thing you could customize, the rims on your car, the hood of your car, you could even add a little jingle that your foes will be forced to listen to time and time again when you defeat them.  - A major problem I've encountered during the many hours I've pumped into this game is that the overall gameplay is awful. Huge pay to win aspects floating around every direction you go, match making couldn't ever seem to match me with a suitable ranking, and overall was just a frustrating experience. When I would buy an upgraded Sniper Rifle to counter the other Snipers, I would be picked off in one shot by one across the map, which was purchased with real money. Or if I were to buy any rifle, would get RPG'd with the only warning being that distant beeping noise right before the missle is launched. It keeps you cussing and always feels like your at a disadvantage if you haven't put any money into the game. The city feels rather dull and has a bland approach, and the civilians feel artificially made with no effort put into them besides the modelling and possibly voice acting.  - You can't have a non-gaming computer and be able to play this game. It's rediciously CPU intensive and requires powerful graphics cards to run at High settings with 60+ fps. (From what I remember)  All and all the game brings many laughs while playing with friends for a short while, but I would never consider playing this alone for long periods of time.
2798	0	a	this game dose not even work
2799	0	a	For me the game wasn't smooth enough it needs to be worked on a little more
2800	0	a	This game is sh*t. I'll play it.
2801	0	a	For now im going for not recommended because the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game forces you to create a profile on another site WHERE !!! You cant even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing register !!!!!! So i havent even got to the stupid game :((((
2802	0	a	LOL! Surprised this game is around still.. Its like the only people who play it are either fanboys or tryhards.
2803	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor with outstanding lag, and a wide open map for you to get gunned downed in by ppl who put considerable amount of money into. If you want a pay to win game this is it, if not then dont bother.
2804	0	a	I dislike the whole stupid crap game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2805	0	a	Hate Weapons that Expires!!
2806	0	a	Pay to win Game!!!!
2807	0	a	please don t download it lol
2808	0	a	Don't play this game unless you want to create a bond with it to only play this game and no others. This game is EXTREMELY unabalanced. No matter what weapon you pick the 'pay to win' weapons will ALWAYS outclass you. SMG's are unbalanced as they can shoot from long ranges and still maintain accuracy, and those are SECONDARY weapons. Essentially just pay for a SMG and a Rocket Launcher and then nothing can stop you. The only fun part of this is the music making. I wouldn't call this game pay to win because that would give it some decency. This game will make you it's b**** until you give it money.
2809	0	a	This game is a poor excuse to get money out of unexpecting customers. The game is very unbalanced, so if you wanna play a good free to play game this is not for you. Only people that pay to play/win will have fun becuase they get too beat down on the people who actually have lives. The core game play and customisation is real fun until you get into a game with people that will kill you instantly. My friend and I have played this game for many hours, yet have never found a match when you can win without paying. this game will constanly make you it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ till you give it money.
2810	0	a	Wold be a fun game if it wasent full of aim bots and wall hackers. but it is so no real point in even playing unless you like that kind of bs i know some people will say just get the aim bot for your self so you can fite back but whats the point in even playing a game where the only way to be competitive is to cheat with them then its no longer whoever is better at the game but whoever has the better hacks that some one else made because lets be honest all the kids cheating are to stupid to know how to make an aim bot.
2811	0	a	This is the worst first person shooter i've ever played. The maps suck, it's way too big and open for only 1 person(me). The servers are never up, and the gameplay is choppy and there isn't even any guns in the game. The weapon choice is absolutely terrible and graphics are bad. Infinity ward and Apple really messed up on this game.
2812	0	a	After playing 100 hours on it... I guess the game is okay, but the game really needs to be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing optimized, the more I play this game the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ier my computer gets, it's like just playing this game pulls down my computer... I'll list some Pro's and Con's  Pros: -Unique character and car customizations -Nice custom creations(Music, cars, special logos etc...) -The gameplay is pretty basic and fun  Cons: -You'll get facerolled in 9/10 matches -Extremely harsh on newbies -Poor development... the glitches and bugs... I can't even... -Pay2win guns, if you want a better chance at winning matches... pay up. -PVP matchmaking is fked up, you'll be put against higher leveled players. -Horrible servers...  Honestly... if you can endure all those cons, then this game is really awesome, otherwise... yeah, that's it e.e if you can endure it, please tell me your secret... I know I listed more Cons then Pros but I can't really think of anything other good of the game other then the customizations.
2813	0	a	This game did certainly look good at first, and I love police sims, though there sadly are not a lot of them around. I enjoyed this for a little bit, but soon it began to get boring and repetitive, and this is primarily pay to play. Therefore, I would not recommend this game, because it isn't worth it to pay for some crap in quite a horrible game. Don't play this game. It will waste your time.
2814	0	a	This game is plauged with problems, from cashshop guns/overpowered guns, to match making issues, a cancer player base, to cheating, and basically zero new content while the content they have is broken.  Don't even install it.
2815	0	a	Very unfriendly to newcomers, hard to understand what you have to do, confusing HUD, too many indicators... Resuming: too confusing. Didn't enjoy it, not likely to play it again.
2816	0	a	This is a 'freemium' game. It's free, but you have to pay for the good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to win
2817	0	a	Hate games that have optimisation, interesting quests, no camping spots, civilian AI and don't let you win if you give them money? Then APB is the game for you. Bet you want to play a bad guy too because being evil is soooo hardcore. Well you are in luck as the criminals always defend so you get to stay nice and snug while camping the point with your insta kill assault rifle that you splashed money on while those silly ol' goodies run at you with pea shooters. You sure are great at video games!  I should point out that the character customisation is brilliant as it lets you change just about every little feature but this is counterbalanced by every player you walk by having the green cap and jeans model as they never load in time.
2818	0	a	Like playing cops vs robbers?  Custom Cars? CTF? Hackers? APB! Reloadeded.
2819	0	a	wont let me play it because of an error
2820	0	a	It is a great game however, they need more free features in the game. Technically the game is pay to win, thats why I did not enjoy playing it :(
2821	0	a	i have 25 gb of space on my computer left after the download and it say i cant play because i need 2 gb or something like that
2822	0	a	Too many problems to have much fun with. Just avoid
2823	0	a	No real updates for years, mostly based on pay to win. Gets very repetitve, but a decent play at times. Community is mostly bad due to the fact that no one will show you any kind of mercy, but there area few friendly players who try help. I strongly recommend not spending any money on this game if playing at all.
2824	0	a	will not start
2825	0	a	Cant even figure out how to beat the tutorial  -10/10
2826	0	a	This game is GREAT but ALOT of HACKERS
2827	0	a	This game ruined my computer.  It made my computer say 'Busy Writing On Disk' and i blame it on this game.   Pros: Customizable characters,lots of guns.  Cons:Laggy,hard,Pay 2 Win,Ruined Steam
2828	0	a	cant open the game??? 
2829	0	a	Play only if you enjoy playing against cheaters and L.O.V.E unbalanced matches. Huge P2W fest.
2830	0	a	If you like repetitive gameplay or GTA-style PvP this is the game for you otherwise, run for your life!  It's fun Co-Op game to play with friends other than that it's pretty bad. 
2831	0	a	Terrible game, terrible devs and lately have been banning pepople for no reason while being full of hackers avoid like the plague
2832	0	a	This game is unfinished and buggy. Only creating my character took me about hour and I had to do it 3 times. And then, after I joined server, game started to crash every time I tried to choose spawnpoint. I have to wait to next update and hope they will do something. They did. I finally succeed to start game without crashes, but there were so huge lags that I refused to continue playing. Oh my God! This can be so much good game! Character customizations, symbol and vehicle editors. I don't know much games able to rival! Just, please, DO SOMETHING WITH ALL THOSE BUGS!
2833	0	a	~This review was original a recommended review for this game on 22 May, 2012~ The worlds best Free game.  ~New Review 2014, June~ I spend so many hours on this game that's unbeliveable. We have gone through bad times, good times, we've cried together, laughed together, and just been together since RTW release. I've meet new friends, found enemies, rivals which I've had so much fun with, when we found each other against each other again after days. And I've now came to the point, that this game is a zero. After Gamersfirst took over this masterpiece, is jumped down a hole where it hasn't hit the ground yet, and it's just a matter of time till the ground is visible. After every release, the game gets more and more bugs, and the server performance is getting worse. It's so hard for me to down vote this game, but.. I would lie if I did anything else.  Pros; - Had a lot of potential. - Had one of the best playerbases I've seen.  Cons; - Performance. - Servers. - Support. - The AI's - G1 is not willing to listen to the community, and is basicly ignoring them. - Only content updates, and rebates for their items which cost real money. - Outdated Anti-cheat program. - Outdated game-engine, 'Dosen't matter that much to me, but a upgrade would help them optimizing the performance'.  *At this point I just hope that G1 are willing to sell it, to a company who will safe it, while it's still falling down the hole, even though I think it's to late*
2834	0	a	The servers are dead... If you are lucky, there will possibly be one other person who will join the map you are in. That being said, after 10 minutes of play, I uninstalled.
2835	0	a	It's hard to not ragequit.
2836	0	a	Used to be a great game years ago, but now it's complete ****.
2837	0	a	Just terrible. I played it for 20 mins and deleted it when I realised it's just a tacky rip off of GTA.
2838	0	a	I have spent a hell of a lot of time in this game and sadly don't enjoy it anymore due to the low level of customer support and the continued deterioration of gameplay.  Constant lagging, rubber-banding and blatant rage hackers have further ruined what was already a fairly toxic community. The complete lack of GMs certainly donâ€™t help matters. Truly a shame considering the high level of customization and potential the game had. 
2839	0	a	its a really fun game, the world is expansive and you can customize the music, cars, clothes and many other things which is a pretty big plus.. but no matter how hard you work, its very oriented toward people who buy stuff in game, no matter how hard you worked for that machine gun by doing missions, you only get it for maybe a few days or a week, but if you buy it, its yours for good.  but ig your ok with that then this is your game, but I myself hate when someone a lower level blows me to bits with a machine gun and leaves me in the dust using a muscle car that goes double my speed, making it a quickly ending speed chase.  and even though it says I only played for an hour or so, I've had days of playing this game before I had it on steam, sad the say that it hasnt changed.
2840	0	a	After some time playing APB, and spending some money on 30-day premium account, I would not recommend the game. The game is full of hackers, the matchmaking is awful. Gold-rated players vs Bronze-rated players. The server lags every 5 minutes. The 'comunity' is full of annoying and toxic people. For new players, the game is non-friendly.  If you plan to buy guns, vehicles or stuff like that, for 30-day or lifetime, prices are way too high. I find the developers so greedy.   However, the game has a lot of customization chances, and the open world, free roaming and missions are good. But they don't justify the game itself.
2841	0	a	Kind of a grind.
2842	0	a	no its awful
2843	0	a	Too much to set up before playing, too much time for account creation and a million hours for the loading screens. Oh.. and let's not forget lag
2844	0	a	Until they fix the matchmaking in this game and allow new players a chance to progress without having to fight rank 200 gold threat players, this game is a disaster. I applaud the attempts at trying to prevent cheating, but the game is highly out of balance. You will start out with basic equipment and little understanding of the game and immediately face off against the most highly equipped players that know the layouts and have amazing accuracy.   While this game has mass potential and could be a very solid shooter, the people running the game have virtually removed the player base and removed any and all chances of attracting new players to the game threfore giving this game no real evolution. It simply dies off from the start for new players, and older players like myself alike. If one day the matchmaking systems and servers are more balanced, this could be an awsome game but for now, it gets 2 stars out of 5.
2845	0	a	Awful... Just awful
2846	0	a	Balance issues. Griefers. And just a bunch of trolls. Its fun to do the customizations and the costumes, but ever since APB was released, it never felt right to me...
2847	0	a	why no worky
2848	0	a	Pay to win. Nuff said
2849	0	a	wont work just keeps on updating and it takes hell to try to start it
2850	0	a	cheaters/10
2851	0	a	wow took hour 2 download and said i have not anoth room when my laptop is empty just steam and apb
2852	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PunkBuster !!!! Kicked me for no packed flow :|
2853	0	a	great game, or atleast if would be if it wasnt pay to win and stuck on a rent system with your gear. i dont like having to re purchase guns because i cant play regularly to keep them from expiring
2854	0	a	When the game finished downloading I couldnt wait to play it. But i was so dissapoited by the graphics and gameplay and servers ! Its fun for 1 hour or stuff ... and u cant compare this with gta !!!
2855	0	a	this is to laggy.....
2856	0	a	Awful game. A lot of glitches to exploit and matchmaking is just awful. Let's not forget the game breaks almost every time you start up so you have to repair it constantly. When I first started playing the game I thought it was pretty good, but the glitch exploits like standing on a moving car and shooting rockets so you don't have a chance protecting the vip started getting old. Also people not in the misson ram and flip you so the people on the other team can kill you.
2857	0	a	when I played APB before it became 'Reloaded': the shooting controls felt sloppy yet unforgiving; gunfights took place in poorly-designed spaces that were extremely difficult to traverse; the world felt empty most times and nonsensical at others. caveat emptor.
2858	0	a	APB was totally perfect when the original developers and publishers released it. However they wen't bankrupt because not enough people payed the Â£40 subscription requred to play in 2010. After that gamersfirst bought it off the original company and it's known as APB Reloaded now with it still having all the features which it originally had and even a little more new features I do not recommend it because it is heavily P2W. You still can play it however you won't get the good guns, perks, vehicles and unlimited customisation if you don't pay. It's a great game but it's not worth playing unless you're ready to pay for things. Review is based on personal expericence and opinion. I've played since launch, rebirth on gamersfirst and steam.
2859	0	a	Pretty difficult to get a formidiable gun without paying money.
2860	0	a	waste of time simulator 10/10 would uninstall again
2861	0	a	Havent even play the game yet and theres already an error -_-
2862	0	a	warning game is not good at all
2863	0	a	its not as fun as they make it out to be
2864	0	a	I Play this for may Hours. Many Many hours through there opener not steam and well it got worse as i played i loved this game Sunk hours of my life in to it but in the end Quit from disappointment the game population has dissappered as well.  I could go well in to depth about why im dissapointed but it would be very very long
2865	0	a	Nope. This game has absolute potential, but new players are vulnerable to hackers and higher ranks with overpowered weapons. Don't waste your time installing this game, unless you want to get blown up by a pornstar with an RPG and rage over it. The only good thing about APB: Reloaded is the character customization. Not friendly to newcomers, you have to pay2win. Uninstalled immediately.
2866	0	a	this game is straight up meth. hooks you in to the game. yet the game itself isn't good in anyway.   if your enemy has a better gun, your dead. how to win fights with equals, jump,crouch, act like a madman with a gun.  oh you want to know about the cars? well you can literally blow up a car by running into it with yours if it's fast enough. unavoidable death to teh opposing side. you can't shoot trough windows. takes forever to blow up teh car (unless you got a real money bought weapon) , which the driver gets a notification 10 full seconds before. unless ofcourse you got a rocket launcher. which insta kills anything, you can't really miss. and if you don't have a payed for gun. don't even think about shooting at a guy with a launcher. he will turn around and set you flying off better than north koreas rocket program.  oh you want guns? well you either buy it again every 10 days or you pay real money for it. even up to 40$. not even kidding.  only the basic concept of the game is good. but the game is literally designed to minimize skill out of the game. thus having better guns be an absolute grindfiest to get. or you pay for it. in real money.  only 2 good things, the character creation is actually quite good, but since it allows you to change your height, there is absolutetly no headshot dmg multiplier of sorts. hit him anywhere adn the same dmg is applie.  and for the otehr ofcourse the uninstall process. this game is horrible.
2867	0	a	It is almost impossible to kill someone with the first level guns, It takes 30 hits from the 1st rifle in the game to kill someone. Then you get blown away with shotguns and more powerful weapons. This is a pay to win game. I played for a day, and it was mostly dying.....
2868	0	a	This game is being slamed (mainly because of it being a bad remake), but could still be fixed if was done well. First off, this game has the option to make your own charater, clothes, music, cars, and clans... But it mainly makes you work for these items by making you grind missions or paying money. This game also lets you use weapons and steal cars, but it's as fun as it's intended... See where I'm getting at.  Also the game gets buggy with good or bad connection (even with the graphics on low), it's like you need a supercomputer to use it (just like summer wars).  I will give it a 6/10, but though I don't reccomend it, I am sure someone is going to play it because I said so... Go enjoy the rocks you use as soap, because thats how dumb you are to play this... I am still gonna play it though (to make it better of course).
2869	0	a	played this game before it was on steam and left cameback after awhile and left for good this time. This game is   HEAVILY   p2w it seems like, you have your 3 districts 2 fighting disctricts and 1 social district and you have fight club maps, the 'rank' system is based off of losing and winning which is dumb because if you go against p2w players you will lose you won't even have a chance the servers are kindaorienated towards your 'rank' you have green servers bronze servers and so on the hackers ruined this game p2w really ruined it not to mention all the lag respawn sometimes seems like it takes forever and fight club matches are extremely hard because of the lag and p2w players all the guns you get with in-game currency go away after a few days so yeah don't waste your time with it. -100/10
2870	0	a	10/10 Lawson is a lier
2871	0	a	It looks like a real good game but the vehicle handling is very poor.   Also, it is hard to learn to play as a newbie. You won't know who's who and will keep running out of bullets. Other players who are a higher level will come in and blast you out of existance, because they have more powerful weapons. Most of the weapons seem to be overpowered, (only been on the wrong end of them of course).  The GPS is next to useless, so unless you know the map, you have a hard time finding your way around.  Other players won't let you play your own game, or won't leave you alone, killing you on sight for no other reason than you are on the side of the law / or the side of the criminals, (as soon as you've ready'd up).   My advice is to make friends with other more experienced players ASAP then you might stand a chance.   I did team up, but the players I teamed up with were also at the mercy of more experienced players. It makes this game a real pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ and a waste of time to play.   Very little rewarding gameplay at the start, makes this an awful game to play as a newbie. You will get bored with being killed time and time again!  I spent two hours dying all the time and got so fed-up with the silly car handling that I am giving up on this game for now. 2014-08-17.   Sign-in - Sign up problems. (With GamersFirst). I also played this before when it first came out, I was annoyed that I had to go through the sign up process all over again, and even though I know my email and password, it refused them and I had to start again. When it came to my username, it won't let me have it, claiming it is already in use! (Well, yes it is - BY ME), but it won't let me sign in with the my original username anymore.  Overall:- a waste of time. I do not recommend it!
2872	0	a	This game isn't that good.You just go around making money for some stupid clothes.if you dont want to download it - don't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It will take over your life and make you think only for it so i don't reccomend it.
2873	0	a	Freaking stupid makes my profile say im in the game but im not thisgame sucks
2874	0	a	10/10 ign said it was great and look at them  another great review that made absolutely no sense
2875	0	a	this game is not working for me at all
2876	0	a	Has potential, but when you can't even leave the tutorial because the enemy team all have pay-to-win rocket launchers the game is unplayable. Stay away unless you feel like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out untold amounts of money just to exit the tutorial.
2877	0	a	Laggy gameplay, car physics broken, seemingly bad input lag, under average shooting mechanics. There are better free games out there than this.
2878	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2879	0	a	This game is more then just pay to win, it's pay to play. Your cash rewards, experience, and so forth are all dramatically reduced if you don't buy their VIP. It's not just that though, they refuse to make any new guns that you can actually unlock in the game. Every new gun is one you have to pay for! Not a single new gun has been released to public aviablilty since the restart of the actual game from APB, All Points Bulletin. If that doesn't make it bad enough, to truely enjoy yourself in the game you need to be a VIP. Why? Better and longer trials for weapons and cars, not to mention the ability to customize yourself and vehicle, emblems, and more to higher extents. The only game worse then this with a worse pay to win system is WarZ now known as 'Infestation Stores.' It is though fun to play once you're a high enough level, hackers are dealt with much easier now because of the anti-hack system known as Fair Fight was installed. There's without a doubt of equalization in weapons, but that equalization is in the ones you pay for. The graphics aren't bad, controls, mechanics, and interest isn't bad at all actually. From climbing ladders to driving off ramps from unfinished highways, civilians actively moving about the map to simply running over criminals or enforcers to catching criminals in acts of crime. There's a lot of innovation, tons of little areas to be found even when you think you know all the maps and secret locations. I can honestly say if it wasn't for the pay to win system this would be without a doubt the greatest game ever made. It's like Grand Theft Auto 4 and Need For Speed: Most Wanted (the original for Xbox 360.) You can steal a civilan car for the lulz of it, or make your own from a fairly wide range of choices and if you decide to dump cash into this game that customization can truely be starstriking. I've never seen a game with more customization options in my life. If this game allowed you to unlock everything over time it'd be an absolute reccommendation, but it not only doesn't try to do this but HEAVILY avoids it. Potential never met.  Did I mention they made it so you have to buy upgrades for your friend and ignore list, or that new content is never given to those who don't pay...?
2880	0	a	The idea was good, but the world feels to small, the way people misuse the system, even without hacking/cheating, just makes the game bad.
2881	0	a	The graphics were absolutely terrible
2882	0	a	Bad Community, Bad Servers, Good Game. Don't play without doing so with someone expirienced.
2883	0	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks u cant download it it is a gllitch 
2884	0	a	APB:reloaded.... i simply dont like this game, everything, EXACTLY everithing MUST BE PAY2WIN, also the missions are bad. this is my personal opinion btw... if you like open world but hate p2w (pay2win) then simply dont download this game.
2885	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. I really did. The customization is amazing, more games need to have this type of personalization. And that's the only good thing about it. The game itself barely works, controls are awful, the community is horrible (you get called a n00b by others when you ask politely for help and their best advice is to 'git gud â™¥â™¥â™¥ lel'), glitches everywhere. I'm going to quote another reviewer because everyone else has pretty much summed it up: 'Complete garbage and full of hackers of all kinds.'
2886	0	a	saints row, free to play version with all the features that you will never use. you need friends to play this and it's still boring most of the time
2887	0	a	Everytime I ever tried to play, it kicked me. Super.
2888	0	a	Game is okay, nothing spectacular though
2889	0	a	If you see an hour played, thats the time ive tried starting the game and cant even play it -.-
2890	0	a	Doesn't want to load
2891	0	a	this game sucks
2892	0	a	Cannot even play the game. My brother uses a PC with MUCH lower specs than mine and he can play with no issues minus slight lag but anytime I try and join the game it freezes right away. I can't even review any of the actual content because IT DOESN'T LET ME PLAY! Two thumbs down (-10)/10
2893	0	a	i play this game often but its fun, but there is one major thing i dont like in a PVP F2play. ITS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PAY TO WIN. There is no form of pve(maybe a bit for crims so mug and steal) like there is nothing to fight when you aren't in machmaking. (oh and before i forget SPEND 1,000+ DOLLORS TO INJOY THIS GAME IN PVP). The matching in this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gold like to farm kills in new and bronze lvl sever(G1 fix that) most thing in arms is over priced and OP(i TRIED some) there is also lots of grinding for f2p players. And let me not forget. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IN ONE VIDEO GAME AT A TIME ITS SAD ALL THEY DO IS TALK â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND GO AFTER NOOBS. AND THEN INSULT YOU ITS SAD. Oh and dont get me started on bountys. &gt;_&gt; thats all i gotta say(wen you have a bounty no one can help you now kiddys .-.)  Now some good things(the few reasons i keep playing this game BUT havent spent a peny on it). The costumisation(it also has cons on to it). It is nice the fact you get to costimize your character BUT for F2P platers its limmited.   THE CARS(I LOVE MY CAR &lt;3) cars they have nice cars in game when you unlock them. (as a crim) MUGGING AND STEALING-FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN, BUT hold up there are some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥(if the car isnt owned by you) who will take from that car you stole and stored stuff in. They can also blow it up even if its yours or not. NOW FOR A LIST OF MORE CONS IN GAMEPLAY #1-Hit box-delay #2-aiming-SHOOT INTO THE WALL WILL YAH #3Cover-DONT HIDE FROM A SNIPER BEHIND A CAR they can still get ya #4-Pay 2 Win- OP guns in arms anot enough good ones in game #5-SSSPAWNING(more in fight club) GET READ TO BE STAWN KILLED #5-The matchmaking- unfair matchup (one team new players other golds). #6(im not to sure on this one) HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAXXXXXXX-from what ive heard that is. although ive seen some imposible stuff(no not like 360 noscope like in cod like shooting through walls always knowing where you are aimbot(i think)).  Over all I would recomend it but it has alot to fix, so its up to you if you wanna play it. And plz try to have fun dont take anything sereusly mainly because its a game.   (i just want car parts new clothes and drive around fancy looking is that to much to ask in a game).   (i am sorry for my spelling)   5/10
2894	0	a	pay2win game with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of hackers  although it's probably the best of it's genre with the features provided in the game, it's still shitinfested with tons of faggs and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dev team  tons of faggs, meaning that the game has probably one of the worst communities in mmo history
2895	0	a	the perfect game for someone who has days of free time just to get enough money to buy a small amount of things  4.5/10000000
2896	0	a	Every time I press the game steam says the games already running and i cant even get to the launcher
2897	0	a	Looks so fake i can`t play that...
2898	0	a	The Servers for this game are very bad. EXTREME LAG its one of those games where if your new your not gonna be able to do anything
2899	0	a	Driving is really bad. When joining servers it takes 20 mins then says disconnecting. 2/10 -iG
2900	0	a	Sorry but this is a joke, after many hours of downloading, it installed and started updating which was fine by me, seemed normal, until the update got to 100% and nothing happened, it started saying 'installing Direct X' which i obviously already have. After maybe 20 minutes of confusion i looked around the steam forums, followed some advice, but this time when i clicked play, it bought up the same download window and just started downloading something different. After this it successfully ended, however the game STILL won't play. It either does nothing or says the application is already running (which it isn't.)  Pretty disgraceful, i downloaded Left 4 Dead 2 without a problem and it works fine. APB seems to be severely fukced. I know it's free to play but you still expect it to actually work after the installation progress.   EDIT: Just found out that on this game you have to pay REAL LIFE money for IN GAME guns, games like this should be ended. Money grabbing bull****.  ANOTHER EDIT: So yeah since this i've downoaded many games via Steam, none had any sort of problem what so ever, games i've downloaded and am able to run normally include Rust, Outlast, The Forest, Next Car Game, Battlefield 3, the list goes on, APB goes in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ list with gaming atrocities like Velvet Sundown who wouldn't even run.
2901	0	a	At 1st it was kinda like playing GTA online but after playing for while, it gets boring pretty quick.
2902	0	a	Terrible. First time I tried it crashed. Then I enter again, and it has PunkBuster kick error.  0/10
2903	0	a	For the most part the game is fun if playing with the right people. For there are only two types of people one will find in this game. Over powered and skilled players and a person who is going to play for a week and rage out. This game is usually fun for about a half hour before it dawns upon players that it is one of the buggiest almost dead free to play games in the market. In the end even though the game has one of the most interesting and advance character/vehicle customization beyond that it is lacking in every field and leave much if not all to be desired.
2904	0	a	It's a really poor game.
2905	0	a	Pay to Win. Veterans prey on new players. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.
2906	0	a	horrible, i hate it honestly.
2907	0	a	If you trade legendary items you get banned for scamming. So either buy it with ingame money or don't trade weapons at all.
2908	0	a	dont get this. here is what you should get instead from best to worst: 1) GTA V 2) GTA IV 3) Saints Row 3 4) Saints Row 4 5) GTA San Andreas 6) GTA 3 7) GTA Vice City 8) Saints Row Gat Out Of Hell 9) Just Cause 2 10) Just Cause 3 11) Goat Simulator 12) Borderlands 2 13) APB Reloaded this game is not wroth your time. it is a very nice games but so many other open world games are just so much better with so much more content.
2909	0	a	Im going to be honest: this didn't even make the mark for my expectations. What i was advertised was a Saints Row-type game with crazy gang wars and awesome gameplay. What i got was a clunky game that put more effort into its amazing character customization than the actual gameplay. It's just all over the place and not even Tobuscus could somehow make it better.
2910	0	a	p2w so hard, however I wouldn't even recommend this to you p2w kids cause the people not paying are hackers. the little bit that's untainted by the greed of the first 2 groups is broken or just not good. has the potential to be awesome but it's not gonna happen
2911	0	a	I've been on this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ train long enough to see that nothing changed since my last visit. The matchmaking still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks cosmic balls, it doesn't matter what rank you're at be it 10 20 120 if you just started you gonna have your self a real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Getting in to missions against players like ranks 255 with ARMAS guns while you out there are buttâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing naked â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of luck and jolly well â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. Unless you want to spend like 500$ at this game forget about having fun.  So yeah here's just a little rant about the stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balls to the wall matchmaking they have in this game. It doesn't matter what rank you are how good you are the game it pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing simple - bronze - silver - gold - that's it that's literally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing it, those 3 'Threat' levels - and it doesn't even care about anything else as long there are players on those channels. So prepare your self for 95% of the times for the best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ grinding frustration of your life as you will be totally obliterated by the oposite team. FUN! Right? It all can be fixed by adding a proper functional skill system, locking the channels by ranks, making channels that deny use of ARMAS stuff, but the current owners and devs just don't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I mean, while the money keeps rolling why fix it if it ain't broke, right?  To be honest this game has been for years around and really nothing has changed, no new districts, even fewer channels now, less people playing the game, the only new weapons and other stuff are behind a paywall. It had potential but they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed it up.  Giving this game a rating would be like selling your soul to the devil.
2912	0	a	I am sick i this shity game because ost of the robbers are hackers useing thier aim bot and it so easy for them to get money and who idea was it to have a rocket launcher thats thing is too over powered  Fix this game  JarJarGamer
2913	0	a	Before, this game was great. Good community, good updates. Now it's the complete opposite.  Unless you want to play the same thing over and over, same mission and what not, go ahead. But it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Usually the maximum of 7 people on fighting districts. The only thing that's good is the exit button.

2928	0	a	Terribly wasted potential. I was in the Beta for this game many years ago, and I even pre-ordered it when it came out. However, after Real Time World went under, and it was picked up again by Reloaded, everything went down the toilet. As said countless times before, the customization is amazing, and I really wish it could see it's full potential. However as we've seen, that's never going to happen.
2929	0	a	APB... APB its, its amazeing! The customization, The Detail. It had me playing it for hours. To the point where I wouldnt even know the sun has passed and the day was over. Though the community can be harsh. Thats not so bad. All the guns are ballenced, So i thought.  All the guns you get (In-Game with out paying) are ballenced, I am even talking about you annoying OSMAW, You are balenced as well. The thing is, Some guns in the 'ARMAS Market' Are just plain, stupid. I mean like the universal ATAC or the NANOS. Those wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt mixed in with the commonly known 'De-Threaters'. People who lose matches (So they may join bronze servers, Though they may be a gold threat rank) often ruin the fun time, Win or loss, i may be haveing with my friends. It is just a major killjoy when a bronze comes in with a ATAC and NANO, His skills are just way beyond me or my friends. As they reck havoc on all the missions, till they hit gold. Just to dethreat back to bronze, to repeat the process.  Another problem is the rerolls, People who make new accounts so they wont have to 'De-Threat'. Rerolls are quite common. As the fact i am a R212 and a R009 will join and kick me and my teams butt... Alone. With no help. Not saying they hack, I know some ppl have VERY Good skills on games. It just makes it hard for me to return to such a beuitifull game. This legit  'One of a kind'  game. It saddens me about all the problem this game has.   Lastly my ending result for this game. Sadly would be to  AVOID IT . It is very fun, Very Addicting, Very... Frusterating, Screen punching frusterating. Unless you are a natural born shooter. Evrey one I have talked to agree, that g1 (The Game owners) only have this game running because it is a 'Legit' Money farm for them, All they do is care for the money. I mean look up the prices for your self. All and All this game would be a five of ten for me.  Thank you for reading this review on this wonderfull game. 
2930	0	a	worst game i have played in along time, it may be free to play but the driving control is just well â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the game is PAY TO WIN 100% im not saying this because im a noob or whatever but the fact that you cant kill anyone your own level or below or hell even higher with standed weapons, you simply have to buy better weapons off there store to win
2931	0	a	This is excatly what pay to win looks like. When Realtime worlds had this game it looked stunning and everyone was excited but once it was picked up by its new developer, everything went down hill. The first thing you'll notice is almost everything has a lease on it and the only way to keep you Weapon, car, etc is to pay real money which is absolutly ridculous. I can understand the developer need to make money off this game but this is not the way to do it.
2932	0	a	Download to watch a duel with your anti virus software.
2933	0	a	Cool customization and stuff. But it's probably the biggest steaming pile of garbage i've ever played. With the time i've played i've been plagued with lag and shots not registering... It also runs like â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2934	0	a	start game rank you high look to buy a gun buy one gun perm $30 -10/10 dont feed their money hording.
2935	0	a	pay2win bullcrap just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing waste, in the relase of this game it was epic idk why it changed into â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

2937	0	a	Gamers Last. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this garbage.
2938	0	a	Buy GTAV Instead
2939	0	a	Fun to play but the launcher crashes so much you will rarely get to play
2940	0	a	This game was the best ive ever played until they started rolling out the Pay to Wins thats when everything went to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. i means really the matching making was horrible. people blatantly hacking, and the server lags. with the so much money they get on this game they choose not to fix it. i tried to tell them on facebook but they block me from commenting on anything they post. i guess they dont want to hear a fan of the game opinion about their game. i would have recommended this game in a heartbeat but now its just a Pay to Win Simulator
2941	0	a	This game is all good except for the fact that I got a bug from it where it tells my friends that I am playing APB all the time, regardless of what I'm playing now. It also wont let me delete it because of the fact that it still thinks that I am in-game.
2942	0	a	i made an account, went to validate my account , it said 'page not found ' i repeated it couple of times... didn't work, i went for help to the website but to get help i need to be logged in... 10/10 amazing gameplay (sarcasm)
2943	0	a	This game is just bad. First time I tried it, filled with adds promoting there FaceBook page so on. This game is full of rubbish like this. I wouldn't recommend, even if it is a F2P
2944	0	a	The free version is very hard to play. You are dead, dead, dead and dead. Running through the city with simple SMG, then someone with RPG blast you from behind. And again and again.
2945	0	a	At first, I was like: Hey, this is pretty fun!  And then I was like:  I can't even start this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unfuncional game without needing to restart my computer.  At least fix the damn game.
2946	0	a	Pay to play garbage. I hope you like renting weapons, because that's all you're going to get to do unless you drop real cash. The combat is third person awkward and boreing.
2947	0	a	Not really good, the game just throws you in with no explanation of what to do. Everyone is running around with p2w weapons which can one shot you, your start weapons are absolute useless shot my whole magazine in guy and he didnt even flinch.Also the grenade spam is preposterous everytime you come near a objective you are greeted by thousands of grenades... Loading times are waaay too long which is strange considering that the graphic arent that great. All in all I didnt had a good time also the community are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.
2948	0	a	So the game is getting some serious age right now. Decided to take the game for a spin today, to check if network issues has been fixed. Again!  Took my car for a drive, going to check if I could get to the closest gas station without crashing.  Another player appeared in front of me, driving. None of us didn't even bother to touch the steering wheel, but went flat out crossing our fingers in a head to head collision. This is how bad the lag is.  Unplayable.
2949	0	a	I thought this game would have good potential...but I was mistaken. The moderators seem to not care too much that 70% of the people playing are cheating using either a program, or macros.   If you ever even encounter people that aren't cheating, you can have a really cool fun shootout that seems realistic, but most of the time you will run into people that gun you down in 3 seconds using a macro or using a cheat program.   The community is horrible, and full of kids feeling entitled to everything that need to be spanked, and disciplined.   The devs really really really need to fix the cheat system (fairfight sucks and takes wayy to long to ban cheaters), and not even unban anyone that has cheated before.
2950	0	a	The matchmaking after awhile sucks. I hate it after only a day playing it and people actually use money to win &gt;.&lt;
2951	0	a	Pay to win. rofl
2952	0	a	APB has a really good concept for a free2play game, but in my opinion it's more pay2win than anything else. If it goes the route that Path of Exile does it microtransactions, I'll gladly return. I shouldn't have to be forced to buy a weapon or anything that gives me gameplay advantages. I want to like APB, but it's the pay2win elements that is turning me off completely from the game.
2953	0	a	I have been playing this game for quite a while now, honestly had a whole bunch of fun when I first started, however the game is too pay to win and has honestly been ruined by people who are actually using cheats on the game. Now when I say 'Cheaters' I'm not talking about people who are actually genuinely good at the game, I am talking about the T rank players that join missions and get about 100 kills and 0 deaths. This honestly makes the game quite boring for others and can get annoying when you're doing the Criminal vs Cops districts.  The game can be the biggest pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ when it comes to players too, unless you're willing to throw 10-20 bucks into the game to buy yourself your own vehicle, dont even think about trying to make money with other criminals or cops around as they WILL steal your vehicle and turn the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in for themselves. They can also take things from your car even if they're not in the same group as you. (Unless you own it)  I also honestly never really liked the Market system in this game, you could be really good at designing things but honestly, none of the prices were ever realistic.. people would just put stupid symbols and songs up for $999999999 or even $50000.  APB is a fun game and has some good potential, there is just a few things that need fixing before I'd give it a good rating.
2954	0	a	played this game before it was on steam and left cameback after awhile and left for good this time. This game is   HEAVILY   p2w it seems like, you have your 3 districts 2 fighting disctricts and 1 social district and you have fight club maps, the 'rank' system is based off of losing and winning which is dumb because if you go against p2w players you will lose you won't even have a chance the servers are kindaorienated towards your 'rank' you have green servers bronze servers and so on the hackers ruined this game p2w really ruined it not to mention all the lag respawn sometimes seems like it takes forever and fight club matches are extremely hard because of the lag and p2w players all the guns you get with in-game currency go away after a few days so yeah don't waste your time with it. -100/10
2955	0	a	Well, after playing this game for a short amount of time, and I know you will say you haven't played that long, but it is very poorly put together, and not enough time was put into missions. They get extremely boring and it is very difficult to gain money. The money isn't the issue though, it's the ranking system. It does take some time to get used to, and it is not confusing, although it is time consuming. The marketing is not well put together as well. Very inconvinient. The driving mechanics as well as the shooting mechanics aren't the greatest either. Driving is very delayed when you want to turn, and shooting is very inaccurate due to large crosshairs, even when you aim in. All and all, I'd give this game a 6/10, mainly because of the graphics being so good for a free to play game and the idea. GamersFirst definetly have something started. They just need to finish it..
2956	0	a	Haven't played APB for 2 years now. I didn't remember much, besides that my expreience with the game was positive. It was fun.  Now, two years later, I downloaded it and I was very disappointed. The game haven't changed much. Same old problems are still there. Some things became even worse. APB eats up all my RAM for breakfast and freezes after several minutes of gameplay.   It was such a promising project at first, now it's just another failed MMO. 
2957	0	a	If you like waiting extreme periods of time just to play a low graphics game, this is the game for you! When you first log in, you get to what I call the 'black box of death'. (And that after all the 10 other loading screens). Then you'll sit through 24 more loading screens and eventally wait 12 hours to get in a server, only to find that everyone is a total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that only kills you.
2958	0	a	It looks like a real good game but the vehicle handling is very poor.   Also, it is hard to learn to play as a newbie. You won't know who's who and will keep running out of bullets. Other players who are a higher level will come in and blast you out of existance, because they have more powerful weapons. Most of the weapons seem to be overpowered, (only been on the wrong end of them of course).  The GPS is next to useless, so unless you know the map, you have a hard time finding your way around.  Other players won't let you play your own game, or won't leave you alone, killing you on sight for no other reason than you are on the side of the law / or the side of the criminals, (as soon as you've ready'd up).   My advice is to make friends with other more experienced players ASAP then you might stand a chance.   I did team up, but the players I teamed up with were also at the mercy of more experienced players. It makes this game a real pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ and a waste of time to play.   Very little rewarding gameplay at the start, makes this an awful game to play as a newbie. You will get bored with being killed time and time again!  I spent two hours dying all the time and got so fed-up with the silly car handling that I am giving up on this game for now. 2014-08-17.   Sign-in - Sign up problems. (With GamersFirst). I also played this before when it first came out, I was annoyed that I had to go through the sign up process all over again, and even though I know my email and password, it refused them and I had to start again. When it came to my username, it won't let me have it, claiming it is already in use! (Well, yes it is - BY ME), but it won't let me sign in with the my original username anymore.  Overall:- a waste of time. I do not recommend it!
2959	0	a	if you like constant run ins with cheaters/aimbotters/wallhacking all that crap then this is the game for you, if not steer away from it they have punkbuster but it doesnt do anything cheaters run rampant and on the weekends they are ever present G1 doesnt do anything to stop them either or even try

2968	0	a	Awful game. A lot of glitches to exploit and matchmaking is just awful. Let's not forget the game breaks almost every time you start up so you have to repair it constantly. When I first started playing the game I thought it was pretty good, but the glitch exploits like standing on a moving car and shooting rockets so you don't have a chance protecting the vip started getting old. Also people not in the misson ram and flip you so the people on the other team can kill you.
2969	0	a	A game with great potential, ruined by what only can be described as incompetent developers. This game is mechanically unbalanced and unintentionally designed to bring out the worst in people, and despite the crappy engine the game is built upon that would prevent quick changes on larger scale issues, the game still commits simple game design sins, the biggest one being selling mechanics as premium items.  This is the ONE THING YOU DONT DO IN A F2P GAME, it's the quickest way to unbalance the game beyond the developers control, and the prices in the store are beyond extortionate and exploitative. Despite the various lead developers and community managers that move in and out of the company (which really makes you wonder what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is going on), apparently no-one collectively sees this as enough of an issue to fix.  It's sad then that it's still the MMO i've played for the most time, but to be honest im hoping now that another much more intelligent developer will make something that encapsulates the brilliance of this games concept and actually be able to make it good, as i've given up on hoping Reloaded Games recognises these elements as actual problems.
2970	0	a	Worst game I ever played(money sucker).
2971	0	a	game will not even play, says apb failed to initialize physx??? game wont play at all. i have a gtx 980 i7 4790k and still wont play
2972	0	a	ruined game/10     it's not   Ghosts   .... I mean this is worst than Ghosts     And that is sayin somthin
2973	0	a	well all i have to say about this game is that its completely bull crap because every time u try to log in with your email and password it always gives that error 11386 or something like that and u try looking it up on youtube or something to tell u how to fix it we follow the directions and it still doesnt work and its annoying u cant really enjoy this game when u cant even GET PASS THE FREAKING SIGN IN AND ITS FREAKING ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i highly not recommend this game
2974	0	a	This is practically a sucky knockoff of Grand Theft Auto for free-to-plays. The graphics are bad, there is little to keep the player interested for long, customization is limited (unlike Saints Row), there are few game modes, and it feels repetetive. The only redeeming quality is that it is free. 12/100.
2975	0	a	So hmm, this game is awsome, the features and combat system is amazing the only down about this game is that theres too many hackers. Idk if hacks are easy to get in apb but you can see one hacker in almost every missions u play
2976	0	a	APB~  + Decent graphics   Customization  Open world  Impound   ~ Guns and vehicles (the cheaper set) are rented for a few days    - Matchmaking is unbalanced most of the time  Missions are repeatitive and some are unfair  Buying powerful guns with real money  Hvt when doing great (I forgot what this is called. Wanted/Heat level?)  Too much shooting   *Note: I never used real money to purchase anything.*  This was a fun game when I fisrt started playing it. Being able to customize my character to whatever I wanted and having almost the same for the car was nice also. The graphics were OK, and the amount of guns, clothing, and veheicles to choose from was moderate.   Gameplay itself was decent. It was fun exploring the area and going after the criminals and getting paid for it. Most missions were fun to do and most of the time I did have a good team. After awhile however, the missions dd tend get repetative. Especially if the player is solo and searching for a mission/group. Many times I had gone with a team of 4 against a team of 2. Other times it was an equal match but the player levels were unbalanced. Whether or not I failed, the same mission would usually pop up after the next or right after that. Also, it's awesome when a player is doing great on a mission then all of a sudden becomes a High Value Target and everyone is alerted to that HVT. Now, that player that was doing great has around 20 players hunting their â™¥â™¥â™¥ for a bounty. Usually they were killed within 15 seconds.  I'm honestly a bit mixed on the gun/car lasting only a few days. Guns I can understand, even the paid ones to *try* and balance the game. But I hated paying a lot for a car that would be gone in a few days. It would take awhile to get enough money to ..I guess one could say to 'rent' a vehicle since payment was little and I started to be matched against higher levels. The money I was saving then had to be used for a better weapon if I wanted even a chance at killing some. Even the default gun players receive at the start is fairly balanced. I've killed many with it. But it doesn't compare to a sniper rifle that is a one hit kill.   Most players kept to their self. Others were chatting on the global chat which was mostly friendly. The rest were of course people trolling. I only had trouble with a few and the rare person that laged like hell. (or hacked)  What I played was fun...  ...Till I was killed 22 times trying to get to a mission objective and being blown up by someone on the opposing team with a RPG. No matter where my team and I went, there was always somebody waiting in a corner, or at the objective. I did get to run over the person once though! Why stay for 22 deaths? I don't like to rage quit.   Since then I would drive around waiting to see some action pass by. Then when a group went by I would follow them to the objective then take the cars they stole from the civies and impound them for cash. Which was pretty good if they stole a high performance veheicle. Especially armored trucks. Oh, and the vehicle wasn't damaged too bad.  - I can't say I fully enjoyed the game since I died *alot* from people who used real currency to purchase their guns. However, because of that, I can't fully recommend the game. I could over look the matchmaking (since CoD did that alot to me) and the missions. But it doesn't work in the end. Think this qualifies as a 'Great concept, poor execution' kind of game for me.  
2977	0	a	created an account...played this game..said i was too young to play..wouldn't let me..15...yet i still made the account....there's no way to delete it...soo...i'll never get to play it..thumbs down
2978	0	a	This game is deader than the zombie apocalypse, the nuclear fallout, or whatever disaster that decreases human population density up to 50 square miles per person per server region.   If you played the game right now, you will get to be a part of a special few that have spent too much money to let the game go. Also some people just can't play the game without 'trainers'.  You want to play with the same person every night? That have been playing years before you? Has tricks that you don't have? I guess this game is for you.   As a person that has been a commune to the game before, my warning of this game being a 'Gold' drainer has not been heeded 5 years ago. Buy permanent to win or pay premium to be financially stable to even participate in the whole item customization and selling experience.  Yes you will have to rent guns that expire weekly if you have not bought any. Expire weekly.  If not bought. Up to 20k gold for a gun. When a maximum amount possible weekly earned is a little 5k. Not counting the the little Cops and Robbers sideshow that earns more money than the actual missions, nobody does that anymore.   The new guns that came out on the market is to say 'Sorry but we are too lazy to fix the weapon balance, here buy these new ones instead'. Those guns are not 'rentable'. 
2979	0	a	First i would like to say this is one of the best games out there despite the Pay for more mindset of this game. costumization is crazy deep detailed but the default substcription you carry as a new player limits you to 25% of this games costumization capabilities. that aside there is also very anoying mechanics in this game specially playing as a bandit or criminal. a enforcer can handcaff you from miles away limiting your abillity to fight back or even try to brake restrains. little things like this are game braking. i havent spent much time in this game to give you a detailed idea of everything in this game. another thing that really bothers me is the community simply because its mostly filled with a very young community fan base. it bothers me i have to go online and play with 10 year olds. this game has the potencial to be the best game on steam for GTA fans and i think if taken in the right direction it would surpass GTA in many ways. i recommend it for a casual gamer not someone thats looking to take the most out of this game becouse that? .... well thats just impossible unless you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gold bars.......
2980	0	a	from the 'less than an hour' i played of this game, it has way too many problems for me. first off, in installing the game, it takes forever to download on even my connection, and i have 35mb/s up AND down. once it finally downloads, and is playable, i get some sort of registry error.   at this point, i was able to get into the game, the login system is a little strange. after a few minutes playing the game i got kicked from the server by punkbuster after dying, and am unable to rejoin the game. message i got was 'restriction:service abnormality'  i was hoping to give this game a good review, lokked really cool, but cant do that if i cant even get into the damn game.
2981	0	a	When I played it, I noticed it got more to the point where it was harder to play because only the older players or more experienced players still played it. Its cool and a bit fun but it got to me when I was being matched rarely against players the same level. 5/10
2982	0	a	I took all the garbage trucks (3 other friends )and drive around the biggest streets just destroying every vehicule I would see. Destroying every minute a person would have...messing with his gaming time...you can't do that anymore as theres no more garbage trucks...
2983	0	a	Fairfight? FAIRFIGHT?! Yeah, sure, if you consider a fair fight a team of gold threat players going up against a team of new guys/girls, then sure, but for MOST people, it's horrid! How does anyone expect to advance if these matches happen every single time? GamersFirst would be better off making the game singleplayer or co-op, in my opinion, and don't even get me started on the pay-to-win part, I'm not gonna waste my time complaing about that because no one would listen in the first place. And as I'mst looking at these other reviews, I see the same thing, Horrid matchmaking, Pay-to-win, and the only good thing being great customization.  Do NOT waste your time and money with this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I've been with APB since it's beta stages, and I say that I have a better chance stumbling on a long abandoned diamond mine in the middle of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ocean than actually progressing without paying a cent to APB.

2985	0	a	Not a good game. Much cheater, nobody to punish them. Glitch and cheat it's all you have to rememeber, people use auto aim and others glitch with game mecanical ( sit on the roof of a car to cancel a a debuff of speed)  COmmunity is very worst , people insult and just hit your car to make annoy you (its bring nothing just loosing you time)  THere is a mtchmaker in game but unfortunally it's the worst i never saw, you fight againt high level and high skilled people so you can't do nothing and you can't progress becasue oyu die every time.
2986	0	a	I've been playing since the RTW Edition, the community on the current APB is terrible, hackers are a common problem on APB, and G1 refuses to do anything about it, the guns are unbalanced and it is extremely repetitive. Matchmaking is terrible, you are paired with people not even close to your skill level. G1 Keeps adding guns that are pay to win, and refuses to fix the coding and scripting errors that this game boasts. They say they are making a physics engine update, however that Is a huge lie, they are showing little evidence to prove it and they said it would take a few months to implement, it has been a year atleast now. Their moderators are terrible, the one I will use as a example, Tiggs. She is a power hungry, abusive, and flat out â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ moderator, anyone with a opinion that differs from hers is banned, and if you have a question she uses her mother mentality of 'Because I said so.' Many people I know have filed reports to the better buisness bureau due to apbs incapability to help customers when they're money is taken from them and they dont recieve the product they pay for. G1 simply says its customer error and keeps your money.
2987	0	a	I did not enjoy my time with APB Reloaded  It was a great consept for a game but it had not only been done before but better  Pros: -Charater custamizion is very good and lots of diffrent thing to choose  -Meuns are nice -the ablity to create your own custom decals and put them on cars and your chartars cloths is nice  Cons:  -The city feels empty with little to no people walking around -The city is grey and not colour full  -the only place that is colour full in the game is the 'mall' where you buys cloths and such -the game play is boring -ALL the cars handle like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ -Mission Spawn system is broken and can lead to many spawn kills  -Mission arent that uniqe or fun  And this part needs its own place this game is complety PAY TO WIN you get all the best guns in the game by paying real money so basicly one guy will come buy every thing and destory EVERY ONE who is free to play   So I did not like ABP Reload once again the concept was good but had been done before and better is they wanted to base there game off of a good version of there concept they should have gone with gopham city imposters as that game was colour full, fun and did this concpet very very well so unless your willing to shell out a bunch of moeny i would not recommend

2992	0	a	I got this game and every time i played the game would freeze about 4 minutes into a district. It also made me have problems with my computer and i had to call the company's support to fix the problem. I do not recommend that you download or play this game unless your sure it'll work good on your computer.
2993	0	a	Honestly I love the idea of this game, it is a GREAT idea. I think, however, that it was poorly executed in many ways (displaying the single point to which you have to drive a slow, paper-armored car to the people whose job it was to blow up the car comes to mind, as well as the hitboxes which mean you were never REALLY behind cover).  Also word on the grapevine is that it's currently buggy beyond reason.  All this is a bloody pity because it had HUGE promise.
2994	0	a	i cant even play this game my server doesnt work

2996	0	a	If you enjoy constantly being pitted against players far above your skill level without your say and losing many, many matches before you even get a grip on how the game works, then this is your game. The matchmaking system is so flawed, it has effectively driven away anybody who might pose a fair, but not punishing, challenge against you.   Because of the matchmaking, this game has two difficulties in essence: Stupid Easy and Stupid Hard. Pick your poison.  The gameplay itself doesn't have much to it. Just level up contacts, shoot at some players once in a while, and do the same set of fetch quest, ram raid, or deathmatch objectives pretty much every mission. That is the meat of the game, and it's not subject to negotiation The game is based around PvP, and normally, it would be something you could have a bit of fun with after gathering up a few friends and duking it out in the streets like you're supposed to. But then we come back to the matchmaking issue, which takes the aspect of 'fair competition' and chucks it straight out the window.   It's also not a very well optimized game. I can accept when a game is simply too intense for my PC to handle, but this game certainly shouldn't be on the list of 'I need to turn A LOT of settings down before I can play' games. I'm not running on a potato, either. It's just terribly optimized. So, word of warning, do not expect to run this at high and get smooth frames on anything less but the most rugged of gaming rigs with a lot of resources to burn.   The best thing I can say about it, really, is the customization. It truly is the one aspect that takes this mediocre game a step up into the realm of competitively mediocre. 'Course, don't expect to make any particularly insanely awesome character outfits without dropping real money or grinding the game's endlessly monotonous objectives, all while battling the world's worst player matchmaking system.  Until this game gets its crap together with the supposedly upcoming engine update, I can't recommend this title, even in its free-to-play format. Play it if you want, but prepare to get annoyed.
2997	0	a	PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME !!!! This game was really bad, i think this game same like GTA. But, this game just like trash with big size on my PC. And also, the customize characters doesnt like Saints Row. And I really hated about lag connection.
2998	0	a	Don't bother downloading this pay2win, full of cheaters piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2999	0	a	Absolutely terrible balancing, poorly polished, and just not very fun to play. This game had the most potential out of any free to play game on steam, but everything that couldve been was poorly executed. Gunplay is average, weapon balance in this game makes call of duty look like Blacklight retribution. If you have about 60 dollars to drop on this game for better weapons and vehicles, go right ahead and play this game because the best weapons cost about 15 dollars
3000	0	a	This game it's so annoying you are playing you are killing some enemys and then there is a guy that he has given his soul to this game and you are hitting him over and over again and you spend 1 million bullets hitting and he is still allive and he is only looking at you and he is killing you!! Just do not play this game trust me !!!!!!NEVER!!!!!!
3001	0	a	haha...yes there are screenshots and videos, when it comes to the game, lets take a seat and discuss things...  first, you download the game from steam.  second you have to install the company's gaming site (their version of steam).  third you must download the game from their site.  fourth you must install another version of Gamers Live   fifth you realize you spent three days downloading two versions of a game that when started runs error codes which have no repairs except reinstall the game  sixth you spend a couple of hours searching through the programs to uninstall it after you uninstalled it  seventh you find that to this day it continues to run in your background ._.
3002	0	a	I got to say that this game has became a really bigger garbage of game since i stopped playing it for like almost a year and when got back into it the hackers known as some of my friends were and are still on and hacking. This fairfight piece of garbage only do 40% of it's job and what else the premium weapons now come with a aimboot mod in it, G1 really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed this game up all they want is money from you but can't spend it on fixing this bugs and the game physics i been playing this game since 2011 a year after it came out and i gotta say it was the best PVP, MMO game i ever played i used to have no life and play it all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing day till it became a complete piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 2 years later. Hackers started to hack just because of the Pay to Win situation but all though i have to thank G1 a lot for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing this game up thanks a lot G1.
3003	0	a	I have dep problem.game not work
3004	0	a	This game is one-sided and a pay to win. If you have good guns you win... not cool
3005	0	a	The typical pay-2-win game. The only game that stats in a weapon mean absolutely nothing. You get into the game and your first prize is to try out the premium membership for 1 day. I have no idea what it gives, neither what advantages I can gather from it. And then, there you go into a confusing game where everything is random. Your party is picked randomly, missions are picked randomly, your level is random. And the tutorial won't help you to understand this case.  The game claims to have a matchmaking on, but you will always randomly join noobs in your team and play against pros. The server itself is lagging awfully, it's hard to control cars or even his own character. The map is fine but not entirely used, some places are useless. Finally, people on the chat are psychotic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that cry if someone is better than them because they spent so much money that they wouldn't accept to be beaten anymore. Also, it's full of hackers.  I won't even try again.

3010	0	a	Horrible experience. Very bad matchmaking. Graphics reminiscent of 2007. Character interaction with world on par with original CounterStrike game. To reach its extended character and vehicle customization you either have to pay or suffer endless hours of humiliation in missions against much better equipped opponents.
3011	0	a	I played this game for a very short time, but i can say for sure certain its a waste of time, the bugs are horrible graphics are glitched and things can appear blurred on high spec machines the gameplay between the two factions is also disgracefully unbalanced. its more P2W not F2P.

3018	0	a	Game becomes a trollfest regardless of which side you pick. Can be fun. Everything just devolves into trolling. That's if the game works. If it does, try not to go over 60mph considering the massive lags spikes which hilarisouly throw everyone on server into walls every five to ten minutes.  Like I said though, game can be fun.  Be warned: there are many, many people playing together as cops and robbers 'boosting'.
3019	0	a	IF you paid or invested a ton of time into it, you can play it. If not be prepaired to face horrible ballance issues and get bullied around CONSTANTLY. Did i mention next to no player physics, no tutorial, no clue of WTF is going on. Maybe im just tired, but it has some serious frustrating issues from the start that make for a agrivating experiance.
3020	0	a	The game has potential but like so many other Free-To-Play games it suffers from poor performace, Pay-To-Win players, and several game breaking bugs such as exploitable invisible walls and suceptibility to aim-bots amongst other hacks. The game has so much potential to be fun, and to make the dev's money if they would just put in the effort to make the game fair and balanced. The matchmaking system is broken as well. The district you choose is supposed to match you against equally skilled opponents, but in a world full of hacks cheats and obnoxious children this hardly makes a difference. You will get matched up against pros every time because they are the only players left as the new players get scared away by everything I just mentioned.

3027	0	a	The most Pay 2 Win game ever created in Universe, if you like to be killed in 0,05 sec by a Player who bought premium weapons than this is your pick! Enjoy repetative missions while being called noob cause you didn't pay to win, unload 7 clips of ammo in to one guy who then kills you with 2 shots from a pistol. Only thing that is fine in the game is costumization options. This game is the worst crap ever ressurected to be a Money Milking Machine. Don't play this game.
3028	0	a	I installed this game as soon it was released as free to play, but the game was pay to win from day one so I eventually stopped, and I'll explain why.  I understand that this game needs pay to win elements in order to recoup costs and generate revenue, but there is a universal line which the company has unfortunately crossed.  Pay to win items in this game include fast cars and premium firearms far deadlier than the stock firearms which otherwise would have taken days to weeks to earn, if at all. Not only that, all weapons are subscriptions that need to be renewed. That is the line that should never be crossed. Pay to win elements should never award any significant advantage over the default elements. If it does, the quality of gameplay is flushed down the toilet and it's not a real game anymore.  In summary, the only way to be good in this game is to buy the deadly premium weapons on which the company has unabashedly placed exorbitant pricing, and apparently most players do so every day. It is the only way to have any amount of fun in this game, unless you enjoy being unfairly DM'ed.  And this is from my experiences a few years ago, which I haven't written about at the time because the review system hadn't existed then, plus I haven't thought of writing one until now. The system hasn't changed, nor will it ever, because why would the company scrap the system that generates probably the majority of their dirty profit? Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this one game, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere to satisfy your daily cravings of online shooter fun.
3029	0	a	So I once had a good review of this game, but I have to change it I'm afraid.  I have well over 400 hours into the game (Played before it was on stea to track my hours) so I'm not someone coming in talking out of their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ angry about pay to win.  I have spent money on this game  I have earned a lot of the same stuff outside of spending money  I have leveled both a Crim and and Enf 1 max one close to it.    This game is a shell of its former self, and really there is no game like it still, but you should still look elsewhere. I won't scream hackers, because they've gotten good at banning them, but there are still a few cases where it is far past questionable, especially from the same few people that somehow stick around (I've played long enough to know good from hackker).  I won't say the game is entirely pay to win, and this is coming from someone who HAS paid into the game, but I will say it has gotten damn close, especially the past year. New guns come out that you can only buy, their are not great earning eqvuilanets, and the few that are in some cases can take you as many hours as I have into the game, not including mods, and making the money to rent them constantly.  It isn't a terrible game, but sadly it is run buy a company that seems more focused on their shop than their game. Still the same tired maps this many years later, still the same tired missions that get old and are easily exploitable if you know them well enough (some sides WILL easily win if they are defending/attackin for example). The company running this game seems to have given up on impleneting anything new into the game outside of guns they sell you with real money, and seem to have all but given up on the idea of expanding the game or adding content, which is sad. Game STILL has potentially, simply because no one else does this really, outside of GTA 5 online, but the devs need to realize they are running a game server, not a cash shop.
3030	0	a	Whoop de doo. I played this game before it came to steam, but I couldn't write a review because I hadn't played it on steam. Great.  So I installed it, started it up, shut it down and uninstalled it.  That's right, I never went to actually play it here in steam. Why? Because, if it's only half as bad as I remember, then you want to stay far away from this game.  Bad matchmaking, elitst jerks, hackers, money hungry developers, and much more. The company making it calls themselves ''gamersfirst''  ... Don't get me started. but hey, if you're filthy rich and don't know what to spend all your money on. This game is it.  I won't bother telling anything else, everyone who's given this game a thumbs down is summing it up pretty nicely.  It's too bad, really. I loved the concept, and I always enjoy character customizations with few limits.

3037	0	a	This game was a HUGE waste of my time. I couldn't even play because the servers kept kicking me out. Any time I DID get into a game, I was disconnected in 30 seconds.
3038	0	a	Game lags like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ even on beast computers, community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but mainly because the developers are absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... lying about progress, making excuses not talking to community as well as randomly banning players without providing evidence, game is quite a dictatorship with poor decisions on the development team who refuse to listen to the players.
3039	0	a	PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK  The game is filled with foul-mouthed creatures that, if you have very, very low patience, will infuriate you to no end. Despite the multitude of weapons available for free-to-play players, the best weapons you'll find will be either in the in-game marketplace costing ridiculous amounts (yes, i'm looking you all who expect so much for such a simple weapon) or in Armas Marketplace which costs real money. The lag is terrible, causing rubberbanding effect, which is very, very annoying in and out of missions. Not to mention higher level players invade the lower level ones and calls people who can't shoot them down losers or noobs. Matchmaking is bad. Low level players are often pitted against higher ranking ones.  It's not a bad game, all in all. Like many other MMORPGs, it is plague with many problems. On the up side, this game has by far the best customization I've seen out there. It's just insane with how many things you can do that you will literally spend hours just to design your clothes. There's always a lot of action going on and different faction-specific tasks you can do.  I don't recommend this game for casual players. However, if you are a fan of profanity, hours of dressing up your toon just to shoot the hell out of people, then feel free to play it.
3040	0	a	okay honestly, i really dont like this game, i really only play it for the character graphics, and car graphics. because besides that the gunplay is homestly horrible, guns have horrible accuracy, the gaming commuinty in cancer and the maps are small boring and repitive. but the absolute WORST thing about this game.  is how big the company who made it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s you out for money. i mean many people will tell you that its not pay to win, and i mean thats kinda true, you get rent guns with in game money, so you odnt ever need to use real money, however if you want to get a gun that you can keep, well then my friend you are going to pay a arm and a nutt for it, because in this cruel world, ONE gun, yes only ONE! will cost you the totaly fair price of 20 EFFING DOLLARS!!! FOR ONE GUN!!! so i mean, pl0x save yourself the time and money and just buy the better version of this game gta V and you will get guns that you can keep for FREE!!
3041	0	a	I played this on its first release and it really broke my heart when it went down for the first time. This was my game and I loved it!  Needless to say I was super excited when I heard that I was going to be revived. It really felt good in the first four to six weeks. I could live with having to rent guns instead of just buying them (ingame-$$$-wise). Then people got greedy and you couldnt even compete with your rented guns. Noobs were â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Golds with their freshly bought gold-guns. Thats when the game died a second time and my heart was shredd.   Didnt touch it for about two years, although I could barely hold me back every now and then... Today I couldnt resist and I jumped into the forums to get a quick glimpse of the game's state. Reading these comments saved my heart from being torn apart a third time. Thank you guys!   TLDR: Sob-story about an awesome game that has been killed by its developers, twice! 2 years of F2P just made it a lot worse.
3042	0	a	For some reason one day i joined and i kept disconnecting after 5 sec of the game,someone fix it cause i would really like to go back to the game with my teamates
3043	0	a	It's a game that you play a whole lot for a weekend then never go back to it.
3044	0	a	its a great game but its frickin pay to win every team i go against im sniped by a gold weapon which has perfect stats so either nerf these weapons or make them rewards because im sick of it. DONT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY  
3045	0	a	Until this became 'pay to win' it was a very enjoyable game. I spent many hours with friends running down cons in our pimped out squad cars. I was happy to pay the minor monthly fee back then for that bit of near hackerless fun and no PTW store. I noticed a lot of 'features' cost $ that before the changeover didn't, a way to make an extra buck for the devs I guess.
3046	0	a	This game is the drunken asian Grand Theft Auto. (No racism intended). The tutorial gives you a nice feel for the game, which is good, i liked that, but the game itself has a large delay, driving is near broken, and the graphics, arent all that great at all. I mean hey its played by lots of people, but personally this is just a waste of time.
3047	0	a	This game gave me cancer. It is simply awful. I do NOT recommend it.

3050	0	a	Tons of character variety. Fun PvP.  Downside? Falls into the Pay to win category, which just isn't for me.
3051	0	a	When i joined this, it was fun, but it forced me to have to buy more ram just to play, but even then i lagged during any battle..  reason i dont reccomend this: SUPER cpu heavy, it lags bad if you dont have a serious up to date graphic card or more then 8gb ram, seems they put alot into graphics which causes older computers or people who dont buy computers every year not able to play it.  i still login from time to time, but it became un-fun when it was nothing but trolls bashing your car/truck into walls with garbage trucks, or children screaming on the voice system just to annoy you.  i dont reccomend this if you have a older cpu, or cant handle the graphics, also if you cant deal with kiddy trolls bashing you every 5 mins not allowing you to do anything.
3052	0	a	A great game with a super awesome amount of customization. However the pay-2-win model ruins most the game.

3062	0	a	1,300 hours later and I still manage to want to play this game. Customization is fantastic and it's one of the main aspects of this game along with the 'run-n-gun' style of third-person shooting. The graphics are unupdated, the optimization is horrible and has been for an extended period of time, the matchmaking has yet to be improved, micro purchases out of your â™¥â™¥â™¥, if you have the G1C that is. A community of some veterens but mostly hackers and rerollers with 5 dollar wall hacks, aimbots, or a 40 dollar trial gun. The game itself is fantastic but the key aspects around it are dragging it down.
3063	0	a	while the game itself is good, with great character customization. it's a massively pay to win mess. you have to pay real money to get decent guns. and the only way to get those guns without paying them wheel barrels of cash are to get joker tickets. and to get those, you need to play for hours almost non stop in one of their special gamemodes. most likely against hackers. the pay to win vehicles that as far as i know, can't be bought with tickets, have massive built in ability that vastly out perform the non play to win vehicles. the community is cancerous that gives LoL a run for it's money. you will no doubt be accused of hacking at least once, regardless of if you're actually hacking. the actual hackers basically rule the game while gamer's first has money shoveled in from overpriced P2W ingame guns and cars.

I don't even think if I should really call it a game. It is like modern art... You pay a lot of money, but it is still nothing.
3071	0	a	Servers keep going down due to ddoser been hours and days its been happning. There staff cant do crap about it. The company is to cheap to get real ddos protection or better hosting and i think theres a virus in the game due to reports and some one got there credit card stolen. I loved the game but you cant even play and there company wont do anything about it. Plus the games pay to one hit some one basicly.

They blame other people and cant even fix the promblem themselves even indy games have better protection than this garbage.
3072	0	a	Used to be a good game since I had nothing else to do. Now that I have Csgo, this is utter BS. Dont play this. It is basically a game where people who pay for their guns will always win. Spend a little money and actually get a good game you will like rather than play these free games.
3073	0	a	Practically the best Pay to Win game ever! If you're broke, you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed! :D

3080	0	a	Horrible game didn't even install correctly. It wanted me to install physx which i did then it told me to restart my computer which i also did and it still didn't work. I uninstalled it and will never even touch this game with a 10 foot pole.
3081	0	a	My complains -The game wont even start -idunno why but it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed my pc a little up -it always wants me to like on facebook  i now that i sould say the game is bad cus i didnt played it,but i cant even start it so what the â™¥â™¥â™¥!?!?!
3082	0	a	A game with great potential, ruined by what only can be described as incompetent developers. This game is mechanically unbalanced and unintentionally designed to bring out the worst in people, and despite the crappy engine the game is built upon that would prevent quick changes on larger scale issues, the game still commits simple game design sins, the biggest one being selling mechanics as premium items.  This is the ONE THING YOU DONT DO IN A F2P GAME, it's the quickest way to unbalance the game beyond the developers control, and the prices in the store are beyond extortionate and exploitative. Despite the various lead developers and community managers that move in and out of the company (which really makes you wonder what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is going on), apparently no-one collectively sees this as enough of an issue to fix.  It's sad then that it's still the MMO i've played for the most time, but to be honest im hoping now that another much more intelligent developer will make something that encapsulates the brilliance of this games concept and actually be able to make it good, as i've given up on hoping Reloaded Games recognises these elements as actual problems.
3083	0	a	i thought it would be fun, but when i get a gun with the money you can get ingame easy and take all of it to own a gun that i can keep for 1 week but to keep it for good i have to pay real money thats just bad. the customization is decent but you need a membership thing. the openworld is horrible, theres no penalty for killing people like a cop chase or even getting money for killing people. the map is full of nothing, and playing as a cop is the same as playing as a crook, you can rob random civs for money and everyone avoids everyone exept the people who pay real money for better guns and cars, they just pick on you until you quit. save your time and dont put this in your library
3084	0	a	-Newbie unfriendly -PvP and matchmaking is horrible since it can easily get one sided once the game throws high level players agains low level players (found myself doing a mission, half an hour after I started playing the game, where I was up against three high level players, resulting in one shot kills on their side) -Driving mechanics are like strapping your b0ll0cks to a car battery.  -Weapon handling is, well, like removing the car battery, then strapping your b0ll0cks to a machine gun and wildly shaking your pelvis whilst hoping that the only thing youll shoot in your frenzy is the apple on your son's head.  Only good thing in this game is the customization possibilities, as long as you sell one of your b0ll0cks to be able to afford it.

3097	0	a	If you trade legendary items you get banned for scamming. So either buy it with ingame money or don't trade weapons at all.
3098	0	a	Not really good, the game just throws you in with no explanation of what to do. Everyone is running around with p2w weapons which can one shot you, your start weapons are absolute useless shot my whole magazine in guy and he didnt even flinch.Also the grenade spam is preposterous everytime you come near a objective you are greeted by thousands of grenades... Loading times are waaay too long which is strange considering that the graphic arent that great. All in all I didnt had a good time also the community are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.
3099	0	a	Strike three! The game won't let me even play it.   Okay people make a game that you simply INSTALL and then it PLAYS with no problems.   SO many other game makers do that.    Make a character, choose a name, choose a zone. Then NOTHING. The NEXT button never lights up.   The other times the stupid game said I had another account it was under. Did I sign in with another accout? No.   Looks like it could be cool but I don't have all eon to try and get onto this game. Now how do I delete this and forget it for good.
3100	0	a	100% AWFUL is what you will get when you play this game.... ARE YOU READY TO GET REKT CONSTANTLY BY PLAYERS WITH WEAPONS THAT FAR OUTCLASS ANY SORT OF SKILL? ARE YOU READY TO DO NOTHING BUT DIE AND DIE AND DIE WITH A REVOLUTIONARY MATCHMAKING SYSTEM THAT ONLY MATCHES YOU WITH PLAYERS FAR BEYOND YOUR SKILL AND GEAR SO THEY CAN R*PE YOU FOR EASY MONEY AND POINTS WHILE YOU RAGE AND TRY SO HARD TO DO SOMTHING, ANYTHING TO NOT HAVE YOU GAME EXPERIENCE TURN INTO A KEYBOARD SMASHING SIMULATOR? THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!!!  I've tried for over 75hrs to enjoy this game and to no avail, people that have been playing this game longer than you will absolutely destroy you no matter what you do. The ONLY features that I had a fun/challenging time with was the custimization YES my Char looked so cool and so did my truck! but thats not what this F*CKING GAME IS ABOUT!!! so yeah, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME to anyone unless you are MLG sponsored or are a glutton for punishment or you wanna spend all your time customizing your char and car.
3101	0	a	This game is extremly unbalanced. When ever you start a mission against someone there is no ranking system, it's only randomized where you and your friends that are new to the game fight agains players that have spent hours and cash on this game. And even after a while when you have played the game the other players have to strong weapons and vehicals for you to even do anything.  With that said  -Unbalanced -Pay to win  
3102	0	a	I am sick i this shity game because ost of the robbers are hackers useing thier aim bot and it so easy for them to get money and who idea was it to have a rocket launcher thats thing is too over powered  Fix this game  JarJarGamer
3103	0	a	Pay to win. Imbalanced. Full of hackers and bad attitudes.  Could be fun with private matchmaking where you can choose who you play, but it isn't fun at all.

3106	0	a	This game is just bad. First time I tried it, filled with adds promoting there FaceBook page so on. This game is full of rubbish like this. I wouldn't recommend, even if it is a F2P
3107	0	a	Pay to play garbage. I hope you like renting weapons, because that's all you're going to get to do unless you drop real cash. The combat is third person awkward and boreing.
3108	0	a	Before, this game was great. Good community, good updates. Now it's the complete opposite.  Unless you want to play the same thing over and over, same mission and what not, go ahead. But it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Usually the maximum of 7 people on fighting districts. The only thing that's good is the exit button.
3109	0	a	This game was the best ive ever played until they started rolling out the Pay to Wins thats when everything went to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. i means really the matching making was horrible. people blatantly hacking, and the server lags. with the so much money they get on this game they choose not to fix it. i tried to tell them on facebook but they block me from commenting on anything they post. i guess they dont want to hear a fan of the game opinion about their game. i would have recommended this game in a heartbeat but now its just a Pay to Win Simulator
3110	0	a	used to be my favorite games before... but later in 2013 they ruined everthing, starting from the weapons they make the normal weapons do less range and damage from the weapon u buy from the market using real money, the lags, the random kicking in the middle of mission by punkbuster, and the worst part is the hacker that didnt get banned because they friends of the GM or they spent money on premium. now im gone for good. (colby player)
3111	0	a	i used to think this game was great, but i was extremely wrong  the community is terrible, if you lose or win you have a good chance to get either a generic 'gg' which isnt too bad, or you will get insulted. what makes this even worse is that there is no rule about being nice to other players at all  the matchmaking is even worse, any rank can visit any server even if the server is dedicated to a rank lower than them. this means that a silver rank can join a bronze rank server and absolutely destroy everyone  driving is sloppy because if you lag a lot you have a 100% chance to crash into a building and kill a few civillians  this is what really changed my mind the most, the criminal faction when i started playing as a criminal, i was followed by enforcers non-stop so they could witness and then kill me without giving me a chance to even blink  this game could be a lot better if the devs actually put a lot more thought into the game
3112	0	a	Gamers Last. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this garbage.
3113	0	a	Pay to win, pretty cancer.
3114	0	a	This game is all good except for the fact that I got a bug from it where it tells my friends that I am playing APB all the time, regardless of what I'm playing now. It also wont let me delete it because of the fact that it still thinks that I am in-game.
3115	0	a	Avoid this game like the plague. The shooting mechanics are horrible, and the objective fighting is bland. For something that shouts out MMO GTA it just feels empty as hell, with the largest battle I had being two versus two. SHIITTTTT
3116	0	a	The game play component has two modes, join a mission district and press k to get shot at, or join an action district and have the game press k for you, so you can get shot at sooner, as well as having more people to shoot at you. As for the ranking system, with the aid of mommys credit card it can join the plot over in the corner, ever so often clear its throat and stretching a little , and mumbling something along the lines of 'this game isnt pay to win, you can unlock all the weapons as you progress through the game' to which you will reply 'what about the weapons i cant unlock through the game' right before resumes its silent vigil. All points bullitin caters to a unique few, the extremely rich, the extremely close, and the devs, the cash shop redundifies any and all attempts at proggression, while also placing some out of reach weaponery into the game, as for the joker store...suffice to say its a joke (see what i did there). All Lag Bullitin has optomization issues, that would give the dialup era of online gaming a run for its money when it comes to unreliability, the server is secretly the worlds most advanced rng as it has awareness, but many years of neglect have lead it to become resentful of humanity and thus you will find in your moment of need, when you are soo close to murdering Xx_rApEdyeMUMm8_xX and restoring honor to you family the server will get distracted and forget to register... well anything, and after a quick game of he said she said you are shuffled along to the respawn screen, the game is horribly unreliable unless you the lucky few, then you have nothing to worry about youll be sything down noobs and veterans alike blessed by the almighty apb god we call server, with the lag armor. Having said all this there are some good points to apb such as the customization.... yup thats the only redeeming quality, if this were a fashion world simulator it would be enough, but in a badly optimized tps (third person shooter) it just means you'll look pretty while your ragdoll lays on the floor, and theres not much else to redeem the game.  in conclusion the devs are bad, the game mechanics are bad, the servers are bad, the community is   toxic garbage, left behind by the civilized word, gained sentience and decided to stage a perverse mockery of a community   bad, the funeral clothes creater is indepth and well designed.    TL;DR the games bad, unless you spend your time in bronze, then you can enjoy countless hours of blissful ignorance, while you skip along to the sound of angry 12 yearolds
3117	0	a	The game seemed pretty decent right off the bat. Then I played a little longer and realized, it is a rushed piece of crap that should have never been released. It has potential however thats like saying Michael Jordan had potential at baseball BS he sucked at baseball. The game could have been something much better. All I am saying is that if it hadn't been rushed and it had a little bit more put into it, is that it would be a great GTA alternative or at least that's what I think             Sincerely, AnTixRushed
3118	0	a	So the game is getting some serious age right now. Decided to take the game for a spin today, to check if network issues has been fixed. Again!  Took my car for a drive, going to check if I could get to the closest gas station without crashing.  Another player appeared in front of me, driving. None of us didn't even bother to touch the steering wheel, but went flat out crossing our fingers in a head to head collision. This is how bad the lag is.  Unplayable.
3119	0	a	It was really good when It first came out. but It wasn't even THAT good. It was certainly something new and innovative for it's time but now its just a pay2win cash cow with the occasional cheater mixed in on top of the already nearly impossible to beat pay2win crowd. It still has some awesome features unrelated to the main game such as the customization of your character. (see my publics screenshots on this game to get an idea) You can have your own crew, and cars customized to match. There are ton's of cool guns and lots of cars. You can make friends in the game and just chill out at the social district, or race around the city. But these days not many people play and the streets are mostly empty. which isn't really the games fault. It's just older now. If you like highly customizable games and you have some friends to play with, I would say give it a shot. but for the average player who want's to just enjoy the core game, I would say look somewhere else. preferably at the new Grand Theft Auto.
3120	0	a	Haven't even had a chance to play because the registry is.... 'unusual' or for a better discriptive term, it's garbage. I've been waiting for over half an hour for my verification email and nothing has shown up so far. So before I even get a chance to play I already have my review made up for this, uh, game.. I mean I really can't complain much because I see a game that is free to play ES Online, and how garbage that turned out, but at least with this I didn't waste my cash on a $60 game only to not be able to sign in due to lack of servers. BUT that doesn't excuse the fact that I want to give this game APB a chance, but I'm very disheartened due to the fact I have yet to get a verification email. THUMBS DOWN!   I might make another review and change it later after my hair turns grey from waiting..,
3121	0	a	This is a 'freemium' game. It's free, but you have to pay for the good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to win
3122	0	a	lel scraped it m8
3123	0	a	APB Reloaded is a great game, one that you will find yourself returning to play over and over again. Then..... You will find yourself rage quit'ing in disgust. Hackers run rampant throughout the game in groups, the games (Fair-fight) system never seems to get the blatantly obvious players. I have over 1000 hours on the game between both my enforcer and criminal chars. While playing tonight three seperate groups were running around trolling the financial district. Hmmmm, killing people at 80m with a short range weapon, no recoil on that machine gun, pistols that never miss, etc. etc... These are pretty obvious, and after years of playing this game, I have to say that its obvious the Developers who have taken over dont care. Not worth your time people, my suggestion do not get sucked into this game.
3124	0	a	BEWARE!  I played this game for about 2 weeks, I even bought into this game, and the item shop. (Yes, it is pay to win)  However I was banned under the PunkBuster system it was then using. It now uses FairFight, but I don't know if that will make much of a difference. My experience with the Customer Service was atrocious. First they told me I was banned because I was 'observed cheating' then later told I was never observed, but rather it was a PunkBuster ban. Their recommended appeal process was to follow up with PunkBuster. When following up with PunkBuster they could not produce a 'report'. I also played many other games that at the time were using PunkBuster and did not produce any bans on any of these other games.   As mentioned in other reviews, I believe this is because there is a very active and corrupt team running this game. The slightest bit of e-sluethery will net you many posts regarding these accusations. The community is dying slowly from this and it is quite sad. Because the game itself is actually quite entertaining and a decent time sink if it weren't for such poor mismanagement from day 1 through now.
3125	0	a	Many years have passed since I played the Closed Beta version of APB. Then I played the full version, released by EA. It was a good game, a fun game. I played with my good friends. We had a great time playing as enforcers, hunting down bandits. The whole concept of this ambitious game was brilliant. There was a lot of guns, cars and customization items. Sure, you didn't get everything from the start. You had to earn money to buy better equipement and other stuff. But it wasn't painfully hard. Now, when this game is Free To Play it suddenly became game only for rich kids. If you want to play this game for free, just forget about it. There is no fun for you there. I hate it when a decent game is dgraded to a 'free' to play crap like this.

3129	0	a	Don't waste your time, people figured out how to speed hack, now you can't do anything about beating them. At least when it was just aim botting you could out smart them. Can't even boot them from your team unless they TK first. Fair Fight is a joke. Uninstalling.
3130	0	a	No real updates for years, mostly based on pay to win. Gets very repetitve, but a decent play at times. Community is mostly bad due to the fact that no one will show you any kind of mercy, but there area few friendly players who try help. I strongly recommend not spending any money on this game if playing at all.
3131	0	a	Not Getting Any Steam Achievement don't pop up.......

3133	0	a	Doesn't accept passwords, takes forever to load on SATA III SSD.
3134	0	a	0.01/10  This game is one of the worst 3rd person shooter ever made. The developers don't listen to the community and what the community wants in the game. The over-pricing of guns and clothes in the ARMAS market is rediculous (DON'T BUY ANYTHING WITH REAL MONEY). The server lag is insane and sometimes hard to deal with. Also, the amount of hackers you see is stupid and made me want to hack sometimes. The only good thing about this game is the customisation feature, but you have to pay for a premium to add more than like 10 decals to your car. This game is extremely pay to win, if you want anything good you have to pay with real money to get it.  Looking back now, I don't see any reason of how i could have played it for as long as I did.  I will never play it again.  
3135	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.
3136	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.
3137	0	a	The Unbearable lag renders what should be an amazing game unplayable. Tragic.

3143	0	a	Full of hacks,Admins doing no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game
3144	0	a	I played the game before it was reloaded. Lets just say that while not playing the game I enjoyed much better games made by a developer that don't ban you because you asked them why you got an email from them.  Lets say this from when I did play. The controls suck it has no controller support to make driving better.  The graphics are not terrible but they could be better.  The physics engine used is a joke.

3146	0	a	i made an account, went to validate my account , it said 'page not found ' i repeated it couple of times... didn't work, i went for help to the website but to get help i need to be logged in... 10/10 amazing gameplay (sarcasm)
3147	0	a	This game Is a peach of work.... You start out as bronze but you face gold players the matchmaking sucks...... And its full of hacker's
3148	0	a	It is a huge pay to win game and it is boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you dont add moeny. 0/10 hate alot...
3149	0	a	The customization level of this game is unmatched by any other game. Unfortunely thats the whole highlight of the game. The gun play is really horrible, with terrible gun balance and lots of bunny hoppers. The matchmaking is an aboslute joke. The driving is sub par, but playable. The maps are great for driving around on, but not really fun for gun battles. The whole of the game from start to finish is random groups of people gunning down other random groups while safe neutrals troll you. Lastly the marketplace prices are insane. $20-$30 USD to unlock one gun for your account, Their supposed to bring out a new engine at some point to fix a lot of the issues, but until then its just not worth playing.
3150	0	a	I will say this, I wanted to go back to this game after playing it during my highschool days and dropping it after say a few months.  The game is amazing on customization as in beautifully stunning in the fact that EVERYTHING can be changed with your character (Clothing to body) and Cars and guns (albeit with premium limitations on designing) but beyond sitting in the hub far from the sh!tstorm that is the open world of APB:R, there isn't much more to be said about it, if anything I would rather pick up the game just to twiddle with the fun customization stuff you can do than hoping and praying that I can have a fun firefight with all kinds of players that isn't laggy or one sided on who has a sniper/rocket launcher or an ARMAS bought gun.
3151	0	a	Sorry but this is a joke, after many hours of downloading, it installed and started updating which was fine by me, seemed normal, until the update got to 100% and nothing happened, it started saying 'installing Direct X' which i obviously already have. After maybe 20 minutes of confusion i looked around the steam forums, followed some advice, but this time when i clicked play, it bought up the same download window and just started downloading something different. After this it successfully ended, however the game STILL won't play. It either does nothing or says the application is already running (which it isn't.)  Pretty disgraceful, i downloaded Left 4 Dead 2 without a problem and it works fine. APB seems to be severely fukced. I know it's free to play but you still expect it to actually work after the installation progress.   EDIT: Just found out that on this game you have to pay REAL LIFE money for IN GAME guns, games like this should be ended. Money grabbing bull****.  ANOTHER EDIT: So yeah since this i've downoaded many games via Steam, none had any sort of problem what so ever, games i've downloaded and am able to run normally include Rust, Outlast, The Forest, Next Car Game, Battlefield 3, the list goes on, APB goes in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ list with gaming atrocities like Velvet Sundown who wouldn't even run.
3152	0	a	the perfect game for someone who has days of free time just to get enough money to buy a small amount of things  4.5/10000000
3153	0	a	I Can Just Say 'Bad Game'! Nobody play it!!!!!
3154	0	a	Bad Community, Bad Servers, Good Game. Don't play without doing so with someone expirienced.
3155	0	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks u cant download it it is a gllitch 
3156	0	a	If you see an hour played, thats the time ive tried starting the game and cant even play it -.-
3157	0	a	Honestly, I really like this game. Its free to play and fun to play but it always glitches and lags too much to even pretend to play. If it wasnt for that Id highly recomend it but there seems to be no fix for the lag and whatnot 
3158	0	a	i play this game often but its fun, but there is one major thing i dont like in a PVP F2play. ITS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PAY TO WIN. There is no form of pve(maybe a bit for crims so mug and steal) like there is nothing to fight when you aren't in machmaking. (oh and before i forget SPEND 1,000+ DOLLORS TO INJOY THIS GAME IN PVP). The matching in this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gold like to farm kills in new and bronze lvl sever(G1 fix that) most thing in arms is over priced and OP(i TRIED some) there is also lots of grinding for f2p players. And let me not forget. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IN ONE VIDEO GAME AT A TIME ITS SAD ALL THEY DO IS TALK â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND GO AFTER NOOBS. AND THEN INSULT YOU ITS SAD. Oh and dont get me started on bountys. &gt;_&gt; thats all i gotta say(wen you have a bounty no one can help you now kiddys .-.)  Now some good things(the few reasons i keep playing this game BUT havent spent a peny on it). The costumisation(it also has cons on to it). It is nice the fact you get to costimize your character BUT for F2P platers its limmited.   THE CARS(I LOVE MY CAR &lt;3) cars they have nice cars in game when you unlock them. (as a crim) MUGGING AND STEALING-FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN, BUT hold up there are some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥(if the car isnt owned by you) who will take from that car you stole and stored stuff in. They can also blow it up even if its yours or not. NOW FOR A LIST OF MORE CONS IN GAMEPLAY #1-Hit box-delay #2-aiming-SHOOT INTO THE WALL WILL YAH #3Cover-DONT HIDE FROM A SNIPER BEHIND A CAR they can still get ya #4-Pay 2 Win- OP guns in arms anot enough good ones in game #5-SSSPAWNING(more in fight club) GET READ TO BE STAWN KILLED #5-The matchmaking- unfair matchup (one team new players other golds). #6(im not to sure on this one) HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAXXXXXXX-from what ive heard that is. although ive seen some imposible stuff(no not like 360 noscope like in cod like shooting through walls always knowing where you are aimbot(i think)).  Over all I would recomend it but it has alot to fix, so its up to you if you wanna play it. And plz try to have fun dont take anything sereusly mainly because its a game.   (i just want car parts new clothes and drive around fancy looking is that to much to ask in a game).   (i am sorry for my spelling)   5/10
3159	0	a	pay2win game with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of hackers  although it's probably the best of it's genre with the features provided in the game, it's still shitinfested with tons of faggs and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dev team  tons of faggs, meaning that the game has probably one of the worst communities in mmo history
3160	0	a	Game won't load. But I wouldn't say its bad. Just putting thumbs down because it won't start up.
3161	0	a	This is the 9/11 of video games.
3162	0	a	Would recommend if it weren't for so many hackers and auto-aimers. Almost a good game.. Almost.  8/10 Game 5/10 Game with it's current community
3163	0	a	no,it was OKKKKKKKKKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Y ,well 
3164	0	a	i wasted 45 mins of my life on this game....
3165	0	a	its like gta but this game is awful
3166	0	a	Even after it becamne free to play it is still not worth it, do not waste your time on this.
3167	0	a	Why cant i play it WHY!!!
3168	0	a	Absolutly the worst match making system I've ever seen on ANYTHING, me and my friends just constantly going back and forth between gold and silver while really low level facing level 100+ enemies with pay to win guns on gold and losing and facing what feel like noobs in silver then going back to gold again, gameplay wise it's not too bad but it's unplayable when you're matched up against completely uneven odds... I'd say 5/10 if they improve the match making (which I seriously doubt since it hasn't changed for the past 5 years) I refuse to rate it any higher
3169	0	a	Really i like most games and this seemed fun. *from the moment your in ur pitted agest anything from rank 5 to rank 100. *most players are to overpowerd at lower stages of the game. *tbh it's again pay to win *if you take the job and some little 5 year old boy wants to do even thou he/she is in ur team they will team kill you *most just do nothing let 1 person do all and then bich when they lose all over no thanks id rather go through frachuring my arm again then try play this any longer
3170	0	a	Steer clear from this game. It is Pay to win.
3171	0	a	Calling this a GTA clone is an insult to GTA. Calling it crap is a slap in the face of feces. This is just a terrible, terrible game with ps2 era graphics and gameplay.
3172	0	a	It's GTA + aimbots
3173	0	a	Hacks and hacks and aimbots and punk buster hacks and more hacking and people who jump while aiming in air and kill you hacks all day everyday if you want to waste money on market place and get hacked with new best gear play APB reloaded and get hacked all day.
3174	0	a	I love this game, jk lmao it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing garbo m80. Enjoy getting killed by try harding â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that pride themselves on killing level one's. lagging servers and sliding butter cars, make this game a must have for the poor orphans at Christmas  1337/10 My nan loved it.
3175	0	a	This game is an MMO. If that doesn't tell you what you should expect, probably stay away. If you like dying over and over again, this might be the game for you. I don't, which is why I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Frankly, this is not a review of the game so much as it is of the genre and the community. If you're the kind of person who can keep interest in this sort of thing long enough to get good, my review should mean nothing to you.  As for the rest? The people like me who joined too late/couldn't get the hang of it, and were thus deprived of all the fun this game had to offer? Well, if you're like me, you got interested in this based on style, color, and rampant, light-hearted brutality. You can find all that, plus a single-player or co-op environment that wants you to experience it, in the Saint's Row series. Saint's Row the Third and Saint's Row IV in particular are the closest to what I wanted out of APB. And go ahead and get the full package for the games as well, if you can. Having a tank right out of the tutorial sequence was EXTREMELY helpful and fun in 3.
3176	0	a	The Pay2Win level of this game is just........ It can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirs. I honestly tried to get to the max level....... But every time they updated the level cap would just increase, and the fact that you  rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the Premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on end. I eventually stopped at rank 100+ The max rank is probably 235+ by now. The game's matchmaking system is purely unbalanced. If you're a bronze threat player.... You basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies, and also.... The backup that you get usually doesn't match the power that the opposition has, unless of course you roll with a clan that's filled with 150+ ranked silvers and goldies. But then again, there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this, it's just a bit sad that the community is just.........  But still, I would recommend it with friends, and also don't take this game too seriously
3177	0	a	APB Reloaded, a game where you join bronze districts to mainly end up fighting silver and golds, join silver districts to mainly fight golds and gold districts to end up fighting no one. Also the matchmaking, its broken, I ended up fighting two golds who had r255 (rounds I assume) and I had r33, my team consisted of me and two other bronze players who were also on r33, so it was us three bronze players who were using the starter weps vs two golds who were using high level guns with three modifications on them and they were also using player modifications, I'd tell you who won but you should be able to guess.....At the core this is a good game, the mechanics are fun and enjoyable but with this matchmaking the game is just unplayable. For your own benefit don't play this game unless you play with friends or until they have fixed the matchmaking.
3178	0	a	Some good things about the game :  - Best character creator I've ever seen  - Nice take on cops and robbers  - Great ways to customize clothing and vehicles  - You can create your own music  - Wide range of weapons and clothes  - Gameplay is fun for a while  - 2 reasonably big maps to play on  - Great leveling system  *Instead of actual levels, you level up contracts, that will reward you with new vehicles, clothing, weapons, customization options, and new contacts to level up.    Some bad things about the game :  -The game has a P2W (Pay-to-Win) feel to it  *Great weapons cost real money and are very overpowered compared to the in-game weapons  - F2P weapons are very similar  *Several of the same weapon, with different buffs  - FPS isn't very smooth unless you have a good PC  - Driving is a bit slow, reactions are off  *Turning has a very slight delay after pressing the key  - Absolutely terrible ranking system  *The game's 'Threat Level' is basically a ranking to show off your skill in matches.  *The game has districts dedicated for each rank (Gold, silver bronze) but players of that rank aren't forced to join one of those servers, resulting in a high amount of golds in silver districts (Very little, if any, silvers), and many golds/silvers in bronze districts (Few bronzes). This makes it hard for bronzes and silvers to level up.   The game is fun overall but being P2W ruins it for me. I don't know if many others have had a similar issue, but whenever the game is installed to my pc, it slows down my performance overall, but goes away once uninstalled. The game's worth trying out, but don't expect for it to be the greatest thing ever.
3179	0	a	still not better than gta I  this game is crap / this game is crap
3180	0	a	It's mostly pay to win. Sure it may be free but it is absolutely terrible.
3181	0	a	Its a pay to win game!!  Was fun at first before they got greedy and now only cheaters and people with credit cards play. AVOID THIS GAME!!
3182	0	a	It won't let me close the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gamw !
3183	0	a	This game is a ripoff of and its not even fun, dont get this game if you want a game like GTA, just get GTA instead of this crap
3184	0	a	dont even bother, the devs are milking this game for every micro transaction its worth and then some.
3185	0	a	This game helped me learn that being cooperative and working together is the key to success.  Unfortunately, none of this happens. You either get called a noob, hacker, or just get frustrated.... Because in the end, all you will hear is the sound of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ quality music playing through your teammates mic.   The only reason you should play this game is if you have friends that will play with you. This game is nothing without cooperation.   For these reasons I do not recommend this game.
3186	0	a	Its a fun game and all until.......... -Massive pay to win game -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ customor service -money hungry -â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community aghhh you get the point, its another pay to win game  My story  After playing over 150 hours ( on my other account ) i was in a match and i got a 20 kill streak, dammm i was on fire until these group of 12 year olds complained and reported me for hacking...l got banned!  Support was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, all they did was send me a auto message that had nothing to do with my problem  DONT GET THIS UNLESS YOUR 12 AND CAN USE YOUR MUMS CARDS TO PAY TO WIN
3187	0	a	Pay to win crap...ad that is all i have to say. Pay to Win or pay to do anthing really..cant customize anything unless you shell out cash
3188	0	a	Rank 53 without knowledge against Rank 198. Mission Matchmaking System 11/10. Even Tetris is more fun.
3189	0	a	10/10 would uninstall again
3190	0	a	This game is a pay to win ClusterFork.  It's not enjoyable, and in no means can I recommend it to you and feel good about doing so.  In my opinion, I'd say avoid this game, it's not worth the time.
3191	0	a	Dead on GTA 5's arrival.
3192	0	a	bought a car in cash 20euro....the second day 40%sell......don't buy anything!
3193	0	a	This game is poopoo
3194	0	a	Pay 2 win. Dont even play it. Its not 'Free To Play'  Not willing to spend? Dont install
3195	0	a	Would you stick your tongue as deep as you could possibly reach inside the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a woman who has been used as the city's sperm dumpster? If you answered 'Yes', then by all means, play this game.
3196	0	a	THIS GAME SUCK LAGGY AS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ HOLE PLAYERS O/10
3197	0	a	For me, I was really excited about this game when I first saw it. It looked like a fun cops and robbers kind of game. When I got in, I realized that there was a good amount of customization available, which is always nice. I even set up some playlists to blast in my car. However, that's about as good as it will get. The gameplay is somewhat odd because everything feels kind of bland. There isn't too much to do in the world unless you are playing with friends. There are some missions that just feel really weird too. I didn't enjoy the controls much either. The community is alright, I guess. It's just not much that is offered in this game, but I guess that's kind of a regular thing for free-to-play games.
3198	0	a	Sucks, lag is bad. used to 'like' the game but now anymore
3199	0	a	This game flat out dosent work.
3200	0	a	The best part about this game is uninstalling it. &lt;3
3201	0	a	Hold it! Stop right there, No gamers beyond this point! !!!!!!!!  No use playing: High ranking players stalk the low level distracts and will keep you from getting any actual experience. In short - you're screwed if you're not cheating.  Did I mention it takes a half an hour to load?
3202	0	a	this game isnt that good i mean i went on to the enforcer side and people were talking about being horny and being nude in skype calls
3203	0	a	Wasting my time in loading screens....
3204	0	a	No, just No. Dont don't do it. Hell No.  Games going nowhere fast.  New pay2win gun every other to few months.  Only play fight club. Rest of the game is a repetitive driving item pickup simulator.
3205	0	a	this game is full of hackers and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.
3206	0	a	cant run it so i got a new laptop for this game. still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on my heart with crappyness (update) i had some fun then realized irs â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and dedownloaded it  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥/7
3207	0	a	If you can't play GTA then play this.  If you can play GTA then play GTA instead.
3208	0	a	Don't touch this game unless you have friends (AND U GUYS PRBLY DONT LOL). It's completely and utterly garbage without it. No but seriously, this game is an utter mess, it's good fun with your friends but otherwise you deal with a toxic community, a questionable company and so many hackers that the braindead community can't distinguish between the real ones and players that just play a lot.
3209	0	a	APB Reloaded, what can I say. The game is pretty fun and there are alot of options with cars, guns and clothing but it becomes a little bit pay to win. I have 220+ hours on this game and that tells that I have played this game long enough to give my opinion. It is fun with a group of friends, but if you ar going to play it solo it will get boring (if you play it with friends it will also get boring) So sadly I dont reccomend this game even though this game KICKED â™¥â™¥â™¥ back in 2011 when it became free to play (it wasnt free to play before 2011 you had to buy it as a disk and install the game with that) When u bought that u would get some G1C and a free gun for lifetime and some more things.  Theres nothing wrong with the game itself though but it became pay2win which is dissapointing.  Conclusion:  If you have some money to spend and some friends that can also spend some money (about 100$ for the tommygun) thats not the best weapon though but just and example then I would recommend this game, if not search for something else.  IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON PLAYING IT HERE ARE SOME REDEEM CODES: :D (DONT COMPLAIN IF THEY ARE EXPIRED I CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT)  Premium: FUN4ADAY - 1 day premium VYEJ-LWWZ-3R35-G575 - 3 Days Premium NG40WR4Q2K9M5CSL - 1 Day Premium WELCOMETOSANPARO - 1 Day Premium FairFight - 5 Days Premium + 50 G1C  Clothing: PH4TB3ATZ - Headphones INCOGN1TO - Domino Mask  Weapons: R1FLE4ADAY - CR5 1 day lease 1DAYGOLDEN44 - ACT 44 gold plated, 1 day. 9RBPQN9QHP8QSCN6 - 10 day premium &amp; 10 day kraken  Other: UWOTM8 - Taunt Emote HAZARDOUS - 4 colour skins for the Hazardous TommyGun 1WUZH3R3 - Tag Font set
3210	0	a	Pay to Win -.-
3211	0	a	It needs offline for people with no friends
3212	0	a	As of now i cant even spawn i try over and over and i can't spawn and until they fix this i would not recomend unless you would like to sit through 5 minutes of loading screens for the game to crash.
3213	0	a	pay to win trash
3214	0	a	Crashed in the first five seconds. 10/10
3215	0	a	The customization is awesome! The match making is terrible. I really really wanted to play this. I LOVE THE CUSTOMIZATION! I just can't take getting brutally murdered on every single mission and people telling me how all silvers need to go kill themselves. Playing vs other bronze players the game is fun. You are both new your weapons kind of suck and it's ok. The second you hit silver you will be massacred again and again and expect both your team mates and the other team (they can whisper you to tell you exactly what kind of an a*#hole you are and how your getting 'rekt!nub silver die!*) to berate you constantly. This makes starting out not only frustrating, but no fun at all. I don't want to be a pretty piece of cannon fodder for P2winners, hackers, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bags. It's kind of funny that the game's anti cheat thinger is called fair fight when nothing past bronze is even sort of fair. Do I want to spend the time watching myself die over and over again so that maybe I can unlock things that will even the score for a game that might (and probably should) die soon? No thanks. Also the hit detection is godawful. If you think shooting someone in the head should count for as many points as shooting them in the foot? You should ignore my review and play apb.
3216	0	a	This is the absolute WORST FPS I've ever played.... you're reading the introductory text (ie., you don't even know the movement keys yet) and get slaughtered in the spawn area by some APB Troll.... then he thinks he's so funny that he does it another 20 times.  If I paid for this game, I'd be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. As it is, I'll simply uninstall it and go back to Combat Arms.
3217	0	a	the game won't launch despite i already update my Nvidia PhysX to the latest version

3223	0	a	I do not reccomend anyone to waste his time by playing this game. It's poorly made and very inbalanced. The match-making system is terribly broken. You'll often find yourself, a low lvl 5 guy against lvl 200 players. It's very frustrating, progress is very slow and unrewarding. The game is very poorly made and optimized, the physics engine is terrible, steering lags a whole 3-4 seconds making car driving close to imposible. The game is full of trolls and rammers and the overall atmosphere of this game is of hate. The most commonly typed sentence in this game is 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ y0u N00B di3 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!' Many players were banned for no reason because of an upsurge of cheaters and with every patch the game just keeps getting worse, the only additions being new stuff to rob money from you with. I DO NOT Reccomend this garbage to anyone.
3224	0	a	this game is like no other game thats i have ever seen befor this game has so many hackers so many glitches and so much profanity its a shame to call that a video game i was very interested in the game and was very very up set i couldnt progress because its such a mess in that game and i hope any parent that sees this game does not buy it for there child this game need to be banned. this is y people are being bullied and pushed around this game is garbage.   p.s. SUCH A SHAME
3225	0	a	This game kicked me from the server every time I joined one. I loved the look of this game but it won't even let me play it.
3226	0	a	Rather play GTA online. At least GTA online not PAY to WIN.
3227	0	a	who the hell would buy a 100$ dlc for this game
3228	0	a	I can't even get in the game 
3229	0	a	This game is like gta 3 on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ steroids handles horrible, tutorial is harder than the final Mario boss battle, and the driving engine f*****g sucks this game is sooooo not worth your computer's disk space.
3230	0	a	everytime i logg in to the game play for 2 miutes i get kicked off how can you play a game when they spend more time loading and unloading then play time
3231	0	a	This game sucks don't play it it will make you cry and the developers spit in your eye DAMN you Gamers First DAMN you.
3232	0	a	Now, this game is really fun and has lots of stuff packed into the game and I can clearly see lots of work has been put into this game. However,   Pros: -Very costumizable cars -Lots of clothes and accessories -Really fun missions -Very fun gameplay  Cons: -Horrible lag -Missions are very repetitive and have little variety   Other than that, this game is really fun.  8/10 would lag again.
3233	0	a	I do not recommend this game 100%. It is 'Pay to Win' meaning you have to pay real money for the best gear or you will never win like you should be. And even when you do buy something, it gives you a 30 day time period then you have to buy it again. It is infested with hackers which really downgrades the quality of the gameplay, I would just wait for the game to come out on Console 'Xbox One &amp; PS4' which is scedualed to hit the consoles in August of this year but we are still waiting word from game devs.  In conclusion, I recommend this game about 45%  This is not how a MMO should be.
3234	0	a	You know the idea of this is great and all, but the fact that it is a pay-to-win game is still completely real. Would I ever play this again? No, but if the devs of this decided to make a singleplayer campange(cant spell) of this game with optional co-op I would love this game but until then I will stay back and watch what happens. Do I recommend this game? No, but if you have lots of money to burn on a game go ahead. Even though i have a low playtime, I am aware of this pay-to-win stature because of when i went to customixe the starter vehicle, it said 'You have too many stickers(lol wut i forgot what they were),please delete some before finishing.' The. Car. Started. Above. The. Non. Premium. Limit. I Was like UH NO THX ILL PASS. I basicly turned a great new ar bak to its original state cause PREMIUM HAVE INFINITE STICKERS BUT I DNT.
3235	0	a	Game given to us from the heavens includes: The game not working correctly Bugs Runs in background AND MANY MORE Game Of The Year 2015 11/10 Would Uninstall Again!
3236	0	a	The game michanics could be tweeked and the graphics could be better but it seems like a big pay to win.
3237	0	a	i could not conferm my email address due to the fact that the site was unavailable.
3238	0	a	Pretty difficult to get a formidiable gun without paying money.
3239	0	a	waste of time simulator 10/10 would uninstall again
3240	0	a	warning game is not good at all
3241	0	a	its not as fun as they make it out to be
3242	0	a	Nope. This game has absolute potential, but new players are vulnerable to hackers and higher ranks with overpowered weapons. Don't waste your time installing this game, unless you want to get blown up by a pornstar with an RPG and rage over it. The only good thing about APB: Reloaded is the character customization. Not friendly to newcomers, you have to pay2win. Uninstalled immediately.
3243	0	a	this game is straight up meth. hooks you in to the game. yet the game itself isn't good in anyway.   if your enemy has a better gun, your dead. how to win fights with equals, jump,crouch, act like a madman with a gun.  oh you want to know about the cars? well you can literally blow up a car by running into it with yours if it's fast enough. unavoidable death to teh opposing side. you can't shoot trough windows. takes forever to blow up teh car (unless you got a real money bought weapon) , which the driver gets a notification 10 full seconds before. unless ofcourse you got a rocket launcher. which insta kills anything, you can't really miss. and if you don't have a payed for gun. don't even think about shooting at a guy with a launcher. he will turn around and set you flying off better than north koreas rocket program.  oh you want guns? well you either buy it again every 10 days or you pay real money for it. even up to 40$. not even kidding.  only the basic concept of the game is good. but the game is literally designed to minimize skill out of the game. thus having better guns be an absolute grindfiest to get. or you pay for it. in real money.  only 2 good things, the character creation is actually quite good, but since it allows you to change your height, there is absolutetly no headshot dmg multiplier of sorts. hit him anywhere adn the same dmg is applie.  and for the otehr ofcourse the uninstall process. this game is horrible.
3244	0	a	Takes ages to set up, and once your in its very boring. even with your friends. 
3245	0	a	Metascore 1.3/100  1 point is for it's free, 0.3 point is for potato.
3246	0	a	Tried jumping back into the game but got error after error after error trying to log in and play.  Don't know what you guys are doing but something this buggy should not be present in a 3-4 (?) year old game.
3247	0	a	This game is absolute disaster, it had multiple years to fix it. But it did squat but make p2w weaponry. This game is not worth it, PRERIOD.
3248	0	a	Totall pay to win game, but still fun in a dumb way. 3/10 ign.
3249	0	a	Horrible game and company dont waste your money...both me and a friend got banned for absolutely no reason...we hadnt even PLAYED the game in over a year, suddenly we get on and their fairfight system bans us the second we log off? thats cool.  I spent like 3-400$ on this game, never playing their games again.  Email them try to follow up, and they basically say 'that sucks'  Started playing the game(looking over emails here), on 11/2/2012, never made it out of silver, never got any crazy stats with any of my weapons, i was better with some that others obviously but eh.  Then after almost 2 years of completely ON AND OFF play(mainly BECAUSE of hackers running around in the game), my friend gets on tells me about the fairfight system, and how he has not seen any hackers since, i get excited i hop on, play literally 1 mission log off and boom.

3250	0	a	To be honest, if you wanna enjoy this game be prepared to spend at least 300 dollars more on it. The average is 1500 dollars.  Enjoy your pay to win free to play game.
3251	0	a	This game is full of ****. They rip you off of all of the money that you pore into this game. I spent some money on it and I never got my G1 credits.
3252	0	a	It was once a good game, now broken by bad devolopers, bad matchmaking, and greedy developers.
3253	0	a	First impression bit sloppy Guide Player Base Seems like League of Legends Kids start screaming and flaming the moment it aint going in their favor and come up with petty insults overal the game's garbage
3254	0	a	this game does not run its a ripoff
3255	0	a	It is a pain to download!
3256	0	a	Ok... APB Reloaded is a peculiar game. It's fun and completely awful all at the same time. The most controversial aspect of this game is it's usage of the Free-to-play model, a significant change from it's original incarnation as a subscription based game. However, this model always begs the question: Do you actually have to pay money to play this game against other paying players? In this case, the answer is unfortunately a resounding 'Yes!!!' Using in-game money received from beating missions (which I have significant issues, as you'll read momentarily) only unlocks weapons for 10 days. Additionally, not all weapon types are available for purchase using the in-game money. Some of the most powerful weapons in the game (the OCA 'Whisper,' for example) are only available for purchase using G1 credits -- otherwise known as real money. This type of F2P model is horribly unattractive to me. If you offer a game for free, don't restrict the fun to the people that play.
3257	0	a	I managed to get a few hours playing this game, and what I found out to my content, was very sad. This game was very fun in the beggining, it had nice graphics, the game play was fun, and I thought it was going to be a very fun and good game. A few more hours of gaming and I learned that the only way to actually get anything is with real money, THIS IS A PAY-TO-WIN GAME, what pay-to-win generally means is that the only way to get stuff or be good in the game is to buy stuff with real money. After I kept playing I saw that the community was complete trash, too. As well as the greedy producers of this game. I do not recommend this game for any reason, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money playing the game and googling things because no one is opt to help you.
3258	0	a	Doesn't even launch. Waste of space.
3259	0	a	amazing character creation but the game is ughghgh
3260	0	a	This game is ludicrously frustrating, but I can't stop playing it.
3261	0	a	There is no learning curve, there is a level curve. The match making is non existent so you will constantly get people who are miles ahead of you equipment. The only way to catch up is lose enough missions to level up maybe after a month you can finally catch up and play with the good equipment. Highly recommend playing with freinds and not alone.
3262	0	a	If you like waiting extreme periods of time just to play a low graphics game, this is the game for you! When you first log in, you get to what I call the 'black box of death'. (And that after all the 10 other loading screens). Then you'll sit through 24 more loading screens and eventally wait 12 hours to get in a server, only to find that everyone is a total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that only kills you.
3263	0	a	I would recommend this game, but I can't connect to a server, tried all of them but wouldn't, gave it like a week just to try it out, but it still doesn't work
3264	0	a	Solid concept, bad execution. Why? Online multiplayer doesn't work. &gt;.&gt;
3265	0	a	Im checking how many hours i have because i don't want to reinstall. I don't know who would want to, with a game as P2W as this
3266	0	a	Just another P2W game...
3267	0	a	-10/10 wouldnt even uninstall again
3268	0	a	So i hit play and all it does is takes me to their facebook page saying like me. HOW STUPID!
3269	0	a	I Play this for may Hours. Many Many hours through there opener not steam and well it got worse as i played i loved this game Sunk hours of my life in to it but in the end Quit from disappointment the game population has dissappered as well.  I could go well in to depth about why im dissapointed but it would be very very long
3270	0	a	It is almost impossible to kill someone with the first level guns, It takes 30 hits from the 1st rifle in the game to kill someone. Then you get blown away with shotguns and more powerful weapons. This is a pay to win game. I played for a day, and it was mostly dying.....
3271	0	a	Not going to get into the problems, but this is a very flawed gem if you like these types of games. MY GRIPE Is it doesn't seem to be workig since I upgraded and got a new rig with a GTX 960. It appears others have issues with this and there maybe compatability issues with this GPU and APB that should be fixed
3272	0	a	This whole playtime it was just me trying to open the game and log in. Created two accounts and it would still not let me log in, I stated my real age which is 18 but apperantly I'm too young to play the game. The game does not close nor open normally and you cannot alt+tab while in any part of the game. The in-game logos at the start are un-skipable and it's just completely a mess...
3273	0	a	No gametime, it installed several things into chrome and even more dissapointing, it doesn't launch!   0/10 Everyone On The Internets
3274	0	a	Game doesnt load for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3275	0	a	This Game Eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. He dosent let me login.
3276	0	a	Hackers, hackers oh and more hackers 11/10 would play this hacker simulator again.
3277	0	a	This game is nothing short of terrible. Was fun initially, then just went to hell VERY fast. Sad thing is this game had potential, but also has developers that suck.
3278	0	a	Not alot to do, being the cop has less things to do than the criminal but the criminal still has hardly anything. it gets repetitive its just take deliver take deliver, you can shop but thats about it erm...the events are the same mug some people kill some boss and deliver what you stole from the person you mugged.theres mailboxes to recive things but it's not that good theres chop shops and tiny missions that are all the same.  overall rating:4/10 it's okay to play every know and then but only for like 5-10 mins because it's repetetive and boring just like my complaint!!  
3279	0	a	This game is broken, very little actual gameplay mostly just go from A to b to C and fight people with no clear objective. Cars feel like they are on ice. to get any acutal upgrades u need to pay. Most players cheat or are useing hacks. stay very far away from this game. 0/10
3280	0	a	This game USED to be truly great. But due to severe mismanagement of the original developer company. They went bankrupt which meant the Game got taken down. About a Year or so later Gamers First aquired the game.  Everyone was excited and happy the game was comming back. What followed as the DEV Blogs started comming out was a step by step description of how Gamers First was taking an axe to the original game.  They ruined several of the key aspects of the game. Most notable the Editors. But gameplay suffered greeatly aswell. My freinds and I had spent several hundreds of hours in the original. And every now and then we will give the gamers first version a go. But the game is now just a shadow of what it once was.  Dont waste your time with this...Thats the best advise I can give you.
3281	0	a	San Paro...A city in peril with its streets overrun with gang violence, all at the feet of the Evil Corporation, 'Gamersfirst'. Will you escape the clutches of poverty and take what isn't yours? Or will you be the few and proud to standup to this chaos? Are you ready to take the fight to the streets? Well don't, stay at home and dont spend any money on this game, all it does is make the Jews at Gamersfirst more powerful....
3282	0	a	The game is VERY cool and funny, BUT it have 2 things that totally SUCKS:  -The matchking, u may play against players with LOTS of reputation ( levels ) more than you, i was 59 and i was matched against people with R 149, 229, etc, SUCKS!  -The weapons store, i have just 4 days playing and i have to play against people with more experience AND premium weapons, that means perfect damage, aiming, lots of bullets, etc, and they earn double exp and money than normal people, i understand its common you can buy premium isues BUT the difference between premium and normal is too high, the premium moddified weapons are so stupidly overpowered .   So, if you have money to buy premium stuff, welcome! enjoy it! but if you dont, dont even try this game, because ur only going to lose.
3283	0	a	SOOOOO much wasted potential. This game could have been what GTA online should have been, but too many flaws are holding it back.  The gameplay is very, very fun. Missions have you either breaking into buildings, hijacking cars, or hacking satellites if you are a criminal, or preventing criminals from doing so and arresting people if you are a dirty copper. While most of the time the missions are actually balanced and require strategic plays and superior aiming from both teams, there are plenty of times where mission objectives can be exploited by parking a car on top of the objective and shooting it til it explodes, rendering the mission impossible to complete. Not fair or fun. It is also very likely as a bronze rank you will get stuck against gold ranks with pay2win 1shotkill guns.  Also hackers. So. Many. Hackers. If you somehow manage to make it to gold rank, you will never be in another mission without an aimbotter. You won't. Ever.  Customization is amazing. Everything is customizeable from your character to the car they drive to the song the enemy hears when they kill you. But hackers. Always hackers everywhere aimbots hacks hacking hackers hacked bot botter aimot botting aimbotting hacks
3284	0	a	I played this game  something that I Don't like it at all is Ping of the Servers it's too high and I've got so many lags 1.5 sec Dlay in Commands not good! I couldn't play any more
3285	0	a	first of all i had to do a 5hour update which isi just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t second i had to download the game 2 times and it didnt even launch so dont get this game unless u want to spen 9 hours waiting 
3286	0	a	this is a good game  but have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad engine
3287	0	a	The game seemed promising enough at first but when I got in a car I noticed the most peculiar of happenings. The driving lagged...a lot. like when I tried to turn left, it wouldn't turn for like a second or so after I pressed the button, leading to some frustrating driving. This one seemingly insignificant drawback successfully ruined the game for me.   Final Verdict: 2/10
3288	0	a	Never spend money on a free game. If you download this, you'll either have to buy your gear or spend hundreds of hours trying to keep up with the frequent spenders.  This game is realy just fun for the moment, not a long term game.
3289	0	a	I cant eaven start the game with these all errors game 0/11 go nahui game
3290	0	a	can't get past launcher. not worth the time.
3291	0	a	Terrible game pay2win
3292	0	a	Hello Guys, I've played this game for years starting in 2010 with some friends and I have played around 2000+ hrs on my account and 60 something hours via steam, But the reason I'm writing this review is to give advice to the next Innocent person walking into this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hole of game. Firstly the game is a love hate relationship you either like it or hate it not to mention also customization is brilliant but here comes the negative aspects.  Apb is a free to play mmo cops and robbers themed game, With free to plays you expect microtransactions well there is but the problem is they milk people for money, without considering what people actually want. For example people want the engine update or fix's for annoying bugs, but instead of good updates which make people more happy they slap a armas gun on the market place claiming it to be something magnificent, but it is only a reskin of another weapon in game.   Another reason why this game is bad is because of it's own community, the people in the community are absolutely cancerous and only strive to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you off or make your day worse, Not saying everyone is cancerous because I've have spoke to quite a few nice people it's just the majority. Not to mention there are quite a few unbalanced weapons, like before I used to think 'Well that guy is Just better than me' Which in most cases it was; but if you put a unbalanced weapon in the hands of a good player or even a bad one they can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your entire match up.   After all of that Negative â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I'll come down to saying this I'm giving a Warning to all players or people thinking of Playing this game. This game can cause you stress like nothing else and if you have anything like epilepsy or some sort PTSD stay away because it will cause you so much stress and make you soo â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that you're either going to have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing seizure or just freak the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out. Last thing I will say just to give you another reason to not play is gamersfirst make tons of promises which never happen.  Out of 1-10 It's a 4/10  Thus that makes the end of my Extremely Negative review and if any of you are interested I'm selling 4 of legendarys on Jericho (NA) add Ryoukomatoii and PM me or leave a message in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ review. Legendaries, Grenade launcher which shoots Concs, Nano, Ntec 7 Ursus and Hitchhiker I believe. I'll take real money these Will be going at a cheap price
3293	0	a	It is an ok game but it kind of runs slow on my pc . Also its not that fun to play to me.
3294	0	a	The game was free to play then it was pay to win now its who pays more he wins so dont play this game if you dont have money :D
3295	0	a	To much error's.
3296	0	a	THE GAME SUCK YOU CANT LOGIN IN AND STEAM
3297	0	a	Really, it isn't too much fun. You can't really change the look of your character, mission can be hard, everyone is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If you're looking for an F2P GTA, this isn't what you came for. If you came for a TPS with some decently good graphics, hop onboard.
3298	0	a	While the game has a great idea behind it, still one of the best around when it comes to character customization possibilities and has nicely flowing combat (if your pc can handle it), sadly the game is riddled with faults. Declining population, constantly rerolling cheaters who just can create new account as soon as previois one gets banned (which takes ungodly amount of time for them to do despite having 2 anti-cheat systems running), bad netcode causing loads of desync issues, servers failing to run at intended tickrate, etc...  That being said, if you're still interested to see it yourself after these warnings, why not give it a go? Just expect total misery and the game may happily suprise you (bet it won't in most cases though).
3299	0	a	This is an ANTI-recommend. A game that keeps crashing on the character creator is a game that's hardly worth it. Considering its troubled history back from when it was a pay game, it's not worth it as free, either.
3300	0	a	One of the worst games you ll ever play. Its a pay2win game. Even though it tries not be it just cant. Its also one of the worst shooting games i ve ever played, because when you are in combat jumping around and running around will help you avoid bullets as well shooting while zig zaging around the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ place kill the oppoment. Snipers are not snipers, meaning that they dont even have a scope. its all 3rd person everybody! FU SNIPERS! Also the fact with cops vs criminals is one of the broken pieces of the game. 80 people max in a server. Every other server is empty. Did i forget to tell you that you rent guns? no? well you rend guns, cars , and lots of things that makes you baddass in this game for the max days of 10(atleast for guns i know of). I would rate the game 20/100 just because at first i had fun killing my other m8s because they killed me while investigating. I would recommend not getting involved with this game. Waste of time. IGN 10/10
3301	0	a	This game is very unique and has a truckload of potential. I've played on and off for a couple years now (although only a couple hours through steam) and this is what I have to say: Pros: -Unique (more or less) Concept -High Potential -Graphics are pretty good -Decent amount of features for both sides (criminal and enforcer) -Some of the best and most in depth character customization I've seen (rivals the sims [almost]) Cons: -Published by Gamers First -Laggy -Graphics while pleasing are buggy -AI is buggy -Takes pay to win to a whole new level -No plot at all -No matchmaking at all -Other players can be a nuisance at times -Steep learning curve
3302	0	a	After playing this game for 1 year, I can honestly say that I am sick of it. In the beginning, I really enjoyed the game, simply for the fact that it was basically an online version of GTA (open world, stealing pedestrian cars, shooting, third person, etc). The customization in the game was what also kept me drawn to it (also because it is a third person shooter). The amount of detail you can put on your character was like no other F2P game that I have played. Plus you have the ability to create unique custom symbols, themes, songs and car designs. The gameplay is also pretty good. The missions are standard (pick up items, guard items, capture and hold the base/item). It's kinda cool how even though you are in a mission, you are still in the open world and still able to interact with others outside the game (like you don't have to go in a game room and have private matches). But it also gets annoying to deal with grievers and having players run into each other.   Of course with any PVP game, you will have players who are more skilled in the game than others. That's the reason for the player threat level (Bronze, Silver and Gold). There are districts for each of these levels, but of course players choose to play in the lowest district threat as they could (Gold players in Silver district and Silver players in Bronze district). I'm not complaining though because I am just as guilty of this (we all like to feel pro ^^). The weapons in the game however can be unbalanced. Those who choose to purchase G1C have the fortune of obtaining the latest (and most garbage looking reskins remade with some percs) weapons. But that's nothing new. Every game has it's share of P2W.  What I hated most about this game was the community. I haven't played much online games in general, but with the few that I have, it does not compare to the level of displeasure as APB.Of course with any online game, you get your share of trolls, douches and jerks; but this game somewhat gives the advantage to these people (for example: following you around with a car to grieve you, ghost your missions, or sit on top of mission items to purposely make you lose a mission). Not to mention if you are having some luck on a day and do exceptionally well in your matches, you are then insulted and accused of hacking. In opposition to that, if you do poorly you are also ridiculed for playing as an amateur and labelled as a 'noob' or 'scrub'. So no matter how good or bad you are at this game, you will face some form of harassment.  So like I said, I have developed an extreme dislike for this game. Or maybe I've been playing it for too long and finally become sick of it. It's still a fun game, even if it has it's MAJOR flaws.
3303	0	a	It's hard to call that playing as it kept shutting down. Buggy.
3304	0	a	Its bad 0/10
3305	0	a	Probably favorite game of all time but since I have posted a dozen times on forums on Steam, Gamersfirst and APB website, and have gotten little to no help with figuring out a bug that wont launch the game. I am not recommending. Very salty.
3306	0	a	Three words, pay to win. If it was a non f2p MABY it would be good. 'team game' BULL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ nothing about this game is team oriented, whether its the server lag â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing over every one or if it is players being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I cannot say but either way its not wortha any investment time or otherwise. -7581/10
3307	0	a	i lunched iy 5 times and it did not lucnh and then i cant delete it so i dont like the game 
3308	0	a	laggy servers, tons of hackers, shtt devs, 3rd person shooter tactics are aids
3309	0	a	Gets boring after a while... You have to work for a quite a long time to achive what you wanna have. The only thing I like is that you can really put a lot into making your characters. Kinda like The Sims 4 at that point, but poorer.
3310	0	a	You will encounter pro players if you are new in game, those players have plenty of premium and P2W weapons you dont stand a chance and thats why this game is dying all new players, are rage quitting because of that, the devs dont care about it because all the Golds are paying in $ Gold/premium hackers are not getting banned, they get supported by game masters.  roughly 54% of the players are hackers, 30% are Pro players and clans and all the rest are randoms and noobs.   gold players play on silver servers to pwn the regular players, the silvers are mad and play on bronze servers because they are tired of getting owned by golds and the bronze players and trainee players are getting pwnd by both and thats why they are leaving this unfair game, you shoud NOT download this game until they fix it or you will have a very frustrating/painful and hard start into this game, which means you are forced to go this way because they will NEVER fix this issue.
3311	0	a	the game says p2w guns aren't more powerful then f2p guns (well lets see) p2w side one shot dead half a map away dead cars driving at 900 mph dead f2p side stand at somone shooting them multiple times he has same weapon we empty our clips me barley killing him car drives at 2 mph car blows up from two crashes then im ran over then one shot by a pay to winner have tactical adventage shot him 4 times he turns around casuly killing me  yea defintly f2p here guys 0/10
3312	0	a	This game leans on, advertise's, and preys on those who get dragged in to character building. A bunch of Youtube trolls covincing me a broke â™¥â™¥â™¥ game has potential because they were paid to promote the character creation 'the only unbroken part of the game.'   Yet still, you have to pay to unlock a crap ton of designs... unless your spend hard earned hours to get some decent items at the bottom of their list.   Free to play or pay to win... That's the name of this game.   To top it off, there are major glitches in the game that won't allow your gameplay to be satisfying or many times enjoyable at all. Why waste a minute to 100 hours of game play guaranteed not to work properly 70% of the time? My final straw at my final hour of game play, was not getting any credit for one of my best battles in the game. That doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you are trying to earn in game money so you don't have to dish out 100 dollars for items, it really will tick you off.  After this review, you can consider downloading it and find out for yourself... GTA 5 is out, so not really a point in investing on a lesser copycat of the GTA legacy.  Over all, this is my official rating for APB Reloaded:  ....................../Â´Â¯/) ....................,/Â¯../ .................../..../ ............./Â´Â¯/'...'/Â´Â¯Â¯`Â·Â¸ ........../'/.../..../......./Â¨Â¯\ ........('(...Â´...Â´....

3318	0	a	Not the best game mainly because I can't join a server! The game doesn't even let me exit it whilst it's trying to join a server! (alt + tab doesn't even work)

3320	0	a	whats physx? 
3321	0	a	This game is incredebly glitchy and has issues around every corner. The game gives you misions to complete and once you have done so it just continues telling you to do it. When I first started it was ok but for the past 3 days I have been getting major game glitches and have not been able to succeed in doing anything the game wants me to because of it. The game also has severe network issues and is continuesly losing connection to servers even though my internet is just fine, quite annoying.
3322	0	a	[OLD REVIEW, SEE NEW BELOW THIS Recommended Meh. 6/10. It's not that great of a game. There's constant lag no matter which server you choose to spawn in, and that interferes with some cool sound effects that would be greata otherwise (car engine, car radio, etcetera). The gameplay itself is great, but really, REALLY pay to win. You can't even get a permanent weapon without paying, but that doesn't matter much, because these weapons are cheap, and you DO get one permanent weapon in some early days of playing. The co-op open world sandbox is great. I love driving around competing against other groups with a group of friends while driving around in an ambulance or feeling the pressure when I do the drug mule event when other players hunt me down. Lag interferes a lot with pvp though, just a heads up. [NEW REVIEW, 12/22/15] Oh God... 2/10. It's a terrible game. Do not come to this game looking for a game with the freedom and open worldness of Grand Theft Auto V, for thou shall not find it. Do not come to this game looking for the humor that surrounds Saints Row 4. For thou shall not find it. Do not come here looking for the sandbox flexiblity of Garry's Mod, for thou shall not find it. Do not come here looking for the combat mechanics of Call of Duty, Counter Strike, or any other good shooter games, for thou shall not find them here. Do not come to this game seeking the great community of Reddit, for thou shall not find it here. Do not come to this game with high hopes, for thy hopes will be brutally smashed. Do not come to this game at all, for thine brain shall be spared from having to keep the terrible memories of playing this game. But seriously, do come to this game looking for a great character customization, it's one of the only pros I could think of, and it's quite possibly the only positive aspect of this entire game. Aside from playing it with some good friends of course, but even that's not available to everyone 24/7.

3333	0	a	The game si old and full of cheaters. I don't recommend this game is those days :D.
3334	0	a	While I enjoyed playing this game initially, the micro transactions and repetitive gameplay made this game feel like a pay to win platform. The customizability of your character is top notch, but doesnâ€™t excuse the fact itâ€™s simply not fun to play.
3335	0	a	Want to try an MMO that's Free to Play!? This game has some of the best customization out of any game I've ever played. You can customize your character's clothing, appearance, tattoos, and even your car. It's FREE, check it out today!!!  UPDATE (1/1/2016): If I were you, I wouldn't waste your time on APB: Reloaded since it has become a Pay to Win style game. The company that took this game over has changed it from the glory this game once was.   You'd be better off NOT wasting your time with this title.
3336	0	a	Very bad, I can't even play the game. It takes like an hour to load and after that, it crashes. Unless anyone has a solution to this problem, I can't come up with a great review for this game.  1/10

3342	0	a	Game is dying and horrible. Got 7 different max ranks over 5 years, over 10,000 hours. Game is just dead.
3343	0	a	So bugged game, first black screen loading at begginning , second so much lagging but i have a good pc to play it ....
3344	0	a	Plagued by an awful dev, horrid community, and no resemblance of a fair match making system, this is a game that is aimed to appeal to whales and grade A try-hards. There is no in between.  I finially quit today after giving it an honest effort. My performance was not bad, but i can draw no joy from this toxic community. Too many missions lost because the entire team has grenade launchers but no one they're fighting is even half way done progressing towards them. Too many high skill rating players in low skill districts. Too many max rank players farming noobs. Its disgusting, and G1 does nothing to stop it.
3345	0	a	this game can be good game but because the managers of the game that only make stuff to sell in real money (weapons,cars,clothes) and they doesn't fix the hit regs and to try to fix the game and to make new engine. that why it's bad game.
3346	0	a	does not load not worth the download
3347	0	a	This game sucks. way to much bs just to get to the part where you actually play. just a lame game period

3349	0	a	This game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing suck â™¥â™¥â™¥ it WILL NOT STOP â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING RUNNING AND ITS MAKING ME LAG  
3350	0	a	I haven't played for very long, but that doesn't mean I can't say that I don't like it. It tries to be like GTA but ends up being a freemium-esque game. Horrible quality. Zero stars.
3351	0	a	This game is a pay to play type of game, when it first came out before I had steam the game was fun. But now its disappointing to say the least. I am sure if you had plenty of spare money to just throw at the game then it would be fun again. Not to mention, that people are rude. Even people who are 'supposed to team with you' they will do whatever it takes just to mess up the game or mission' needless to say... I dislike it. It is free however. Definitely wouldnt waste hard earned cash on it though.
3352	0	a	This tryhard tried hard to like this game but it fails hard especially as a FTP.  Lots of neat customizations but none of that can make up for the repetitive missions and gameplay. Having no PVE you can only progress in the game by playing the missions against players. Most of the time I get put up against high level 'Premium' players who resort to cowardly tactics. Players will mostly try to run you over or use explosives. Cant shoot driver out of car. They like camping with a supply box and spamming grenades. Apparently OP pistols and submachine gun pistols seems to be favored.  Despite being the first to fire, being accurate with the rifle, hitting them 50 times (no joke) they can snipe you with a pistol or rush right up to you and kill you in 10 shots sometimes less. Yet those same players get attitude and send whispers calling me a noob and a cheater the moment I manage to kill them which seems quite ironic. All in all that I can still find a few good challenging matches with nice people where the ammount of effort to kill/be killed is equal. Sadly the game either has a major gap between level, Premium, or lacks legit players. 
3353	0	a	Played a long time before it hit steam, before it hit the wreck of a company called gamersfirst. If you see a game run by gamersfirst just know their real name is gamerslast.

3361	0	a	the graphics are just horrible, the gamelay itself is wacky and killing someone in a match is not just difficult but their health gets restored. I know that its a game but if someone shoots you, youre not magically gonna get restored health. the only good thngs in this game is the driving, the character customization and thats it. the game is just a bad gta copy its horrible in my opinion and its a pay to win game. dont waste time on it.
3362	0	a	Don't even try this sh*t. I gave this game a lot of chances, but doesn't worth a second lossed on this game. Don't loss your time for this kind of sh*t. Belive me, you will regret it for a lifetime.   I will share few things I saw in this game, that will brings your so much nervous and also will 'push you away' from this game: â€¢ The 'anti-cheat' system it's crap. Doesn't do anything at all.  â€¢ Matchmaking balance in this game it's 'amazing' too. Or, I better said, there is no balance in the game. â€¢ This game should be renamed to: Pay 2 Win: Reloaded. (simple as that) â€¢ Engine of this game it's crap. Full of bugs. Everything looks stupid on this game, even you are playing on high perf PC, you will have lag, frozing, dropping fps, etc. The buildings looks like cardboard box from some low-budget cartoon. â€¢ Lot of unnecessary and unclear informations on the screen and everywhere in the APB World. â€¢ The red-cross hit symbol means that you hit the target...NOPE, that means you hit everything in front of your target, but not him.  Recommendation: Don't try this game ever! That's why they made this game free. Better collect money and buy GTA V. It worth buying and playing that game online.
3363	0	a	its like a horrible version of GTA SA ONLINE.
3364	0	a	will not load and cant close 
3365	0	a	couldn't even play the game becasue it would never recognize my account and I know I put the password and username in right
3366	0	a	I keep getting kicked and it doesn't tell me why. 'Player kicked for following reason:' and then there's a blank space. I haven't been able to play for longer than 1 minute at a time
3367	0	a	It sucks now... why? BECAUSE OF THE STUPID LAUCHER REFUSING TO WORK! Don't waist a total of 2 hrs of repairs and stuff plus solutions are useless. END OF STORY
3368	0	a	This was good when I played it in the closed beta under RealtimeWorlds, but since it got taken up by Gamersfirst all it has turned into is a F2P with micro-transactions where paying gets you the best weapons and unlocks. I recommend to STAY AWAY from this game at ALL COSTS. The new dev/publisher has completely unbalanced the game's core gameplay by giving the premium players the best weapons instead of allowing everyone to gain and maintain the use of the weapons, not to meantion the overpowered premium vehicles compared to the free ones. This game was designed by RealtimeWorlds to be a Single-payment game - you by the disk/game key and that would be all you pay. This new system, as I've said already, has BROKEN the the game's CORE GAMEPLAY.  Score out of ten when under RealtimeWorlds: 8.5 Out Of 10 Score out of ten while under Gamersfirst: 2 Out Of 10  AVOID
3369	0	a	Get GTA V and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on it while tearing it to shreads. Then you have APB Reloaded. GTA V online is for you if you want to do it. 60 USD, but MUCH MORE FUN AS WELL AS FREE UPDATES.
3370	0	a	Good game a realy good game. But this is more like log in simulator.   1/10

3372	0	a	Game play 0/10  Uninstall play 10/10
3373	0	a	This game is a total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! After playing almost 200 hours + 100 before merging on Steam on my old account, i can easily say that this game is the worst Sandbox-MMO EVER! I've spent almost 100 bucks on it. Yeah, 100 BUCKS! This game is total PAY TO WIN, if you're not paying, you cant win. Also, cars, skins, guns are for real money too! And the community is the most toxic i've ever met! Seriously, even CS GO community is less toxicated that this piece of garbage! Also the optimalization of the game leaves A LOT to wish, if you're having 50 fps you are in the top 100 PC rank propably.  So, the game is a total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that costs nothing to download and to rage over it besides nerves, but it costs a lot to really play it. Who the hell thought about doing P2W system in APB? Oh, yes, the studio whose said that they are going to make the game alive. I see. DO NOT DOWNLOAD, PLAY OR BUY ANYTHING FROM THEIR WORKSHOP EVER!
3374	0	a	10/10 would get called a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ again for learning how to play.
3375	0	a	All Pounds Spent is a very good game when u have 420$ worth weapons.

3379	0	a	Wellfare GTA 5 Online.  With somehow even more hackers.
3380	0	a	Gameplay is not smooth at all, and it is unoriginal. Well, atleast I did not loose any money, time, or my soul to this game
3381	0	a	got lost instantly 11/10 where's the anything
3382	0	a	I don't really like this game. It isn't what i thought i was going to be. You need to Pay to Win in this game. Can't really understand how to drive a car in this game. Because, when i press 'D', the wheel will turn 1 second after i presses 'D'
3383	0	a	Game was awesome, too bad it WAS... That was one of the best 3rd person shooter I have ever played, too bad this game is stucked at beta and its release date - 2011y... I have more than 12000h play off steam, max ranked, having collection of most legendary weapons, I havent payed a single cent for modifications, and im actually feeling good that i didnt putted any of my money into this game, gonna give some reasons... 1st things new players has to know - game is total P2W... If you are not going to pay money on this thing - you will regret starting playing this thing... If you are player that has bigger rank than 100 and you get gold, you gonna get f*cked up by c*nts that either cheat or are P2W, having all the weapons bought from G1M... 2nd thing would be stucking in 2011 year, in whole my huge gameplay experience i had only 1 patch, that added some new weapons, vehicles and some modifications in the game (Yes, Im talking about rising max rank until 255R and adding 2 new characters)... 3rd thing - they started nerfing legendary old school weapons like sitting ducks and ect., making to spend even more money on new legendaries or G1M shop, I totally do not support any of these things... 4th would be server instability, game had great stability until community started asking new anti cheating systems, that totally destroyed stability, and havent helped a bit from cheaters. 5th - unreasonable banning just because some ppl complained that you hack, just because they are better than reporters, thats how i got my 1st account banned - without evidences and stupid reasons... 6th would be hilariously stupid matchmaking and balances - Gold guys are playing in silver servers, silvers play in bronze, and bronze dont have where to run from silvers, the other thing would be about golden players 7th - gold players... If you got gold in game - you can say goodbye to game, because gold is the place where P2W and hackers plays, if you get there, prepare for the worst... I stopped playing this game and dont play it for &gt;1 year now, because i realised G1 cares only the smell of fresh earned dirty money... I totally DO NOT RECOMMEND SPENDING A SINGLE BUCK ON THIS CRAP, SO DEVS WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOING TO LOSE ALL THE PLAYERS, AND I PERSONALLY HOPE IT WILL HAPPEN 1 DAY! Sorry if my review contain mistakes, nobody is perfect, but the game IS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION. -8/10

3391	0	a	APB Reloaded is pretty much deviant art packaged into a .exe. I feel tremendous pain for those who have paid money on this incarnation of this game, which feels like a time capsule as there has still been no meaningful addition to what it offers players even after years of 'development'.  I made a Harlem Globetrotter though so I shall rate this game a 8/10.
3392	0	a	There is no such thing as headshots on this game. Shoot a guy in the head with a sniper and he will laugh and kill you with an automatic rifle while you reload. It seems like every window on the cars are bulletproof. The physics of this game are so messed up.   There is rarely any PvE which is fine. All your missions will be done against the opposition. This makes it hard for a beginner to get sold into the game especially when you have all the seasoned players crowding the newbie district. The tutorial is poor and doesn't explain some of the important mechanics like how to aim-outside-the-window of your buddy's car while he is driving. The elitist get mad when you don't play the game how they want you to play it. Its like they have their own little code of conduct.   I was looking for a clone to replace GTA but I guess I would rather play GTA instead. If you are expecting this game to be an alternative to GTA then you will be disappointed. The only thing this game has going for it is the customization(character, music playlist, guns, cars, and etc). Other than that, the game will make you mad and wish it would improve. Game has potential but the mechanics just are not fit for me.

This game is fun but is a broken peace of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ shooter that you can play if you want to but if this game was not free I would not recommend it at all. And btw to start this game is a nightmare the first time. 2/10
3409	0	a	doesnt even launch just takes you to a facebook page   EDIT: managed to get past the facebook page issue it launched closed itself out after about a minute then locked up my steam and i cant get rid of it i have no options but to restart my computer to be able to play any real games and delete this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so in end if you want to break steam download this game and have fun breaking steam i sure as hell didnt

3413	0	a	So APB has had a rocky road. Real Time Worlds was the first company to develop and make APB. However, the game was plagued with issues. From talk of supposed ex employes, the game was rushed out for lack of funds. Some employees cam out and posted concept art and plans for what they wanted to do with the game but couldn't because lack of funds. It sounds amazing.  So you had this game come out and it was horrible. The optimization was in a horrid state. Griefing and hackers everywhere. Horrible progression system. Some horrible missions. General horrible map design. To top it off...it cost 15$ a month to play.  Needless to say, it failed. It went under. RTW went out of business (hence the in memorium at the start of the game). The game I think lasted like 2 months? G1st bought them up later in 2010.   Sadly...they've done nothing with it. Lets go over the major changes they've made to the game.  1. New Anti-hack system - this helped with the hackers, but there will always be hackers in the game. Its in a much better state, but as a f2p game...you know how it goes.   2. Fightclub - Essentially they took parts of the pre existing map, put up barriers around it, put it into its own instance, then threw 12v12 battles into it over certain objectives. Not really adding anything. Mainly just...re-arranging stuff.   3. Joker Tickets - a special currency from fight club. I will say that they did add in quite a few items to be used with joker tickets.  4. Cash Shop Introduction  5. Numerous cash shop guns  6. Numerous cash shop clothing  7. Numerous cash shop cars/kits  8. Festival events that often have a heavy cash shop undertone   9. New 'end game' NPC that sells new clothing/gear  10. New equipment/consumables  11. Performance fixes/bug fixes/optimization  12. Removal of 'bad' missions and poor designed missions  13. A 'better' matchmaking system  So over the past 6 years, those are the major things that have been accomplished. As you can see, they didn't really add anything into the game. The major things that can be considered additions are the cash shop related stuff, one NPC that is at the very end, better anti hacker, and their gear, and joker tickets gear. Fightclub wasn't really an addition since they're basically just copy and pasting pre-existing code and blocking off a section of a map that is already there. The asylum is a special fight club only map, but even that is rumored to not be made by g1st. Apparently it already existed in the game files but wasn't quite ready for released. I think it took them like 3-4 years to released it.   Now there are problems that existed in the game with RTW...that still exist.   1. Matchmaking. It's horrible. See there are two things in the game. You have a threat level and a rank level. Now I think the max rank is 255. Rank is required to use some gear and generally tells you how long a player has been playing. Imagine this being like levels in a standard MMORPG. Higher ranks have access to more gear, equipment, upgrades, cars, etc. Threat level tells you how 'good' you are. You go from trainie, green, bronze, silver, gold. It's insanely easy to get gold if you're even moderately good. So how does the MM work? It only takes into account threat level. So I've been in situations where you have a rank 50-110 with low level gear going up against a highly geared 255 rank in gold districts. Heck, even silver districts have this issue. It doesn't end there.  Now this game has districts. Districts are split by threat level. Gold can join gold and silver districts. Silver can join (I think) gold, silver, and bronze. Bronze can join silver, bronze, and green. A gold can't join a bronze district for example. What people do is intentionally lose games to lower their threat level to join lower districts. I just had a fight where you me and one other silver and a traine going up against two rank 150+ gold players in a bronze district.    http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/391733-matchmaking-at-its-best/   That's a good indicator at how bad the MM is at its current state. Even with their attempts to fix it.   2. Horrible Map Design. They never really tried to fix some of the map issues. In terms of a shooter, it's still bad. Full of choke points, campable areas, and just general frustration. There are freeways in the game and they're what they sound like...big open freeways. People love to get snipers and sit on them because they're insanely hard to take out since you have to find a ramp and hope you can make it to the sniper before he shoots you as you drive across a big open area.   3. Edge of p2w. Right now the game is basically 'pay money for good gear now'. Most of the guns/weapons you can get in game. Personally I consider 'pay real money now or spend 30+ hours working towards the same gun' to be p2w.   4. Progression is slow. You need to progress roles and contacts to get certain gear. Some gear like upgrades require you to use a weapon to unlock upgrades for it. So if you want to get a certain upgrade for your assault rifle, you've got to use your assault rifle a ton. So if you're in a gold district there's a chance you'll be fighting highly customized weapons with a unmodded weapon. It's very frustrating.  5. Horrible Mission Design. So the only thing they touched with the mission system is taking out missions. Sadly, they can't take them out (that would mean they have to make more). There are still horrible ones. Two off the top of my head. One is called VIP. A player on one team is selected to be VIP and everyone in the game can see the big VIP marker from anywhere on the map. Through walls, etc. Basically taking out any sort of stealth strategy for one team. The VIP has a set amount of lives and the attacking team has a set amount of lives. Putting the entire games success on the hands of one individual that may or may not be horrible (and is handicapped with a 'wallhack' so to speak) is very frustating. I hate being the VIP. It's not fun. Another one is where each team gets a big marker above the head of each member and a set amount of lives for the team. Basically a TDM. Again, no stealth. The amount of times I've seen people standing behind walls looking at one another with third person view waiting for the other to move is a ton. Or they all go to some insanely easy campable area only counterable with a nade launcher (which is like an endgame, last unlocked weapon). Or worse, they get enough kills to be considered 'winning' and then they run around the map running the clock.   6. Optimzation issues. Still huge FPS drops randomly. I think it has something to do with the gun smoke. I can run Gw2, GTA V, planetside 2, elite dangerous, etc etc. However, I still get horrible FPS drops in this game. Apparently they're making a new renderer which I hope will help the game. It's very frustrating to get into a firefight and have your FPS Drop to like 2-5 randomly in the middle of it.   7. Spawning. Spawning in both Fightclub and the vanilla mode is horrible. For example on the VIP thing. The amount of times I've been spawned in road right in the sights of an enemy sniper is a lot. Or wayyy far away from any team members and closer to enemies. Today I was playing fightclub capturing a point and TWO enemies spawned next to the point and killed me. So lame.   The major reason that this game is pulling the numbers it does (peaks at around 2300 right now) is because there's no other game like it. GTA V did put a dent in the population. APB averaged around 2100 players the same month as GTA V release and some months before that. After it released it has been dropping till what it is now...averaging 1400 player. If they actually did something with this game in the 6 years they've owned it, I'd recommend it. Right now it seems like they're putting forth minimal effot to keep it alive and makin money. Maybe they've spent all this time prepping it for console release

3422	0	a	cancer, i don't even know why i downloaded it.
3423	0	a	This game has been completely ruined by the devs.   Instead of it being Free, they should actually pay us to play this thing.  Seriously, buy GTA V if you wanna play a game like this, spare yourself the suffering.
3424	0	a	Fastest and most efficient way to obtain terminal autism
3425	0	a	It was a great game until they change the game. The server so laggy when they put the server together {west and east}. Building load slow, bad community and banned for no reason even if its 'skills'. I believe the banning is causing the game to be low population 'silver is now gold' from what i heard. I hope they fix the game ASAP or its gonna go POOF.
3426	0	a	F4ck This Game.
3427	0	a	WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY A PISTOL FOR 99 CENTS IN REAL MONEY? 
3428	0	a	game sucks. it doesnt even load up for me and for some reason everytime I wanna play the game it has to install everything again which takes about 2 minutes. Just play Killing Floor 2 instead people this game is horrible
3429	0	a	I can't even play it -.-, Can someone help?
3430	0	a	Got kicked for joining a world
3431	0	a	There's Hackers everywhere, pay to win, people with auto aim mods and I get banned for cursing while these kids walking with moded guns. Dont play this unless you into getting destroyed by hackers and paying players.
3432	0	a	This game is not even loading i said BULLSH*T and start smashing my keybored
3433	0	a	The most Pay 2 Win game ever created in Universe, if you like to be killed in 0,05 sec by a Player who bought premium weapons than this is your pick! Enjoy repetative missions while being called noob cause you didn't pay to win, unload 7 clips of ammo in to one guy who then kills you with 2 shots from a pistol. Only thing that is fine in the game is costumization options. This game is the worst crap ever ressurected to be a Money Milking Machine. Don't play this game.
3434	0	a	The game is not bad but...  It is hyper casual; bullet drop/damage are completely silly. If you are looking for a tactical team based competative shooter with realism and skill continue your search or I recommend CS:GO. If you want to have fun screw around and just blow stuff up and play grand theft auto for free, this is your game.  The review may seem harsh but it isn't a bad game just know what you want from your games and play it!
3435	0	a	Can be a very fun game. I was a criminal (obiously who downloads a game like this to be a cop). The game was amasing before they made it a pay to win with alot of hackers everywhere. All the guns bought with ingame currency are crap compaired to the guns bought with real money.  I also noticed from day 1 that for some reason the turning in cars is very delayed, at first i thought it was my computer as i was playing on a acer aspire laptop. Got a $1600 gaming pc that i built myself, turning still as delayed as before.   It can be fun with friends or alone, but the cops dont really do anything. My brother and I saved up together so i could buy a van. Thought we would have alot of fun robbing store fronts and running from the cops. Finaly got the van. Do alot of robberys. Got bored. Do a robbery litteraly infront of a cop. He just sits there watching us fill the van with TVs and safes and does nothing. Finaly got a cop to chase me. He drives straight into a wall when i turn because he for some reason cant turn.  Its a good game but its not worth the time you have to put into it for it to be fun. You have to try it out for your self and see if you like it. If your looking for a Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row feeling game this is not it.
3436	0	a	If you don't spend money you wont have a chance
3437	0	a	lags like a dogs â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you dont have a pre good pc and is about as fun as watching dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dry to play 4/10

3440	0	a	never loads my people
3441	0	a	I do not reccomend anyone to waste his time by playing this game. It's poorly made and very inbalanced. The match-making system is terribly broken. You'll often find yourself, a low lvl 5 guy against lvl 200 players. It's very frustrating, progress is very slow and unrewarding. The game is very poorly made and optimized, the physics engine is terrible, steering lags a whole 3-4 seconds making car driving close to imposible. The game is full of trolls and rammers and the overall atmosphere of this game is of hate. The most commonly typed sentence in this game is 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ y0u N00B di3 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!' Many players were banned for no reason because of an upsurge of cheaters and with every patch the game just keeps getting worse, the only additions being new stuff to rob money from you with. I DO NOT Reccomend this garbage to anyone.
3442	0	a	why play a game that doesnt work?

3449	0	a	there is nothing to do in this game
3450	0	a	Dreadful. Punkbuster, whom i assume is the equivalent of valve. Doesn't include the full game in the steam download. You actually have to manually patch the game or you get kicked every 2 or 3 minutes in game which takes about a 30 second load screen in and out. The game looks cool but literally one of the worst installs on steam
3451	0	a	Wow this game is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. First of all, they don't even give you a tutorial so your just pushed into the game with no instructions what so ever. When you first get into the world, there isn't even a clear understanding on what to do. Do you go to the mailbox? Do you go to this place? You have no idea. Not only do you get no tutorial of any kind but you also are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed if your on your own. There's a reason this game died once, it was a giant pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Why try to polish â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Reloaded?
3452	0	a	This game is really bad.
3453	0	a	The launcher is buggy as hell. It won't boot the game, it just opens your default browser with an ad to 'like us' on Facebook. Game won't launch.

3459	0	a	I love this game, I really do. I just wish it wasn't pay to win, I wish it wasn't so laggy, I wish the cars would turn when I hit the key to turn it and not have a 10 second delay, and I wish there wasn't so many â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s in the servers.
3460	0	a	This game has fun gameplay but the pay 2 win ruins it, if this game wouldn't be pay 2 win it would be pretty decent/semi-bad but it's not. are you skillful? this is not the game for you, are you good at spending TONS of mommys money to become an in-game stripper with rocket lauchers? download now for 'free'!
3461	0	a	Download, click play. Open popups in Firefox randomly, Close popups. Opens random instaler for updates, takes an hour on 50mbps fiber optic line, once updated click Start, never starts. Bring up control pannel, it's running, end process, repeat that action 3 times, game starts, black box around screen because it can't support my huge tvs high rez, overly long tacky loading screens, then logs me in with steam, then asks for Email to create account. Nhilisticly shake head, uninstall. 10 turds out of 10, would not turd again.
3462	0	a	this game is f*cken â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, no wonder it was free.. Download time took forever, Load time..eternity.. Worst game ever. save yourself the time.

3466	0	a	i cant even play this game. i downloaded it through steam and started it up, it took me to a launcher where i had to register on a gaming site and made me redownload the game again via that site.  why cant i just play it though steam?  ill change my review once i play it...if this gets fixed of course. im not playing from the other site because my disk space is low and i dont see the point in having 2 of the same games
3467	0	a	APB Reloaded is personally one of my favourite game. You can customise your character and your car! The guns are quite well-balanced.  However, there are many issue that is a hinderance to the game. Such examples will be unstable latency where if you stay in a country far from the server, you will not be able to move your character and shoot smoothly as people who stay in the country that has the server. Another problem is the premium guns where some free-players and beginners will find themselves in a serious disadvantage compared to premium players who has wide range of guns suited to their situations.  APB is one of those games where it feels good to play at first, but as times goes on, you will find yourself in a battle of keeping your interest alive of playing the game.  I give this a 5/10.   -Kiro
3468	0	a	God Awful. I have been playing this game for like a month or 2 and it f***ing sucks. Sure you can customize weapons and cars n' stuff but the online gameplay just sucks. I ready in and wait 30 minutes for a mission and my other teammates wont even do the mission, they kill me when I try doing something(friendly fire X_X) and tell me they're 'priming'(from what i heard is not doing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ untill a police force comes to the scene) and yelled at me for being a noob. I as a rookie game developer tell the developers 'you're doing great with customization, but PLEASE set up a better matchmaking system'. for the players i say 'Just play GTA Online, this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ just sucks'. oh and one more thing developers 'WHY THE HELL CAN I ONLY RENT GUNS'. thank you
3469	0	a	i hate this stupid game i got 6 accounts banned with 5.000$ wasted on them. dont try to play this game and gamersfirst is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all they do is just steal money and bann yourr acc. I recommend you guys not to get it and btw i have never hack in my apb account in none of them and boom! This account has been blocked (10008) I LOST 6 ACCOUNT because of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tards they make allot of money because of their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t
3470	0	a	This game is CRAP seriously i wasted 1090 hours on bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the missons are the same , people are actually hacking , fairfight banning random people for being good and PAY TO FU=KING WIN is bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ its more like pay to lose and get banned
3471	0	a	Didn't load so I got 40 something hrs with out doing anything
3472	0	a	wow this game is garbage. i tried so hard. gg worst game.
3473	0	a	Pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tbh, anyone thinking to get into this game should just buy The Division.  Everything APB does, The Division does better imo.
3474	0	a	It's not really that great to me...but that might just be the lag I get...
3475	0	a	Wow gud thing to test uninstall button....#Pay2Win
3476	0	a	just stated after spending an hour creating my caracter there are only three servers with one being unusable  being in the us the only server close enough was a ue sever which was pumping out a ping of 158 not very good  then it took forever to get in the server 30min. after i got in no more that five minutes i get kicked.   in short this game is a wast of time and effort to people looking for a good game to play when no one is taking good care of it in the first place. its like they made it stayed with it and inproved it for a little wile and then abandond it.
3477	0	a	Very, VERY bad first experience. When I downloaded this game i had to wait over 4 hours to be able to join my server (EU), then when I was able to join, I was there for like 10 minutes until the server crashed... I'm probably just gonna uninstall now.
3478	0	a	After 5 years the game still has delays that exist for no reason and you can still shoot through walls.
3479	0	a	i dont like it, you shouldn't either          don't ask why
3480	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ONE OF THE WORST GAME EVER.  I JUST CANT PLAY THIS. BECUZ SERVER IS BLOW ALL THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING TIME
3481	0	a	Had fun for many hours, until I realized that I kept on getting beaten by lvl 1's because they decided to be P2W and buy rocket launchers and all kinds of crazy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  This game is 80% P2W, and 20% actual fairness.
3482	0	a	$%#^ PUNKBUSTER! All i have to say!
3483	0	a	You need to spend to much money for have decent things.  I like it for a long time but, is not for my like now.   And now i can't download it, so, try to thing better about your fans.
3484	0	a	This game is just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, getting dced every 30 min. bad match up, server is dead.
3485	0	a	I have not play the game yet even though that it says I played 1.3 hours, the game just wouldn't start, it ran even with my computer shut down. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE! This will change when the developers fix what ever problems this game has. I got interested by watching YouTuber Rapid99 play this.
3486	0	a	I played this game thinking it would be like GTA with vigilantes, but it was just a medium sized map, with mission after mission, with no sense of self! I didn't feel like a criminal because they kept telling me that I had to make friends with other gangs, and it's also really hard to distinguish another criminal with an enforcer. Overall, I felt short-changed, even though I got this for free.
3487	0	a	It's been trying to launch for 40 minutes now and I'm still looking at my desktop background
3488	0	a	Its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, dont get it its not worth the space
3489	0	a	Can't even launch the game anymore. Tried every possible fix or workaround. Reinstalled 3 times.
3490	0	a	nothing but pay2win and hackers and trolls.

3494	0	a	If u ready pay for cool new stuff than itÂ´s a game suited for you. The Hackers make the game impossible to enjoy. The Game itself would be better if the dev would change this into leveling through. I know everyone wants to make money but be so greedy is worse. GTA Online is the same if u have money than you rule. Btw the basic idea for the game is good and it would be a great game to waste u time on it if they remove the p2w.
3495	0	a	It might say I only have 50 hours, but I mostly played without steam on another account. I played atleast 600 hours of APB in total.  Whatever you do, don't play this game. It's trash, such pay to win. The legendary weapons are way too overpowered and expensive, all the free weapons hardly match up and even if they do, they have been buffed with modifications which p2w weapons already have those. Gamers First doesn't fix any bugs in APB, this is the buggiest multiplayer game I have ever seen. They can't even fix the fighting club bug where it reverts your progress when you reach the gold place.  I kept saying to myself : - This game will get fixed one day, it will become even better.  I was wrong. I actually spent some cash on this game just to get banned 3 months later for.... for.... nothing. My account got a random block out of the blue. I wrote a ticket only to be greeted by a bot which simply stated that my account was banned for 3rd party application use. DOES â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SKYPE COUNT??! NO? THEN HOW IN THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I GOT A PERMA BAN? I am not the first one to be banned for absolutely nothing.   The worst part is that I lost the weapon I bought for over 40$...  The game it self has a great concept, but the company only wants money. Don't even get me started on the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t events they do...  Overall, I don't recommend this game for : Poor customer service, in-game p2w shop, sloopy events, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ server/game maintenance, unfair bans.
3496	0	a	 ~3000hrs spent actively playing outside of steam
3497	0	a	Okay I heard this a pretty good game but I cant play it because i figured i needed to download a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of stuff fit=rst then it cant play on windows 10 if they can fix I'll recommend it but for now no stars
3498	0	a	the leaning system is crap beacuse you have to aim in order to lean and it goes into a over the shoulder POV witch is crap i feel like what would make this game better is if it was both 1st and 3rd POV
3499	0	a	to many micro transations 
3500	0	a	Game used to be fun. I've been a player since about 2013. Got some ups and down, but it was mostly fun. Today, as I come back to play with my friend and wait for the upcoming halloween event, I get perma banned for 'breaking the terms and service'. How can someone break the rules of the game if they haven't played in 3 months? Really sad as this game was really fun, and they are now banning innocent players for others crimes.
3501	0	a	I can't say I actually would recommend this game. That doesn't mean it's not a fun game some of the time, but usally it's honestly pretty bad. You'll get lucky if you find some people who aren't hacking, scum bag trolls or self-procalimed 'pro-players.' The people you'll typically run into are your average scum bags who will constantly tell you how bad you are and that you suck and blah blah blah even though they can't seem to win the match either. BUT when you do find some good people and get in a group, the game can be pretty fun. The customization is very good too, plus there should be an game engine update sometime in 2016 as well.   Edit: Yeah that engine update still hasn't happened.
3502	0	a	I like this game quite a lot, which is why I have 258.4 hours in it, but I can't recommend it becuase it uses the worst anti cheat known to man. We mortals merely call it 'punkbuster' this god awful invention is believed to date back to Soviet times where Soviet scientists were thinking what the best way to ruin the western games market was. They decided that the absolutely best way was to make a anti-cheat so horrible that it kicks random people off server, aswell as scan your files when you are not even on the game. So in summary great game but uses anti-cheat developed by the soviets to troll gamers.
3503	0	a	total garbage. its pay to win, and they also banned me for no god damn reason. i had just made an account TODAY and played for a total of like. 5 minutes. then got sent back to home screen saying my account is blocked. 10008 or some crap. definite waste of time and storage space. DO NOT DOWNLOAD
3504	0	a	Used to be fun :( Community=toxic Devs=money hungry Waste of time and money to play it now.
3505	0	a	Spent 26 or so hours on the game, So.. Have enough room to talk. The game? Good. The servers? unplayable. If you're not lagging all over the place , Players don't even go into their own districts. Yes, their is districts. I'm threat level silver, But, If I go into silver district, theirs gold threat everywhere, and if you go into ANY lobby with them on the other team? Have fun dieng 40 times &amp; losing. Their is no way to beat them, as they have better weapons, armor, cars, etc.. Which, forces people into lower districts, meaning silver threat go to bronze, and.. as you can already tell, that creates 2 more problems. 1: pretty much the same thing, bronze can't kill silver. And, You get raged at if you are, silver.   So.. I give this game 3/10. Will play it, But NEVER recommend it. Nor invite friends to it. The Devs don't seem to do anything about it. And due to server issue/districts , The only time you'll have fun, is when you're killing people at a noticeable level below you. Which.. Gives 0 satisfaction that you're doing.. anything.
3506	0	a	no support from the company when you lose money on a purchase do no use
3507	0	a	Me and my friend tried playing it , well wasn't very fun . P2W
3508	0	a	I HOPE THIS GAME CRASHES all it is a pay to win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and thats unfair to people that cant aford it why dont they make 2 servers one for paying people and one for non paying people
3509	0	a	Used to play this game back when RTW had it in BETA, Back then it was GREAT! Could of brought something special to the next generation games. But they flopped, and G1 Bought the game, and It has turned into a typical G1 Game.  Cheaters every mission, lack of massive development ( except for the cash shop ) and even a favourtisim from the developers to certain clans, due to them 'knowing' someone in that clan.  Would not recommend playing.  5/10 Because it WAS a good game.
3510	0	a	I have about 500 hours on this game and I can say at the start it is really pay 2 win but later on the Weapons you are able to modify can be WAY better than the Premium Weapons.If you dont have money for GTA 5 and look for an alternative....Dont get this game it will cost more than GTA 5 later on but if you have friend definitly play this Game! Anyway a Dislike because of the Prices!!!
3511	0	a	Game Status Long Ago: Very Playable, Good Latency  Game Status Now: Unplayable, Horrible Latency   The Latency beats over all the customization with nearly 1000 latency playing normal.  The game is just unplayable now.
3512	0	a	Oh APB, the years I've spent playing. LAGGGGG. This game is the definition of bittersweet. Customization is the best thing this game has going for it. Create your own music, death themes(can be very annoying), cusomize your cars and customize your player(hair, height, weight, tatoos, ect...). This game has its own little producing software that isn't the best, but worth messing around with. The concept of this game is still great even though the exicution is terrible. There is too much wrong about this game but the worst thing about this game is the community. The missions are repetitive with no real storyline unless you want to read about the story when you level up contacts through the in game mail system. Any gun that give and advantage of course are all P2W exect a few that you have to grind for and buy from the marketplace where players can trade/sell guns, cars, songs, death themes, and logos(more that I can't remember atm). Their subscription is called premium and gives you basically 100% more in came currency and experience towards leveling up contacts(how you unlock non p2w items) The winning team of the mission only really matters who wins the final portion of the mission unless your team sucks much more that the opponents. Matchmaking is terrible although there are not enough players to really balance it. Spawn points can be very frustrating and much bs for the other team most of the time. After years of playing this game, I can say I've wasted hours just to unlock the overpowered nano automatic pistol. Once I obtained this goal, I uninstalled after really giving the game a chance. I cant reccomend this game for anyone to play because it is such a let down and pro players will give you your @$$ on a platter. The devs have promised a game engine update and have not done so. It is well over a year overdue. RIP APB it was fun while it lasted...

3519	0	a	Honestly, this game has gotten pretty good on PC, they are really working to improve the community by banning hackers, and releasing frequent updates on how the game development is going.  However I'm not going to talk about the PC version, I'm going to talk about the Xbone version which seems to be doing terrible as of this moment. I mostly want to talk about false bans but there are other issues I will address here as well.  First the game was super laggy and broken when released, which is to be expected. However it still frequently crashes and lags up pretty hard despite the 'fixes' they have released.  The community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but that comes with territory.  So I personally don't play the xbone version, I'm pretty loaded on PC and I'd rather not start over. My girlfriend however, plays the game almost religously. The clan she is in is pretty huge in the community, and is well known for elite players who have way too much time on their hands. Recently however a rival clan started PAYING people (he admitted to it, the owner has a recording of it) to mass report members of the clan my girlfriend is in. Pretty much half the clan has gotten false bans at this point, and G1's only response is 'we don't issue false bans' even after posting said proof of false mass reports, they just ignored it. The man in question paying his clannies to false report, is sitting back, laughing, and bragging in social about how he's gotten an entire clan banned, and G1 STILL refuses to do anything about it.  This is beyond pathetic, some of these players have already put quite a bit of money into the game. So why would it bennefit them to mod their xbone, and hack in APB? Also why haven't they been console locked for modding console and 'detected' hacks yet?   Exactly, because there was no wrong-doings on the part of said clan, except they were rivals with another huge clan that just wanted them out of the picture, and G1 doesn't give a single â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about what goes on in the community, only what they feel is right and wrong will be addressed.  SOOOOO, until they decide to start giving a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the xbone, which a lot of players have now moved to, or started playing. I'm not putting another â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing penny into this game.
3520	0	a	I did a previous review explaining why this was still a good game and delved into the issues with hackers and defended this company and game full heartedly. I then got false banned for 'hacking' under the new FairFight anticheat system, along with many others.   This was just another slap in the face by the ironically named 'Gamers First' company. Literally no proof is needed to be banned; so play this at your own risk because you are guaranteed to be an ignored, unvalued player.  I suggest that if the same thing has happened to you, consider filing a complaint against them to the BBB, they might still get away with it for now but eventually action will have to be taken. This is not okay and this company is scamming players.
3521	0	a	I cant even get the game to load! the launcher has MANY, MANY problems that need fixing. even when I can get past the launcher the game wont load, so I dont really have any oppinion towards the game/gameplay but this game need alot of help. I also asked a friend how he got the game to work because i saw him playing it, but he replied with 'I havent even gotten it to work, ive just been stuck in the launcher trying to fix it'
3522	0	a	Ignore the Mostly Positive sign.  Even Uninstall doesn't work properly. 
3523	0	a	LOL! Surprised this game is around still.. Its like the only people who play it are either fanboys or tryhards.
3524	0	a	Worst game I ever played(money sucker).
3525	0	a	Garbage, stay clear. 2/10 Great character creation and customization, nothing else worth mention.
3526	0	a	This game is the 1 of the biggest POS games iv played in a while it automaticly made me a account and set the date to 2015 so cant even play it on the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ list it right next to nether witch i can nolonger play cus it did almost the same thing but its linked to my steam account so i cant make a new account
3527	0	a	I spawned in awaiting a brief tutorial describeing the mechanics and functions of the game and just basic need to know information. what I got was a room with two other playes and a quest log. I steeped out side to take a look at the world and was imedeately hit by what I assume was a rocket laucher. After I respawned I went to take another look and was imeadeately rundown by a player in a car. After all this I still understand whats going on........what is life?
3528	0	a	Let me tell you exactly what happens when you start playing this game: 'Oh cool this is pretty neat character creation, Woah this is just like GTA! Alright lets go on a mission! Oh.. No one sent against me... No one.. No one.. Oh hey new Mission more people! Yeah We're kicking their faces! Woooh! BAM BAM! Awesome I'm feeling good lets do another mission! Wait.. Why do those guys have gold ic- OH GOD MY SPLEEN OH CRIPES MY LIVER! OH GOD NO HOW DO THEY KEEP KILLING ME!?'   And that's how the game continues on, it's nothing more but a free to play game heavily inserted into pay to win, You got money? you have permanent character upgrades. The mtchups are unbelievably unfair even in a matchmaking server.  Not Recomended unless you just want to go Crim and do nothing but carjack or ram into stores.
3529	0	a	well all i have to say about this game is that its completely bull crap because every time u try to log in with your email and password it always gives that error 11386 or something like that and u try looking it up on youtube or something to tell u how to fix it we follow the directions and it still doesnt work and its annoying u cant really enjoy this game when u cant even GET PASS THE FREAKING SIGN IN AND ITS FREAKING ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i highly not recommend this game
3530	0	a	-Weapon balance is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  -MatchMaking is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  those two points ruins the entire game.
3531	0	a	A fairly interesting experiment in human psychology reminiscent of pavlov's dog. An element of chaos was added to test whether or not humans prone addictive stimulus; were capable of forming long term habitual indulgence if they were not guaranteed a reward. This, of course, plays off the humanity's love of 'gambling'. Indeed, other forms of pure gambling are present as well to to give more conclusive results. In addition, Gamersfirst has chosen over the years to stimulate enviromental changes in the form of 'weapon balance' to see if the addictive qualities of the 'game' will hold up under stress.  With no set end date, and the experiment soon to branch out further in scope. I eagerly look forward to the results of Gamerfirst findings. With rigorous testing protocols and such a large sample size. This is surely the most in depth study of the human psyche regarding habitual gambling.  Or hey maybe it's just a poorly managed game by a company looking to make a quick buck while taking four years to develop anything of substance. This game honestly doesn't deserve this kind of abuse, hopefully it'll be put out of it's misery soon.
3532	0	a	I downloaded this game, thinking it looked like a lot of fun. However, as of yet, I have been unable to play as it has been plagued with problem after problem, without ever successfully getting into the game. First, constant 'updating' that never stopped, even though it said everything was up to date. Then, after finally getting passed all that, it said the game was running. I have yet to figure out where it is, in fact, running, other than using memory. Steam says i've played 47 minutes, apparently it counts updating or something for play time. As soon as I restart my computer ( I have to restart it to even delete it ), this game will be gone. I hope they'll get it a little more under control at some point so I can check it out.
3533	0	a	THIS GAME IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T BECAUSE IT DOSEN'T WORK I rated -00.01/10

3536	0	a	Game's horrible. Full of lags, errors and so on. Cheaters are everywhere. This game only got worse after being bought by GF. New company only focuses on getting cash. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.
3537	0	a	wont work for me D:
3538	0	a	Cool game with interesting ideas held back by lag and hackers. Decided to log on after a couple of years to see if things have improved. Chat full of complaints of lag as everything stops to be followed by everyone immediately driving into a wall. Dealt with it awhile to give it a chance because there is a lot of really cool stuff in this game. I finally got into a mission and was immediately killed by a player jumping and spinning snapping to and dropping anyone within line of site. Immediately uninstalled. Would be a worthwhile game if you didn't have to deal with P2WIN, LAG, and HACKERS.
3539	0	a	Boring and repetitive, pay to win, and dominated by hackers.  Still fun to screw around in.
3540	0	a	it messed up my steam pretty bad it constantly says im playing the game so dont play if your impatiant with loading and constantly quit games during loading
3541	0	a	The game took 6 hours to download, made me install another launcher, took another 1/2 hour to finally be able to play. And after all that it told me i didn't have the right computer capabilities.
3542	0	a	Not cool. I have like, a super video card and i waste like 2 hours downloading it to get 'Unable to load dude to video card' FIX PLEASE

3545	0	a	Its not working for me i dont know y???
3546	0	a	no instructions on how to play. Sorta of a tutirial with broken parts.  when you do learn how to do a mission.. it put's experanced players against you to kill you before you even learn how to play the game.  
3547	0	a	I honestly can't recommend this to any new players out (me being one) just due to the fact of how behind you'll be. Now i only played a few hours of this and i will say that this has its goods and its bads.  The goods of APB is the detail it puts into your character, it's amazing; it even beats GTA5's customization with making your own cars, tattoos, decals, guns, and your characters body. The idea is also really good with cops and robbers kinda like a game me and my friends made in GTA4. If you feel like being a punk, pick the criminal; feel like justice, pick the vigilante both sides can just be a sheer blast.  Now the bads and the most obvious one (as you would expect from a free game) is microtransactions.Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game has as many microtransactions as a mobile game and this really kills the customization dramatically. Now i know that you can't get everything for free, but some of that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is like 5000$, which turns fun gameplay into a grind. It is incredible how much guns cost and the cheapest form of getting the better guns is to rent them for 10 days.....fun; not to forget that the tooltip at the bottom of the loading screen only tells me to buy more stuffz. Up next is the fr, i can run almost all my games at high quality and keep a steady fr, but this game manages to go from a steady fr to complete freeze and then back to normal i don't know if thats cause of my internet or not, but its really annoying. ( also i have the settings on max and alot of the textures are blurry). The last thing is the servers you can get into one pretty easily, but my god people are just bouncing around and freezeing up or 'rubber banding' I think is what it's called.  All and all this game had alot of potential as an awsome game. If this didn't have microtransactions and was a pay up front game it would be great, but the microtransactions, grinding, servers, and fr all ruin it for me just keep an eye out and maybe these guys will make a stand alone title. P.S Punk Buster......really....sigh...
3548	0	a	Infuriating game. It can actually be great fun, especially with friends. But not only is APB severely crippled by stupid game design, the engine is atrocious. Expect ridiculous lag making the game unplayable, crashes to desktop or even crashes that lock up your entire system. Support for this game seems nonexistent too - these problems have been going on for years now.
3549	0	a	this game is terrible
3550	0	a	on of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest free game ever made.dont waste your time here guyz 
3551	0	a	Used to be fun, it's simply a Money grabbing title now with hackers and 'wtf!?' moments every 5 minutes
3552	0	a	This game has a great idea, but just wrong developement of said idea. There are too many cheaters, and it is so pay to win.
3553	0	a	took to long to load
3554	0	a	What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is wrong with this game?!?!?!? When I get into a district, it takes years to load. Then I try to get out from the buliding, but the game has no response. And finally, when i find some car to steal, the game crashes. Everytime when I play it runs out of memory, and it still says on Steam that I am playing.  I won't play this game again.
3555	0	a	I downloaded this game hoping for it to be what I hoped GTA V online to be like (before the game came out). I was for sure, not let down when you were allowed to steal cars and use guns in this game. However, it being stricly online make sit impossible to learn unless everyone around you is also new to the game. In a game like GTA V you can practice in story mode then take your skills to the streets of Los Santos online. This game did not allow me to do that, leaving me terribly confused and irritated to say the least. Unless you're good with shooters like this, I do not recommend this game.
3556	0	a	In the basic a real nice game with a solid gameplay and good mechanics.  Also the mission design is great with a lots of varieties.  But... The progress in this game is rather difficult due to the overhelming 'buyable' content. I had a lot of fun playing this game, but in the end was frustrated as i get killed by players with weapons you can't unlock through simply playing this game.  This game could have great potential to be a really great f2p game, but the unbalanced content, also the frustration you will experience while playing against some players who take all the posible buyable benefits, negate all positive experience.   In the end i do not recommend this game, unless you are willing to spend some $$ for a faster/better armored car and a weapon which is more accurate and does more damage than the free counterpart.   My last opinion on this. If there would be no buyable content (cars/weapon) but only cosmetical content like clothes etc. This would be a great game as a f2p. Right now it's one of the most wicked pay 2 win games i played in the last months
3557	0	a	Poor game alot of lag questes marks are not on the map marken propely so this game i would give it a 4/10 very bad i dont think you should play this :l
3558	0	a	Even the login 'feature' doesn't work. That's quite an achievement.  Unplayable, literally.
3559	0	a	Wouldn't even let me play, kept telling me that the server was unavailable.
3560	0	a	Call of Duty meets Coips and Robbers. APB Reloaded looked great to me at first glance, and the trailer sold it for me. Then however......I started playing.  Don't get me wrong, this game does have a few good things that can be said about it. They actually put some work into a base storyline, that I feel could have done well if it's gameplay counterpart wasn't a pile of sh*t. 1. There really are nearly infinte amounts of customization options. If you're the kind of gamer who gets hot and bothered when you can change the shade of colours you never actually see, you'll be here a while.... 2. Aesthetics. The graphics in APB are pretty good, even above par in a few ways. The voice acting is also better than most I've heard. 3. Options. You can play the way you want. Maybe grab a rifle and sit on a rooftop, or climb in a van with your buds, grab some SMG's and have a good ol' fashioned drive-by.  But, the negatives are there as well, and I feel they seriously outdo the pros. 1. Free to Play.......Pay to Win. No matter how much In-game Cash you grind by doing missions and getting epic multi-kills, you can never actually buy a weapon. You rent them for a week......a week! One would think that this time limit would at least make the weapon worth your hard work right? Wrong. Shell out $20 real world and you can get a gun that takes the entire in game shop and blows it's face off.......forever. 2. Vehicles. Remember the drive-by I mentioned earlier? You might wanna forget that....because you can't call what you do in an APB vehicle driving. Every vehicle is slow and unresponsive, on average it takes a second before the vehicle will start turning the direction you told it to. And when it does turn, it's like being on a Canadian highway in December! 3. AI. I know handicapped people with better mechanics than this. Park your car in the middle of the road and the whole city is like a Sim avatar stuck behind a chair in the kitchen. 4. Matchmaking. This could be put in both pros and cons actually.... The matchmaking system is very intuitive. It matches players based on in game 'Threat-Level' The higher this level, the better. However, this only accounts for personal achievements. Say you win 30 matches back to back, rockin' your starter rifle. You'll get an impressive Threat-Level. But some chotch who wins some and loses some might get put in a lobby with you, and he paid for his loadout. You stand little chance and the sysytem has no clue.  There are probably more things I could say about APB Reloaded, but at this point....I'm ranting. And you probably didn't even read this far anyway.

3569	0	a	Fairfight is a joke. Cash shop gets more updates than the actual game. Promises of fixes and better gameplay yet servers act trashy randomly. GTAV might be better but good memories here, it is worth playing for a bit but unless you quit life and play non stop you will always get trashed on. Don't expect much with this game seriously.. 7/10
3570	0	a	I installed this game as soon it was released as free to play, but the game was pay to win from day one so I eventually stopped, and I'll explain why.  I understand that this game needs pay to win elements in order to recoup costs and generate revenue, but there is a universal line which the company has unfortunately crossed.  Pay to win items in this game include fast cars and premium firearms far deadlier than the stock firearms which otherwise would have taken days to weeks to earn, if at all. Not only that, all weapons are subscriptions that need to be renewed. That is the line that should never be crossed. Pay to win elements should never award any significant advantage over the default elements. If it does, the quality of gameplay is flushed down the toilet and it's not a real game anymore.  In summary, the only way to be good in this game is to buy the deadly premium weapons on which the company has unabashedly placed exorbitant pricing, and apparently most players do so every day. It is the only way to have any amount of fun in this game, unless you enjoy being unfairly DM'ed.  And this is from my experiences a few years ago, which I haven't written about at the time because the review system hadn't existed then, plus I haven't thought of writing one until now. The system hasn't changed, nor will it ever, because why would the company scrap the system that generates probably the majority of their dirty profit? Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this one game, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere to satisfy your daily cravings of online shooter fun.
3571	0	a	So I once had a good review of this game, but I have to change it I'm afraid.  I have well over 400 hours into the game (Played before it was on stea to track my hours) so I'm not someone coming in talking out of their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ angry about pay to win.  I have spent money on this game  I have earned a lot of the same stuff outside of spending money  I have leveled both a Crim and and Enf 1 max one close to it.    This game is a shell of its former self, and really there is no game like it still, but you should still look elsewhere. I won't scream hackers, because they've gotten good at banning them, but there are still a few cases where it is far past questionable, especially from the same few people that somehow stick around (I've played long enough to know good from hackker).  I won't say the game is entirely pay to win, and this is coming from someone who HAS paid into the game, but I will say it has gotten damn close, especially the past year. New guns come out that you can only buy, their are not great earning eqvuilanets, and the few that are in some cases can take you as many hours as I have into the game, not including mods, and making the money to rent them constantly.  It isn't a terrible game, but sadly it is run buy a company that seems more focused on their shop than their game. Still the same tired maps this many years later, still the same tired missions that get old and are easily exploitable if you know them well enough (some sides WILL easily win if they are defending/attackin for example). The company running this game seems to have given up on impleneting anything new into the game outside of guns they sell you with real money, and seem to have all but given up on the idea of expanding the game or adding content, which is sad. Game STILL has potentially, simply because no one else does this really, outside of GTA 5 online, but the devs need to realize they are running a game server, not a cash shop.
3572	0	a	Whoop de doo. I played this game before it came to steam, but I couldn't write a review because I hadn't played it on steam. Great.  So I installed it, started it up, shut it down and uninstalled it.  That's right, I never went to actually play it here in steam. Why? Because, if it's only half as bad as I remember, then you want to stay far away from this game.  Bad matchmaking, elitst jerks, hackers, money hungry developers, and much more. The company making it calls themselves ''gamersfirst''  ... Don't get me started. but hey, if you're filthy rich and don't know what to spend all your money on. This game is it.  I won't bother telling anything else, everyone who's given this game a thumbs down is summing it up pretty nicely.  It's too bad, really. I loved the concept, and I always enjoy character customizations with few limits. 
3573	0	a	the game is really fun but its ruined by how badly they want you to spend real money on the game. in order to get anything decent or cool you need to pay money for god damn points. you can only have 2 decals on your car if u want more u need to pay. character stuff u need to pay. f that. basically this game should be called money waster simulator. if they get rid of the money and make a way to get those stuff then 8/10.
3574	0	a	The most Pay 2 Win game ever created in Universe, if you like to be killed in 0,05 sec by a Player who bought premium weapons than this is your pick! Enjoy repetative missions while being called noob cause you didn't pay to win, unload 7 clips of ammo in to one guy who then kills you with 2 shots from a pistol. Only thing that is fine in the game is costumization options. This game is the worst crap ever ressurected to be a Money Milking Machine. Don't play this game.
3575	0	a	Tons of character variety. Fun PvP.  Downside? Falls into the Pay to win category, which just isn't for me.
3576	0	a	A great game with a super awesome amount of customization. However the pay-2-win model ruins most the game.

3582	0	a	Truely awful. You will just die, and die, and die by simply overpowered players that have put their money into the grind machine to quickly unlock the best possible weapons that will one shot you before you can blink. No tutorial that I noticed, and no match making, just thrown into a mess. Appalling game.
3583	0	a	I want to like this game. It has the potential to be fun. It's mechanics are great. The idea behind it amazing. But alas, it lacks the one thing any PVP game requires: Balance. It advertises a tutorial server that doesn't exist, so you're tossed into the thick of things to learn the game. It doesn't tell you controls, mission types, or anything of the sort, and the worst of it all is the utter lack of balance. A fresh off the boat character will be matched against gold level players wielding rocket launchers and LMG's that may as well be classified as ranged chainsaws. It's not newbie friendly at all, and it doesn't give you a chance to learn the game before putting you against people who live and breath the game. I can't recommend this, as much as I want to enjoy it.
3584	0	a	Repetitive, buggy, poorly balanced, and terribly optimized. I suggest taking a pass on this one.
3585	0	a	How do you play a game so rife with hackers and no regulatory system with regards to it? That negative point is enought to drown out almost all the positiveness in the game.
3586	0	a	my car looks cute my grill looks fresh my gun looks nice but this game is trash sometimes the truth doesn't rhyme
3587	0	a	worst game on Steam! The game has TONS of cheaters and noobs the game isnt fair ,the cops are over-powered  gamersfirst made the Premium accounts get alot more than the f2p users this game the biggest example for the worst game and pay 2 win game.  DONT DOWNLOAD IT
3588	0	a	Sure, this game is kinda cool in it's customization aspect but it falls behind in gameplay. This game is 'technically' not pay-to-win, as some would say, but to earn the benefits that paying players get would require countless hours of frustrating attempts to cope with this game.  The gameplay is pretty limited (eg. barely any building are actually accessible) and there are the little things that lower the games value, in my opinion (eg. ladders can only be climbed from the very bottom or the very top; if you are on top of a car next to a ladder, you can't climb the ladder, you must move the car and climb from the bottom.)
3589	0	a	On this game, you get to customize your character the way YOU want to, maybe not to specific but yo can get damn close, plus the Action in it is fun, just try and avoid the cheaters when possible  ***NEW NOTE*** over the years playing it now, i lost all taste in the game, its rather bad and just plain garbage, i regret spending money on this now other than to just customize my characters.
3590	0	a	hate it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3591	0	a	To put it bluntly. It's not a fun game. MMO's aren't my thing really, but this is just bad. To many different tabs, buttons, and overlay options to worry about. Plus, you can totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself over early game, by messing up 1 part of the intro.
3592	0	a	the only game i uninstalled within 1 day
3593	0	a	piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥       jk i've never played it i just have it xD
3594	0	a	I do not recommend this game. If you are beggner go do some misions some pro player will snipe you or kill u with rpg on sight. Best game i have ever uninstalled
3595	0	a	Meh... if you can afford a subscription, it's pretty neat.  
3596	0	a	I'll sum this game up for you in a few words, hacker infested pay-2-win garbage. 1/10 you WILL be disappointed @_@
3597	0	a	Now I can see that this game definitely had a lot of potential in the beginning, but the end product is a broken mess that is confusing, tedious, and repetitive. The major upside of this game is that the character customization is far superior to many other games. Other than that, there's hardly anything worth mentioning about this game. My advice: Don't waste your time, and certainly DON'T waste your money on this game.
3598	0	a	tbh this game is trash but if you like a toxic community just go on any of the apb servers. It would be a great game but in the past 4 years only 2 things in this game have changed for the better. And even with those changes this game is not worth a download. If you play apb quit and if you dont then dont even download it.
3599	0	a	The game is not bad but...  It is hyper casual; bullet drop/damage are completely silly. If you are looking for a tactical team based competative shooter with realism and skill continue your search or I recommend CS:GO. If you want to have fun screw around and just blow stuff up and play grand theft auto for free, this is your game.  The review may seem harsh but it isn't a bad game just know what you want from your games and play it!
3600	0	a	A bit laggy even with my newly built gaming computer, not a lot to do in this game either, honestly.
3601	0	a	You'll turn into my profile picture if you play this game.
3602	0	a	THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥TTTTTTTTTTT  I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ UNISTALLED AFTER PLAYING THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OMFG DONT DL  THIS IS A LOAD OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3603	0	a	I've played far too much of this game, and let me go ahead and tell you not to make the same mistake I did.  For the sake of new players or those interested without knowing, this game is effectively a PVP only game, everything that results in progression in the game is done through fighting other players of the opposite faction.  The game may see some improvement in the future, but as it stands, this game has so many problems with balance, stability, etc that it simply isnt enjoyable.  For the longest time, I've played this game dealing with what issues it has to enjoy the cornucopia of interesting features and customization that the game has, but all in all it isnt worth it. The servers are laggy constantly, skill level seems to not matter at all as far as player placement is concerned, and many players including myself are stricken with constant jerking and stuttering. Now I can't discredit the game too much for the stuttering, thats probably more on my end, but the game has more then enough problems aside from that for me to wholeheartedly tell you not to play this game.    Problem #1: 'Matchmaking'   Notice that matchmaking is in quotes, there is a reason for that. APB doesn't really have much of a matchmaking system to speak of. Players are allowed into and recommended to go to different instances of the games two districts based on their current skill rating, while the player's level is generally not factored into the allowance into a certain instance of a district. This at first seems like a relatively fair system, those who play better would soon be designated 'gold' skill level players that are allowed to play on gold and silver level districts. Gold players are absolutely abundant in this game, and this leads to one of two outcomes for any one given time, Either the gold servers are full, so all of the gold players are in low player skill designated districts,  OR  the gold servers are completely empty, and therefore none of the golds want to go there, so they still go to low skill districts. Now, this basically means that no matter where you are, what level you've achieved, or what skill level you may be, you're going to run into a bunch of golds. And more than likely, they'll destroy you. Now I know what some of you may be thinking 'Oh you're just a noob complaining about getting owned by other players, stop whining and get better at the game.' And while I will admit I am not the best of players, take this into account: I normally hover around silver skill level, this means that I can access pretty much every level of server, if I feel ballsy enough I can go to a gold district, I can stay in silver (filled mostly with golds) or I can go to bronze with lower skilled players. Being silver and not wanting to fight all of the gold players who all are extremely high ranked and all seem to have a rocket launcher pointed directly at your face, I started to play on the bronze districts. When in a bronze district one of two things happened, I either encountered bronze players and my fellow silvers and had a relatively balanced match, with fair fighting, good play on each side, and everybody had a decent amount of fun, OR I had a team full of bronze players and was matched against a team with 4 out of 5 players being gold. Now, gold players arent generally allowed on bronze servers, but thats the thing, if you purposefully lose enough to get yourself to silver you can go right in, win once or twice and get your gold back, and proceed to stay in the surver murdering everyone.    Problem #2: Threat Levels.   Now your threat rating generally is supposed to tell other players how skilled you are, its a general measurement of your wins over losses etc, now this could be considered only measuring skill, more often than not however gold players have weapons that were purchased within the games cash shop, which are fully modded, and just monumentally better than anything you could get with in game currency even relatively later in the game. This means that for many players, the only reason they've achieved a gold rating is because of superior equipment. Now don't get me wrong, the game is not entirely pay to win, you have just as much opportunity to destroy people with guns purchased with in game currency, many of the high level guns and modifications are equally effective if not moreso than the guns one can purchase with real money, but the problem is that all of these gold players stepping all over your play space makes it extremely difficult to progress at all. If you're constantly losing to gold players with fancy weaponry then you arent going to progress far enough to get the weapons that supposedly make the game's cash shop 'balanced.' So basically, 80% of the time or more, any gold you see is only gold because he has a shiny gun he bought for 10 bucks. Some people get there the hard way, but its alot easier when you get great weapons at the get go.    Problem #3: The Cash Shop.   Now, while the cash shop is of course necessary for the game to EXIST due to it being free to play, its also the reason that the game is so damn difficult for anyone who chooses (or simply can't) pay. The problem here is that the game is entirely player vs player. You can't really say that a normal MMORPG that is heavily reliant on player purchases for player success is truly pay to win, because you still have the option of playing the game without conflict in order to reach the goal of power, but in this case, pvp IS the game. You PvP, its what you do. The cash shop gives players the opportunity to buy fancy customization, clothing, cars, gun skins, you name it its there, but it also has straight up weaponry available. If you so choose you can enter the game, and without having done anything, buy a gun who's statistics are on par with a gun that would take hours upon hours upon HOURS of someone who isnt paying for a premium subscription to achieve, and not just because of the cost, but because of the fact that you have to unlock them before purchase. This means that everyone who has bought a gun has an immediate advantage over everyone else, while this may not be very detrimental to a game with more of a PVE focus, this game is ,as I have said far too many times at this point, purely pvp. This means that every person that has bought a gun is not only making the game easier for them to play, but it is hindering the possibility to actually progress through the game for others. If other words, if all I can fight are people with fully modded guns, and I'm say, a level 20 bronze player, then I wont be able to level up very quickly at all, wont be able to get any kills to progress the games statistic based weapon unlock systems for certain guns, and therefore basically can't play the game effectively lest I pay to buy those same guns.    And Now for some less connected problems.      Problem #4: Server issues    This game has had some of the WORST server performance I have ever seen. With sometimes constant rubberbanding, lag, and general connection issues, it can make the game a downright pain to handle.  To be honest, I used to love this game, even with some of the flaws it had and still has. The guns are fairly interesting, the cars handle uniquely, the customization is one of the game's strong points being one of the BEST customization systems that you can experience in a video game, and even the quirky limitations of the game, such as the lack of head shots or any articulation based hitboxes (everyone has one, uniformly sized hitbox). But to be honest, without paying a metric â™¥â™¥â™¥-ton of money, you are severely limited by the players who do. The community is awful as well, with hack accusations being dropped like raindrops in a storm.  The game just isnt worth it in the long run for the amount of crap you have to go through to get anywhere.  Maybe someday. Maybe someday.
3604	0	a	To many hackers
3605	0	a	Not really into it, played for an hour got bored cause I have no idea what I'm doing
3606	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
3607	0	a	Come here if you like customization. The gameplay will make you rage, though. The game likes to pair you up against higher levels and/or people with paid subs. Both have better weapons than you and will kill you faster.
3608	0	a	I try and play it and my computer says that it's already running when it's not
3609	0	a	this game was bad when it came out and it still is. too bad, good idea, just done horribly.
3610	0	a	I dont like it i cant get it to work after i download it so i guess i'll just get back to playing star trek online or find another open world free to play game thanks but no thanks
3611	0	a	Game has micro transactions. I get thats its free, but microtransactions are the only way to play the game? Really? 
3612	0	a	a peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that doesent even load up
3613	0	a	i was playing a hour early and i went to get food i come back on and it sayed i was banned for no reason i did nothing to get this no hack not even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ player off so how do i get banned for nothing and it is now one hour later gamerfirst i will not get any more of your games
3614	0	a	Going into APB Reloaded, I expected an alternative to GTA. One that had many traits that made GTA so successful. If you've ever played any of the GTA titles, you know what I mean. Anyways, this game is a very big download, so please, be prepared to wait. Once the game finally launched, you decide which faction you'd like to be apart of. Criminals, or Law Enforcement.   Each is unique in it's own way. The character creation is extremely in-depth, I'll give the game that.   But the main question is, is this game a good alternative to GTA? In my opinion, no. The game takes way to long to load, around 6-10 minutes EVERY time. The story line is hard to understand, and the game is very much Pay-to-win. You can tell within the first 15 minutes of playing the game. The game is NOT newb-friendly. In missions, if you are a low-level it is extremely hard to find a group that wont kick you out. You can't use planes, boats, ships, or anything for that matter. The only thing you can do, is hijack cars.  The ONLY joy I had in this game was hijacking cars, and shot random civilians. Which is one shot, instant kill. No matter what. It takes forever to become wanted by the police, and when you are, a big clash ensumes. Awsome right? Nah. I crashed every time I entered a deathmatch.  Overall: 5/10: Don't get this game.  Sum-up: A very limited, stripped down, version of GTA.
3615	0	a	This game has the potential to be awesome but it sucks on so many levels. First off it is a massive grind, you have to invest a substantial amount of time into it to be able to unlock anything at all, even if you pay the monthly fee to increase your rates. On top of that you have a broken weapon system that leaves every weapon with an unrealistic niche forcing you to buy a ton of weapons to be able to fight in different areas of the map otherwise the guy with the weapon better tailored for that alleyway or that elevated highway is going to win regardless of how good he/you are.   The biggest flaw however is the ranking system in this game. It is absolutly impossible to play this game as a new player and have a decent time learning the game because the tiered ranking system apparently plays no role whatsoever in matchmaking. There are servers tiered for each rank on the list, but they are not locked for that rank so someone well beyond your skill level as judged by the game can join your server and will get matched against you in the matchmaking system every... single... game. It just isn't fun getting destroyed mission after mission by female avatars in knee stockings and miniskirts, or flat naked who have hours upon hours more invested in the game to unlock all of the guns and perks and cars and whatever else.   Game sucks, do yourself a favor and go get just cause 2 if you want a freeform driving multiplayer game, or world of warcraft if you want to spend hours of your life doing the same repetative â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for hours on end to raise up in level.
3616	0	a	this game you cant even open i dont recommend it 
3617	0	a	this is a good game which reminds me of the game gta . it is good but u will need to spend real mony to get permanent stuff. so i dont recommend this game at all. 
3618	0	a	ive found someone who's played nearly 3000 hours of this game  i would have killed myself
3619	0	a	Gameplay is good, honestly. Lots of customization, etc. The real problem is the game is unplayable. It has seriously terrible lag spikes and makes the game is so hard to play with. Lots of players complained about this. If they fix the lag spikes, improve something heavy on the game or even make game changes, it maybe could be better.
3620	0	a	so I'll play the game wtih no problems what so ever. then i'll try to play it again and it'll say that a file is missing and the game can't start. i fun when i can actually play it, but because of this problem, i do not recomend this game until there is a fix.
3621	0	a	The loading takes so long and the updates are terrible. Control scheme is horrible and even on high graphics isn't the most good looking of games. Also Gameplay is not really that fun and the Character Creation is horrible and sometimes not fuctioning proberly. You might as well get money in your steam wallet and buy any of the GTA's out there.
3622	0	a	Honestly, APB: Reloaded itself is great and fun. The game type is entirely unique, in that it's basically criminal gangsters versus lawful gangsters (Criminals vs Enforcers), destroying the city through random missions and the robbery of citizens' belongings by means of ram-raiding shop windows or mugging them on the street. The open world instances are flashy and fun to look at and explore, even if the majority of buildings can't be entered. The game's customization is, and maybe always will be, the best of its class -- if there even is another in that glorious top-tier -- simply because you can make your own theme songs, decals, and more through the in-game editors. Even if you aren't very good at art, you can still enjoy the simplicity of the game's customization, and make complex designs very easily.  The reason I don't recommend this game is because of the company that presently owns it: GamersFirst. Whatever good content they can add is made worthless by one of two means: The slow ranking system, or the simple fact that it's exclusive to the cash shop, making it one of the largest pay-to-wins I've ever played. There's also the major problem of cheaters/hackers, and the terrible security that's presently implemented. Still, I found a way to look past all of that and enjoy the game for about a year, even if the servers rubber-banded every now and then. Unfortunately, that rubber-banding has gotten worse over time, as the servers are simply getting more and more degraded by the second. GamersFirst is incapable of understanding that they need to upgrade these servers, and now the game is in a state where every movement has a 5-second delay, rubber-banding runs rampant, and disconnections occur every 5-10 minutes which won't allow you back on for another 20. GamersFirst does not understand the real ideas behind running a good game besides content, and in that they have ruined the experience of the game completely.  This is not the first good concept they've destroyed. WarRock is another shooter that now belongs to Nexon Europe, and once belonged to GamersFirst. The vehicles in the game are solid, and plays like a free-to-play Battlefield, in its own way. When my friends first told me about WarRock, the first thing they warned me to avoid was the public servers. I asked why and they gave me one answer: hackers. By the time I got that warning, though, I had already joined a public server and saw a flying tank getting destroyed by a glitched helicopter. I quickly left, and played in a private room with my friends, having a great time until the servers suddenly went down. They didn't come back up within half an hour, and we all decided to uninstall the game shortly after.   It saddens me that APB has been ruined by such a terrible company, to the point where I can no longer recommend it. I've heard rumors that Perfect World Entertainment is looking into buying APB: Reloaded from GamersFirst, and I must say that sounds like a far better idea than letting it run on the slowly melting servers it's running on now.
3623	0	a	play gta v its way better
3624	0	a	how come this game does not work on windows 8 
3625	0	a	This game was with unique idea, super good customization and etc it was perfect, but then, like it always happens - cheaters and hackers come. The game is ruined now.
3626	0	a	worst game ever 0/10 would not furfunkle
3627	0	a	this game always crash on me this game is suck â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3628	0	a	my game simply just wont load up :/
3629	0	a	Interesting gam concept. Deemedlike it would be a lot of fun. But Laggy gameplay coupled with either incompetent or malicious teammates made the game unplayable for me.
3630	0	a	Okay, don't get me wrong here - the idea of a modern-city shooter with free-roaming missions and constant PvP is not bad at all. However, there are some serious problems with this game.  The fact that the vehicles have clunky controls I could stand. The way the missions are handled I could stand.  But the system requirements are absolutely RIDICULOUS. You basically need a top-end system to get any usable framerate out of this game. Any less, and you'll have 10-second pauses in any sort of loading - which is inexcusable with this type of gameplay.
3631	0	a	Not only did I have trouble getting the game to open, when it did I was presented with a credits screen and then a black screen that persisted for over five minutes. I couldn't alt-tab out of it, my task manager wouldn't open from it, and it wouldn't close via right-click on the task bar so I had to reboot my computer. Immediately uninstalling this defunk software.
3632	0	a	2/10 wouldn't recomend to a dead person, eats the liveing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of your ram if not then their is almost always a memory leakage for non 64bit systems &amp; microtransactions around every corner almost everyone is either a hacker, glitch exploiter or paid a ton of money for anything as useless as a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ stain on their shoes, would rarther rip my balls off and play call of duty 4 with a lobby full of prepubescent 9 yearolds.
3633	0	a	it would be nice if i could actually play the game, when i try to start it, all it says is that the game wasnt properly installed.
3634	0	a	if you seriously like this game there is something wrong with you lmao
3635	0	a	Great now with the new anti-cheat system. Still abit to laggy tho but cannot complain WAY better than a year ago.

3638	0	a	Horrible game didn't even install correctly. It wanted me to install physx which i did then it told me to restart my computer which i also did and it still didn't work. I uninstalled it and will never even touch this game with a 10 foot pole.
3639	0	a	GamersFirst is a terrible moneygrabbing company. Despite APB:Reloaded having fun gameplay and a good somewhat worthwhile (and repetetive) experience it is a 'Pay to Win' multiplayer game, where the more money you put into it the more you'll be favoured in-game. Be warned, if you do decide to pay to win, they can and most likely will take your privelages away with a delicious ban, it happened to the infamous me, twice.   Play this game at your own risk, feel free to play it even more when it's taken over by a different company that's somewhat more involved with their community.
3640	0	a	A game with great potential, ruined by what only can be described as incompetent developers. This game is mechanically unbalanced and unintentionally designed to bring out the worst in people, and despite the crappy engine the game is built upon that would prevent quick changes on larger scale issues, the game still commits simple game design sins, the biggest one being selling mechanics as premium items.  This is the ONE THING YOU DONT DO IN A F2P GAME, it's the quickest way to unbalance the game beyond the developers control, and the prices in the store are beyond extortionate and exploitative. Despite the various lead developers and community managers that move in and out of the company (which really makes you wonder what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is going on), apparently no-one collectively sees this as enough of an issue to fix.  It's sad then that it's still the MMO i've played for the most time, but to be honest im hoping now that another much more intelligent developer will make something that encapsulates the brilliance of this games concept and actually be able to make it good, as i've given up on hoping Reloaded Games recognises these elements as actual problems.
3641	0	a	3 Words can discribe this game Pay 2 Win.. No really it's a P2W game and the weapons they sell are extreamly expensive and as far as I can tell the Devs favor on the Criminal side duo to some seriouse unbalance LTL weapons that take 8 hits just to stun a person but it takes 3 hits with a normal weapon to kill you seems a little on the BS side if you tell me. I would not bother downloading the game
3642	0	a	PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME !!!! This game was really bad, i think this game same like GTA. But, this game just like trash with big size on my PC. And also, the customize characters doesnt like Saints Row. And I really hated about lag connection.
3643	0	a	Was terrible. My Computer is waayyyyyy beyond reccomended specs and I have good internet too. Is nothing like it says it is. Completely pointless
3644	0	a	This game sucks. The only way to get anywhere is to pay money for premuim. there is also to many hackers.
3645	0	a	p2w but good balance for being a free2play game.
3646	0	a	Peace of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on  stream.Rly i dowload the game here and it says error??!?!But when i dowload it from the original site it works??
3647	0	a	I hate this game. This game sucks and take a long time to download also. 0/10
3648	0	a	Worst game ever unless you got a big wallet! DONT PLAY IT!
3649	0	a	Okay,at first i kinda liked it but suddently i was doing a mission with the starter guns and they aren't half bad,real ammount of bullets for its real version is really close exept the snipers and M4s just 1 shotting every car in the game: gun balance extremely bad i get dominated by five-sevens  do not reccomend this game to anyone (exept hackers)
3650	0	a	I absolutely hated this game. I was put up against players that were way ahead of me right when i started. How am i supposed to progress through the game if i can't even get a kill? Fix that issue and maybe i'll decide to play it again, but in the meantime, don't expect me to play this game at all.
3651	0	a	This game is allright, you know fun to play with a group of friends (not so much solo) but thats down to your own play style, this game is obviously still updating and getting better and better but most people wont enjoy this game for many reasons  - Hackers (they still exist in the game and there isn't anything really being done to get rid of them, even punkbuster is doing a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ job) and when the hacker eventually gets banned a new one is born, so it's a never ending cycle and I mean if you always get put against a hacker, yes you can be lucky and own a hacker since most hackers are complete and utter idiots so it's easy but most of the time it's just dam impossible to play the game when there are â™¥â™¥â™¥ bugs like this running around using wallhack, aimbot etc etc.  - Lag - This is still an issue today server lag is too dam high and it's annyoing kind of spoils the game really when people or yourself are warping around like a little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so it can be frustrating, there is talk about them upgrading their servers at somepoint but even then I don't think it will be any time soon we have nice running smooth servers, it's a pile of wank  - Glitch spots - you have the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in this game that like to exploit the games princibles by putting the item in a stupid to get location or an OP spot, this too is a game spoiler as it ruins the fun when the ennemy oposition are just camping like little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es, this gets â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing annoying and pisses me off, so it eventually turns you bronze. It's stupid and G1 need to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing do something about these stupid locations  There are many other reasons why this game is total crap, but the game also have good parts, fun to play etc but it does get boring eventually and hackers/lameidiots just makes the game boring.  GamersFirst make enough money from Armas Marketplace yet they just don't do anything good about it, rather than fixing the easy, obvious to fix issues they'd rather create more crap to put on the marketplace for people to buy, fix the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game already but yea, I don't recomment this game especially since you have to start from the bottom and work up, with idiots on this game your just going to get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on.
3652	0	a	Totally waste of time... Free to Play games should be banned from Steam....grinding and money draining as we are going to work to be ripped off whilst spending some time with our hobby! If you want do do a favour to yourself leave F2P games to old people on Mobile Phones!

3654	0	a	This game is terrible, when you try to do missions you get killed by people 50 times higer the level you are and they camp at the objectives. This game is not for new players or people who HATE grinding.   -50/10
3655	0	a	Worst game ever 1st lagg 2 errors don't play it we just want to fix the dam laggg in the server is that so hard !!!!!!!!!!

3660	0	a	it wasted 1 hour of my life
3661	0	a	Only thing I LOVE about this game is the custome tatoos, shirts, and cars, however, in order to gain full access to customization tools, you need to pay real money to unlock more layers...wtf! That is just a bumer for me, still manage to get some nice logos done. After the customization side of this game, it's pretty bad. It's pretty much GTA Online for F2P. It's call F2P, but those who spent real cash has a giant advantage over those who don't. Good weapons are all really high rank and requires a lot of grinding to get. This game is not beginner friendly at all.
3662	0	a	Alot of potential but awful implementation.  The gameplay is quite fun if you get matched against an even team but machmaking is quite bad in this game it will match you up against higher lvl player again and again wich can be frustrating as hell.  Also the higer lvl weapons are quite a bit better so if your medium to low lvl the frustration can be too mutch. as your against more experienced players that know every nook and cranny but they also outgear you in weapons armor and equipment.  Also the ingame store is the saddest thing i have seen in my life it wil cost you euro`s to rent a bloody gun yes RENT wtf and as most guns are reskins of current guns your paying rent for a skin. But the store is the only way to get acces to higher lvl weapons so yes you can get most stuff ingame it wil take you 200+ hours to get to the good stuff or payup.  Also all the long range guns are way too powerfull an ak like gun does +- 160ish damage the most used sniper in the game does 950 so there are so many that even use it as a close combat shotgun.  Dont even get me started about grenade spam higher lvl`s even get to carry 3 grenades that do way to much damage.  Also this game reward cheesy gameplay as the losing team almost gets no XP, so expect every dirty trick/glitch people know against you.  And last but not least so many cheaters and i consider every change to the gamefile`s a cheat like the widely used tweaks to remove all the textures and shader adjustments to remove smoke, add outlines all so its easyer to spot people. adjusting crosshairs so they have one even if they are running.  and ofc the people with aimbots and stuff.  GamersFirst the company that runs the game has added almost noting since the game came out years ago in reality they should be called myBankaccountFirst.  on the positve side i wish all games had this degree of custumising your looks
3663	0	a	just â™¥â™¥â™¥ this thing
3664	0	a	Crashes to much as soon as I get in game  
3665	0	a	even though i match the minimum requirement for playing, i still cant launch the game from the launcher without getting an error and my computer sounding like its about to explode.
3666	0	a	Fails to load Constantly
3667	0	a	WTF IS THIS GAME ITS PAY TO WIN HARD TO SHOOT HARD TO DRIVE LIKE OMG THIS GAMWE IS SDHITTY I SUGGEST YOU DONT EVEN MOVE YOUR MOUSE NEAR THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DOWNLOAD BUTTON IF YOU CLICK IT IT WILL DOWNLOAD A CANCER GAME 
3668	0	a	I used to love this game when I didn't have many games to play, but after going back to it I have noticed how glitchy and also how extremely pay 2 win this game is. Also, it'd be wrong to call this game 'GTA online' but it has a lot of potential and I did enjoy this game a lot playing till midnight with mates on Skype.   But to sum it up, the game simply has reached a dead end, the playerbase is basically dead and the gliches and P2W aspects are just stupid.
3669	0	a	Most broken game i have played!  performance is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, uses ages to load anything, have to use 48x AA to fully use the gpu, and you're stuck with 75 fps the pvp is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t as mission makes you face people with rpg's that instakill you or snipers while new players are stuck with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ assault rifles and a pistol with barely any damage.
3670	0	a	This is by far the worst community I've experienced in twenty years of gaming. This game attracts the lowest common denominator of every other game. Beyond the community, it's barely functional and runs horribly even on great machines. The engine update was promised for Q1 2014, yet it still hasn't happened. It can be fun at times, and it is a great idea for a game. However, the execution is extremely poor. I would not recommend this one.
3671	0	a	Now I dont have 1000 hours plus in this game like some people here but Ive seen enough to make a fair verdict. As a noob its hard to pick up like most games. But in order to combat the higher ranking played s you either must get MLG or pay 40 bucks for a weapon. (real moeny) You could buy the weapon for a few days but then after that your screwed. I am no means good at the game but I'd like to think Im more of a novice as I was ranked silver 2 I believe? (This is actualy decent in this game not like CSGO) The whole conecpt is pretty cool and the customization amazing. But the whole combat and progression system is really hard to get used to. If anyone has anything to say about my verdict (like my opion matters) please tell me, am I just bad? am I using the wrong guns? Or am I just doing everything wrong? But for now, this game needs some serious balancing issues.
3672	0	a	Boring
3673	0	a	No.i refuse to waste my time talking about this game.now go away and pirate a copy of another open-world game
3674	0	a	I CANT PLAY THE GAME I HAVE A 64 BIT AND IT DOESN'T ALLOW 64 BIT TO PLAY THE GAME AND WHEN I LAUNCH THE GAME IT SAYS MY VIDEO CARD IS INVALID
3675	0	a	i use to think this was alright, but now i cant even load up the game
3676	0	a	Doesnt even launch.Best piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on steam.
3677	0	a	The Devs are bunch of trolls... I'm done with this game. Give us the new Engine as you've promised years ago!! So Not Recommending this trash game. Don't play it... Spent your valuable time to somewhere else guys. You're welcome.
3678	0	a	This may have differed now, but when I played this game, the landscape was a barren wasteland with nobody in it. (Not literally a wasteland) Also, it was hard as hell to find things to do but roam around. Half the time you would just be getting shot by other players and they are way better than you, so you can't do anything about it. It is also a GTA Clone. And by Barren I meant there were no NPC's you could ever find 2.3/10 -Wasn't Very Fun
3679	0	a	I dont have that many hours put into APB when I wrote this review. But from the time I've played APB at the lowest graphic settings and with 20 FPS I currently think its a decent game. It IS ONE OF THE FEW games that allow you to customize the absolute hell out of you and your cars. The combat system is OK, although infinite stamina isnt that realistic. 'Headshots' do the same damage on your head and your foot, which disables headshot instakills, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Now about the buying system in APB. You buy a guy in the game, a decent gun. Do you have it? Yes, for 10 days. ARMAS marktplace, you can buy quite a lot of decent and nice stuff. Like nice packs which can include clothes, weapons, attachments, modifications, vehicles and emotes. BUT the best guns in the game you HAVE to buy with REAL money. Which makes this game lean even more to a P2W. Now if they were to put the best guns and every gun in the in-game shop which you buy with your well earned in-game money AND make them last FOREVER and not for only 10 days. I mean, you dont buy a car IRL to drive 10 days with it and then bring it back to the car dealer, do you? You dont go to the mall to buy some bread, eat it, then crap it out and then bring it back to the mall, do you?  I would give this game a rating of 6.5/10. It has amazing customization, an interesting server setup and a free-roam to mission 'map' but the developers are greedy, very very very very greedy. They want you to BUY somewhat EVERYTHING in the game to keep it FOREVER. Thats not how it works. Not at all.
3680	0	a	this game. issue after issue. so, first off. after opening it the 2nd time. the launcher was scanning. infinitely. for god knows what. after disabling IPv6 protocol, it worked. but when i tried to launch game. it did absolutely nothing. well, it opened chrome tab, 'like us on facebook to get 1 day free premium' (big whoop one god damn day..) after pressing launch AGAIN. it opened a splash screen. then opened another one. after leaving it like this for couple mins. nothing. so far, from my experience. this game. not worth 1 hr of downloading. (5GB from steam, then came with 500MB update from launcher, which only downloaded at 25-50% of my max download limit..)  (as i havent been able to play this game yet. dont take in consideration of my 'do you recomend this game' as u may not experience this issues like i have.)
3681	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.
3682	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.
3683	0	a	Although there are some stuff that makes it good, there are many things that make it really bad, outweighing the good. Where noobies (people who just start) are paired up with people who are much higher level than them, giving them a huge weapon/money disadvantage. And also the one thing I hate the most, the 'pay to win' aspect, where most of the uber items are only obtained if you pay for the game, by microtransactions, or any other way where you must pay to get items that can only be obtained by paying for it. Its ok to pay for items, as long as it doesn't break the game (Hats in TF2/ Vanity items). But if its 'Hey I want this uber weapon that dominates all other weapons that you can get by ingame currency' then it breaks the game.
3684	0	a	this game keeps on crashing and hanging i do not recommend it
3685	0	a	i hate this game
3686	0	a	this games balancing is the worst of any ive ever played
3687	0	a	watch for tracking cookies on this download
3688	0	a	no its crap and wont let me play it after about 2 hours of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ farting around go spend 20 bucks and get gta 1 you will have more fun
3689	0	a	This game is broken and it's getting more broke with every update. Admins ban anyone they want no matter what they did. The lag is apsolutely amazing. If you get frustrated very easily DON'T GET THIS GAME. On the other hand the game is very original and if it wasn't in the uncapable hands of gaymers first maybe it would have been an awesome game!
3690	0	a	APB Reloaded is not a very good game for a few reasons.  One: driving. Driving in this game is a chore. The streets must be made of solid sheets of ice, because cars slide around on turns. They're very hard to control, especially for beginners.  Two: unfair advantages. This game features microtransactions, which, when done properly, are not a problem at all. APB does it wrong. The more expensive guns are clearly better than others, putting inexperienced players or those who don't want to spend money on this game at a severe disadvantage to those who do. There is also no skill match mechanic, meaning that new players have a chance at going up against top-level players much of the time. This quickly leads to much frustration at not being able to do anything. For the new player, the only way to advance is to get lucky, which is not a good first impression.  Three: the game constantly pushes these purchases on you. If I wanted to buy something from this game, I would visit the marketplace myself. You don't need to constantly remind me that something's on sale. If I cared enough, I would check the sales out myself.  Four: the gameplay itself. Gameplay is unbalanced and frustrating, leading to much confusion for the new player. Objectives are hard to find, and the instructions vague at best. Rest assured most of it involves killing.  There is only one possibly redeeming quality about this game, and that is that there are good customization options for your character. This is dragged down by the fact that to get these customization options, you need money, which is earned by either trudging through the impossible missions or buying currency.  All in all, this game is only playable if you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars on it, and even then, it's mediocre at best. This game left a bad taste in my mouth, and you can be sure I won't be coming back for another bite.
3691	0	a	Tried it for a wekend. Incredibly dull. Not recommended.
3692	0	a	boring game , cheap gta rip off
3693	0	a	Cool Graphics but it's bad game and very laggy !
3694	0	a	Just as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as the first time this game came out.
3695	0	a	Laggy, kicks you off of your server up to 15 times an hour, waste of space unless you have a VERY fast computer.
3696	0	a	Menus are messy, quests are hard, very pay to win, and hard to understand what youre doing.
3697	0	a	Wouldn't let me play had to create an account on a third party site.
3698	0	a	I have not yet got to play this game , However it states that i have played for 89 mins. untrue I can not even get into it and i have loged in iI have created and regiestered but have yet to play the damed game what the hell is it. I am taking every thing out of my laptop now and forgetting I even tried this god awlful game bye bye
3699	0	a	WAAAAY back in the day I was picked to alpha test this game. The entire community of testers told the Devs time and again that they needed to add things to APB other than pure PvP for the game to work. Unfortunately, they never listened to their potential customers, the game did terribly, and the original devs ended up closing shop because of it! Now that it's been out for a while on the F2P market I figured I would give it a try, to see if the game has matured into something other than what it used to be. Sadly, nothing has been changed. The same glitches are in the game, and even with a &lt;60 ping latency the server still bugs out when there's a lot of people in one place.   If all you're interested in is running and gunning against other players then have at it, otherwise I would recommend other games like The Secret World that are on the F2P market.
3700	0	a	This game has SO MUCH POTENTIAL. But unfortunately, GamersFirst, or as many like to call them, CashFirst, Moneyfirst, or Gamers' Wallets First, have pretty much destroyed what they game could be. The way the system works give anybody who is willing to borrow their mom's credit card and pay for Premium will have an advantage so massivly unfair that it makes me wonder why they bothered even making it F2P when the F2P users get so royally screwed.  Call me a cheapskate, but I am a person who will pay any initial fee, but I will NEVER pay extra fees if possible. At the time this was written, I was a college student who is, go figure, dirt poor. APB: Reloaded is so much fun to play, but unfortunately, when teamed against people who have payed for extra perks, you can expect to rip out more than half your hair by the end of the round.  The game offers MASSIVE amounts of customization through the wide variety of players you can generate, and the decals you can create to decorate your outfit, car, and more. Though Premium players get much more than Free players. This I can understand, as if somebody wants to pay extra for aesthetic purposes, good on them! However, what you can buy weapon wise tips the game excessively in your favor, making it pointless to really play it if you don't have the money to.
3701	0	a	Terrible. Game won't start 75% of the time. Errors...  Other then all that its goofy, Full of hackers, and everything cool or useful cost USD.
3702	0	a	Why wont the game load for me?
3703	0	a	Game controls are Saints Row II awkward, and community is full of bitter people. Not trolls trying to be funny, just bitter people.
3704	0	a	WOW, You name the hack, here it is.. shocking amount of cheating, And high lvl VIP coming into servers just to blow you away Most likley because they are bored!! I gave it every chance and tried to ignore the warning`s posted by other`s and give this a go..OMFG!! be warned DO NOT DO THE SAME.. I promise you, I deplore you not to download this game.. Unless you have every intent on hacking like most in this game.. then join with your hacking brothers!! Such a shame has great potential, But clearly made to make a few quid and close this one down like they did the first!! Cant give this a lower thumbs down if i tried 100% thumbs down!!
3705	0	a	A great Game!!! But not really much fun for Free to Play People. There are to much Bonuses for others. Not well balanced. But the Gameplay and Concept is a Plus to look at it closer. Free to play Titel 6/10.
3706	0	a	This game dont have something what destroy this game -this game dont have good match making so you will se 50,49,85 versus 245,200,180 
3707	0	a	The only fun this game is for screwing around on a terrible gta clone.
3708	0	a	Really, really boring. repetitive. and above all, just annoying.
3709	0	a	I can see why this game flopped. WAY WAY too much learning curve and some apallingly bad design decisions make this a tough game to get into. Not for the weak of heart or short of time. NOT a casual game by any stretch of the imagination. I'd suggest staying away unless you have tons of time to burn.
3710	0	a	Imbalanced Pay2Win game with a lot of potential, only pay when you have the cash to invest! If you really do it can be loads of fun, watch out for griefers though.
3711	0	a	Wasn't that entertaining.
3712	0	a	It's bad. Just that.
3713	0	a	Much of the UI for character creation work sporadically at best. You get dumped in at a spawn point with no idea what to do. My spawn point was/appeared to be a bank. Peopl ran in and started shooting and I couldn't tell who was on what side. Makes a game with two factions difficult when you don't know what side the players are on.
3714	0	a	game needs balance. ex) every bronze sever in high levelers. the goldgun code is spread. aim haker in game.  and sever is insecurity. ex) sever shutdown without notice to steam users. asia users only have high ping(150ms+).  
3715	0	a	I would not recommend this game. If you're not willing to cough up the money, then the game isn't that fun. As either a Criminal or an Enforcer, you get mauled by others before you even get a chance to try to learn how to play. If you're new, then no one wants you. For me, probably because of my location from the server, it lags. This has a big impact. If it lags even a tiny bit, and makes it so you can't aim straight, or drive the car correctly, let's just say, 'It's not fun.' So, unless you don't have any lag at all, you can pick up how to play in the first few minutes, and you're willing to cough up the cash or barely get anywhere, then all the luck to you.
3716	0	a	This game is P2W... No match balancing system so if your new and you start, you'll get matched with rank 1-200... most people are donators with 1 shot snipers etc... The makers who made this really dont know how to make a good game.... its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ terrible
3717	0	a	Not great in my personal opinion. Hard to drive and when I went on I couldn't find anyone else. It's free, but there isn't any other reason than that why I would play this. And consequently, I dont.
3718	0	a	May just be me, but I feel there is a high Pay2Win issue with this game. Nice idea, but I feel like everyone can plow you over.
3719	0	a	Well, this should be nice, but it's not working on Windows 7 64 bit...
3720	0	a	Quite the emptiest servers I have ever seen.
3721	0	a	This game gave me cancer. It is simply awful. I do NOT recommend it.
3722	0	a	Horrible laggy and hard to set controls for motionjoy the regular is ok but need some work
3723	0	a	This is the WORST 3rd person shooter I have ever played! It is extremely unbalanced, A LOT OF LAG, and its structured into a PAY TO WIN game DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME IN THIS GAME!
3724	0	a	getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed by punkbuster so for i hate the game , waste of my time not GOOD
3725	0	a	Game is okay.... And that's being generous. That being said, the worst part of APB Reloaded is that it's pretty much pay-to-win. That is, a supposedly free-to-play game having players pay real money to get the most out of the game.
3726	0	a	When I saw the trailers, I thought that this is going to be epic game. But the truth is, that it is not. It has some good features, like breaking into a store throught the shop window with a car or the possibility of editing your character's appearance. But to be honest, you can't stand a chance in most of the PVP actions, since there are always players with special items from the store, that you can buy for real money.   So for me, it's a NO, when someone asks me about the game.
3727	0	a	it is not bad
3728	0	a	I so dont like it, its boring and horrible your better of Playing 8BitMMO
3729	0	a	awkward car controls, heavy system requirements, high ping.... seriously, stay away from this game unless you want to waste time ==
3730	0	a	sucks so hard I bothered writing this
3731	0	a	Populated with 12 year olds and pay to win. Don't even bother.
3732	0	a	Terrible game with terrible shooting mechanics.
3733	0	a	Don't bother wasting any time much less any money with this game. Gameplay is mostly repetitive and frustrating, and the city itself feels lifeless and bland apart from the players.   Can be be fun for a short time if you're with friends, but even then the shoddy gameplay mechanics get in the way of anything but a game of Quack! Quack!
3734	0	a	When I first started playing this game, I thought this game was interesting. But after about a few weeks of play the terrible gun balancing finally got me. You can manage to get kills with your starter equipment with serious metagame startegy, but the whole fool your enemy thing can go wrong quickly when they spot you trying to sneak up on them. So, I bought some of the in-game currency weapons. I still didn't stand a chance to the people who bought from the Arma Marketplace. The only thing that kept me going for longer than I should was the customization, you can customize almost anything of yours. That is the only thing I can complement about this game. Serious Pay To Win.
3735	0	a	I hate this game! Everybody you come across seems to be a much higher level than you with lots of game experience and awsome weaons, as for me, I only just started and got anihalated by averyone. They all had rocket launchers and grenade launchers, all I had was a pistol and SMG!
3736	0	a	love the game but all the hacks in this game, it's just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. and it sucks how there are no npcs to even fight either. it's strict always pvp fighting but I'd love there to be PvE fighting in the game also.
3737	0	a	Gets boring real easily. Customizations to your character and vehicles are extremely expensive, and you get killed a lot!
3738	0	a	This game is unique and addictive. It's like GTA, just that it has smaller maps. The gameplay is a lot batter and the customization is epic. Back when it came out i would recommend this game, but not anymore. I am not saying that all the things GamersFirst did were bad, but a lot of them were. Now let's go to the sad part. It has unbalanced missions and weapons, bad spawns, matchmaking, community and it contains lot's of bugs, that are not getting fixed. Marketplace is too expensive, the servers are unstable and are sometimes being ddosed. When that happens the ms jumps over 150, makes it unplayable. They are not adding any new stuff to the game that they promised long ago (like new contacts, free content) nor are they listening to community wishes. The engine upgrade has been in making for eva and they keep postponing the date of its release!  The game has been in a really bad shape for a long time and considering what have we the community seen so far, there is no chance it will get any better anytime soon, maybe never who knows....
3739	0	a	the game:  [cons] very rare updates, except when there is new cash shop items, which is really often. the frequency of new cashshop weapons shows the game weapon balance is .. lets say .. from non existant to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. repetitive, will get to know all of the game has to offer in under 1 hour.  [pros] One of the better player, clothing, vehicle costomization you can find. In game editor somewhat effecitve.  The gameplay:  [cons] pay to win, With a cashshop item, learn curve is non existant. repetitive 'missions' it pretty much boils down to a team death match in a different location on the map every time. Horrendous level design. Uber effective choke points renders knowing the map aka time spent in game, more important than your ability to land shots. voip is a must, require real life friends to play with you. no headshots, less lucky kills. less dynamics. steep and stable learning curve.   [pros] you get to drive cars. shoot guns wear fancy DIY textured clothings via in game editior 
3740	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.

3742	0	a	Alright, so I downloaded this in 2 hours. I was all happy about playing. Started playing, I loved customization, but then, when it came to playing, it was horrible, Enforcers are OVERPOWERED, with the stun guns, it's impossible to play. Don't waste time. Play some real things instead.
3743	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap?

3745	0	a	my game simply just wont load up :/
3746	0	a	Wow, snipers don't even show the scope, amazing.
3747	0	a	Going into APB Reloaded, I expected an alternative to GTA. One that had many traits that made GTA so successful. If you've ever played any of the GTA titles, you know what I mean. Anyways, this game is a very big download, so please, be prepared to wait. Once the game finally launched, you decide which faction you'd like to be apart of. Criminals, or Law Enforcement.   Each is unique in it's own way. The character creation is extremely in-depth, I'll give the game that.   But the main question is, is this game a good alternative to GTA? In my opinion, no. The game takes way to long to load, around 6-10 minutes EVERY time. The story line is hard to understand, and the game is very much Pay-to-win. You can tell within the first 15 minutes of playing the game. The game is NOT newb-friendly. In missions, if you are a low-level it is extremely hard to find a group that wont kick you out. You can't use planes, boats, ships, or anything for that matter. The only thing you can do, is hijack cars.  The ONLY joy I had in this game was hijacking cars, and shot random civilians. Which is one shot, instant kill. No matter what. It takes forever to become wanted by the police, and when you are, a big clash ensumes. Awsome right? Nah. I crashed every time I entered a deathmatch.  Overall: 5/10: Don't get this game.  Sum-up: A very limited, stripped down, version of GTA.
3748	0	a	I wouldnt recommend this game, it has way too many 'griever' players who enjoy ruining the game experience for you, blocking your escape with their van or trapping your car so that you can't use it, ramming you with their cars when you are in middle of your mission while they are not part of it, 'ghosts' who reveal your position to to hostile players while being invunerable to any damage due to fact not being part of the 'fight'.  But if you enjoy being harashed by those who are bored or just seek to troll you, then be my guest and have fun at the game,I've played it, I've enjoyed it, but I have better things to do than vent my frustration to occasional cheaters with unlimited car carry capacity, one shot five kills weapons, servers being full all the time, and more over being teamed with low tier people who has no idea what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to do and refuse to show or participate on teamplay and seek to solo it making it harder for the rest of the team.
3749	0	a	This game has the potential to be awesome but it sucks on so many levels. First off it is a massive grind, you have to invest a substantial amount of time into it to be able to unlock anything at all, even if you pay the monthly fee to increase your rates. On top of that you have a broken weapon system that leaves every weapon with an unrealistic niche forcing you to buy a ton of weapons to be able to fight in different areas of the map otherwise the guy with the weapon better tailored for that alleyway or that elevated highway is going to win regardless of how good he/you are.   The biggest flaw however is the ranking system in this game. It is absolutly impossible to play this game as a new player and have a decent time learning the game because the tiered ranking system apparently plays no role whatsoever in matchmaking. There are servers tiered for each rank on the list, but they are not locked for that rank so someone well beyond your skill level as judged by the game can join your server and will get matched against you in the matchmaking system every... single... game. It just isn't fun getting destroyed mission after mission by female avatars in knee stockings and miniskirts, or flat naked who have hours upon hours more invested in the game to unlock all of the guns and perks and cars and whatever else.   Game sucks, do yourself a favor and go get just cause 2 if you want a freeform driving multiplayer game, or world of warcraft if you want to spend hours of your life doing the same repetative â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for hours on end to raise up in level.
3750	0	a	the game stops responding when the game starts
3751	0	a	They make the game look amazing in the preview, but once you play the game it sucks, there are never any cops and never enough people to play with
3752	0	a	Populated with 12 year olds and pay to win. Don't even bother.
3753	0	a	Terrible game with terrible shooting mechanics.
3754	0	a	I hate this game! Everybody you come across seems to be a much higher level than you with lots of game experience and awsome weaons, as for me, I only just started and got anihalated by averyone. They all had rocket launchers and grenade launchers, all I had was a pistol and SMG!
3755	0	a	I really like the customization... but sadly the gameplay is ruined by a pay to win business model.
3756	0	a	Full of hackers, and the dev team is lazy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
3757	0	a	All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is a game that invokes many feelings. Off the top of my head, I can name relentless rage, grueling dissapointment, and cocky pride worthy of a guy that just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed Ariana Grande.  APB is a great concept. The backstory behind it is very deep, and the entire caracterization of the city of San Paro(however unoriginal that name might be) is very detailed and well done. It doesn't draw black and white lines: it's all a thick mist of grey, and it certainly asks you a question: are the oftentimes corrupt, control-obsessed vigilantes right? Or is it ethically correct to leave the city to the self-proclaimed renegades and anarchists, however chaotic and destructive they might be?  Remember, I'm talking about the CONCEPT here.  Because the realization of said concept is about as clear as a snowstorm in the deep ocean. The backstory and personality of the contacts and city is only presented by tedious text, mainly in the form of emails that most people just delete, or don't even bother to open. I even asked a friend, that has 20 hours clocked in the game, what the Enforcers were: he thought they were just straight-up police officers. That's just how bad the story is brought to the player.  Now for the gameplay. The core is good: Reloaded Productions managed to deliver a good third-person shooter, with interesting weapons and playstyles. The smart player that uses tactics will more often than not have an advantage over the kid that has spent countless dark nights crouched in front of his PC playing Call Of Duty, while perfecting his aim and surviving on Red Bull and Cheetos. However, like almost everything in this King Kong-sized dissapointment, this is ruined by two reasons:  1: The lag. Oh god, the lag. Unless the monthly cost for the servers is 3 bucks plus a cute picture of a cat, I cannot possibly wrap my head around how bad they are. Driving feels like standing on one foot. On a stick. Which is balancing on a banana held by a blind monkey with Parkinson. Often, during a unexpected encounter with a hostile player in the back alleys of the Financial District, I have either died because half of my shots didn't register, or I have won because my opponent's gun wasn't raised-which is a clear indication that some serious lags are going on.  2: The players. Sadly, the smart tactician is a long extinct species in San Paro, and the streets are now ruled by people such as 'Pu$$ySlayer69', 'lole_u_got_buttâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed' and 'UMAD BRAH??11?'. I am seriously not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you right now, I have seen all three of these names ingame.  Dare to be good, and you'll be called a dirty hacker. Dare to be even slightly worse than either your teammates or your opponents, or equip a weapon they dislike, and you'll be called n00b, â™¥â™¥â™¥, and come to the realization that most of these people have had sexual intercourse with your mother, or that they wish you to do the same.  There are quite some topics I haven't covered, such as the hackers, which constitute, based on other people's calculations, 9,7% of the players. An alarming number, but hard to confirm, so I will leave it there. There is also the company known as GamersFirst. Sadly, these people seem to identify 'Gamer' as 'Man with a lot of money and no need for a honorable fight'. For excruciating prices, you can buy certain weapons that will shred through any average player. (Note that I'm not saying all of them are OP: a decent chunk are either reskins, or equally powerful as the in-game weapons.) The excuse 'you can get it in game too' is true, because you DO unlock modifications and bonuses as you go, but I myself have clocked over a hundred hours and all I got was a useless magazine mod and a slight increase to marksman zoom.  The customization is unrivalled, though. I have tried to find a game, ANY game, that has better character creation or vehicle customization, but to no avail. Shame, because this pearl just had to be incrusted in the (mostly) dried up turd that is APB.  TL;DR: APB: Reloaded is a great concept, that was insufficiently realized by Reloaded Productions, and completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on by GamersFirst, after they took over the game. You could of course take a look, because, hey, it's free, but greedy business ideals have screwed over the concept so bad that the game is now singing it's dying song.
3758	0	a	Went and played this game for 20 minutes, lags like sh*t and gives me a punkbuster kick within 5 minutes. -&gt; DELETE
3759	0	a	I ignored APB for a long time, but due to a lack of other games I tried it. Generally, it is a solid Multiplayer PVP Game and makes fun for a short period time, but it has too many negative aspects in my opinion.  Pro's:  -Kind of GTA online clone.  -You can play and level Cops and Criminals.  -The design option is very big and funny. You can spend hours creating Vehicles, Style etc.  -Nice Cities with good spots and nice surroundings.  Con's: -As always in such games there is a ton of aimbot users most on criminal side in my opinion, wich ruins balancing totally in many missions. -Missions get very boring after a couple of days, cause they are always the same. Its only 4-5 different mission types on each side. -Most of the random players are not cooperative and not playing in team. They dont use chat and running like chickens into the other teams. Very frustrating when you have highlevel players and premade teams against you.  -For such a little online game it has way too many lags, what makes combat sometimes too stressy.  -The loading time is way too long. It needs up to 5 min. to get into the game, and you can not do anything else at this time cause the launcher makes your saystem slow, otherwise the game crashes. Thats not a resource problem its the simple game client.  -BUT Worst thing is the Pay to win! faction. Get better guns and bonuses from the shop or get 50% more than all other players. WTF...Without premium this game is nearly not playable. For example with premium I did level 4 Factions in one day to max, without it I did not even get one of them two levels up and got so much less money, that I can't get any better weapons.   After a week of playing alone and with freinds, I can only say...In the end you have to do frustrating and boring Mission farming....the design option is funny and fight can be thrilling sometimes, but after a couple of missions even that doesnt make it better. And thats the point where I stop playing such games.  If you like playing games where free to play means 'Counter strike' with frustrating and boring farming 80% of the time, and if its not bother you that a game has so many aimbot players, try it, otherwise leave it be and do something better with your time.     
3760	0	a	Terrible performance on AMD graphic cards. Lots of memory crashs and couldn't find any help in the forum for my problems. Game looks on max settings almost like on minimum due to a lack of optimization. If it runs well on your system good for you but if not invest a lot of time in trouble shooting...
3761	0	a	Be all you can't be, in this game everyone wants to be a hacker.
3762	0	a	This game is one of the worst pieces of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i've ever played in my life. I had a LOT of hours into it without the steam version, so I believe I know what i'm talking about. Worst Cop vs Criminal game Of ALL TIME. You start out with the Star 556 and some piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pistol.Well,i'll inform you now that the gun mechanics are SUPER unrealistic,you can have someone take a BUTT ton on bullets to only turn around and shoot you with thier premium gun Oh?You said premium Yep,Premium. G1 wants you to pay for guns and bundles at RIDICULOUSLY high prices so you can have a advantage over other players. The game loves to do that to people. Match making is pure â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, running rampant with hackers who have NICE â™¥â™¥â™¥ guns who dominant everyone who moves. It also seems as if Criminals have a advantage over Cops, like they just DO BETTER.  This game is awful. I spent 40$ on it. Never agian. Stay away from it. This game is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 
3763	0	a	bad and very hard to see whats going on
3764	0	a	I really like the customization... but sadly the gameplay is ruined by a pay to win business model.
3765	0	a	This game is probably the best example of Pay 2 Win abominations. While the concept of the game is nice and the gameplay is pretty easy to get used to, it suffers from numerous very serious problems.  Graphics of the game is slightly above average. It doesn't really look bad, but you'll quickly notice that the optimization is rather flawed and the game is unstable and choppy.  When it comes to music, there are several radio stations to listen to, so you could say there's a bit for everyone. Even classical music, which was my personal favorite.  The gameplay itself is okay, but servers often crash and you'll have a hard time finding one that doesn't lag like hell. As I mentioned before, this is pretty much purely a Pay 2 Win game. While you earn some in-game cash to buy yourself new clothes, new cars and other stuff for your 'image', weapons can only be bought for about a week and then they disappear again. So you must either play 24/7 in order to earn enough, or just pay real money for that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. And let me tell you - most of those pathetic kids do it. Stuff that you buy with real money is ridiculously overpowered, so you'll just end up angry playing against such no-lifers. The game is also swarmed by cheaters and nobody usually gives a damn about it, so they just keep cheating.  There is no story. You can either play as a cop or as a criminal. You fight each other in a number of game modes. All of them include shooting each other and some include car chases. You get thrown to the game without any tutorial, so you don't know what to do and you must learn the hard way. The community mostly isn't friendly, let alone willing to help you.  The best thing about this game is the customization. There's a wide range of clothes, colors and accessories. You can also create your own decals for both your car and your character. It's also important to mention that you get to create your character before you begin. You can change your face, but also your body. And options here have almost no limits.  What can I say? Despite its great customization options, good concept and fine gameplay, I can't recommend this game. All the fun you can have is quickly ruined by P2W people, cheaters, bad optimization, unstable servers and a very unfriendly community.
3766	0	a	Full of hackers, and the dev team is lazy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
3767	0	a	I wish it was good, but it isn't. Cash shop driven, not enough content, cheaters EVERYWHERE. The theory is good, execution bad, and this will never change as developer is underpowered to fix it.
3768	0	a	One of the worst games on steam.

3770	0	a	I am very disappointed about this game, I was told this game had genitalia and it doesn't, shameful.
3771	0	a	The first impression is that you're in for an amazing experience. But the more you spend playing, the more you realise how much troublesome it is to play this game. Firstly, the servers are underwhelming. Secondly, the game is absolutely pay to win. I repeat, you WILL NOT be able to achieve ANYTHING WORTHWHILE in THIS DONKEY GAME unless you're willing to spend your whole monthly savings. A no from me.

3776	0	a	Filled with bugs and really badly written. Should be alpha mora than an actual release.
3777	0	a	why this game always said that the connection lost ? my internet is fast enough to play online. and you never fix this problem ?
3778	0	a	absolutly broken game. the customization if phenomenal the game is great. but the match making in the game completely ruins the game 100%. as a new player you WILL get paired up against people who are damn near max rank and have been playing for years. and the devs are complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ heads who wont fix there game. if you havent been playing for a year youre going to lose. the game is also WAY to heavily reliant on getting mods for your character and weapons none of which come easy. untill they fix the match making i will always say no to this game.
3779	0	a	I couldn't even play the freaken game because the stupid sky and screen of the game kept giltching and i couldn't even see. whatever you do save your memory and save your money. i would give it a 1 out of 10 if they could fix it. which might not even happen. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3780	0	a	Pros:  - Fun Gunplay (to a certain extent)  - Extremely indepth customization.  Cons:  - Balancing issues (Certain guns can 1/2 shot lower level vehicles.)  - Terrible Matchmaking system. (Someone with &lt;1 hour of gameplay can get matched with someone of &gt;3000 hours.)  - Server Issues  
3781	0	a	AWFUL, AWFUL GAME. The controls are horrendously awkward, and the entire time playing it feels like a game that wants desperately to be Saints Row. The entire time spent playing is wondering what i am even supposed to do. It feels like Gmod Roleplay added some cars and said 'yep that looks about right' and then tried to sell you expansion packs for $100. Dont waste the time downloading it. Buy Saints Row instead and you will end up gett a better gameplay experience, a story line, and characters that dont feel like cardboard cut-outs with speakers taped on.

3785	0	a	high population servers lag.the slowest loading game ever hit detection needs work.pay to win.....
3786	0	a	UPDATE, yeah well it's good game in a way if there not was so much PAY TO WIN over it + ever high is most time always a camping noob or a run away or just dont know how to attack or always wait on you to attack so more or less, most golds dont have any balls at all or just only sniper wtih a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing noob nano or some other armas noob weapons and yeah i have been really good to play this game a time but now i only play wtih friends more or less for after 2 years this game is all about PAY to WIN now and no longer about skills X( it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sad and yes as you can see i have played close to 2000hours and it's more for i played befor it was on Steam so i say give one try and if it sucks than just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it side ways ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- if you like GTA 4 you need to play this for it like GTA 4 in MMO just of cause you can lvl up and unlock things but you can close to customization all the way you want! :D for me it's one of the best game ever!
3787	0	a	Well its fun and all but ever since the old verison of it got removed and the good graphics got removed into â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ones well it now sucks... :/ besides why they had to remove the styled 'choose your team' GUI and now its a basic one... And the menu instead of it having a criminal and cop its just a riot for the menu...
3788	0	a	This game would have been fun but you have to download like 6 things and i still cant play. I cant delete it because it says its running when its not. If they cant fix all this download crap that you have to do and just keep is simple i would think about downloading it again.

3790	0	a	It is a complete P2W game. 2 shotgun shells on the enemy can't kill him/her, and a few bullets, probably 3-4 from a rifle killed me. Turns out the enemy is a cash player and had a lot of attachments on his/her guns, and is also able to destroy a car in a few bullets.  Close to none PvE in the game, with almost no choice of weapons until a few weeks ago, which set you with only 2 permanent guns to choose from, which one of them is the default rifle.  Overall, unless you love getting owned by P2W players and was ok with being randomly teamed against players obviously stronger than you, it's a good game.
3791	0	a	Free 2 play pay 2 win game
3792	0	a	it wont let me luanch apb i press start then it wont load
3793	0	a	It can be fun at first, but when you actually play it for a few days and try to make money get a decent gun. That's when the game starts to get boring, REALLY BORING. If you're playing as a criminal It takes hundreds of hours to make enough money, and theres a high chance that a cop might just come and bust you up then take all of your stash. There's a LOT of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s in this game, and if you don't want to always rage like crazy. Then this is not the game for you, it is not worth your time AT ALL. One more thing, this is a completely pay-to-win game. Where the rich players one shot you, and you're there shooting like an idiot. Even when you start shooting them first from behind, they totally got enough time to turn around and shoot you in the face. Why? BECAUSE YOU'RE USING A FREE WEAPON. Don't play this game!
3794	0	a	APB... APB its, its amazeing! The customization, The Detail. It had me playing it for hours. To the point where I wouldnt even know the sun has passed and the day was over. Though the community can be harsh. Thats not so bad. All the guns are ballenced, So i thought.  All the guns you get (In-Game with out paying) are ballenced, I am even talking about you annoying OSMAW, You are balenced as well. The thing is, Some guns in the 'ARMAS Market' Are just plain, stupid. I mean like the universal ATAC or the NANOS. Those wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt mixed in with the commonly known 'De-Threaters'. People who lose matches (So they may join bronze servers, Though they may be a gold threat rank) often ruin the fun time, Win or loss, i may be haveing with my friends. It is just a major killjoy when a bronze comes in with a ATAC and NANO, His skills are just way beyond me or my friends. As they reck havoc on all the missions, till they hit gold. Just to dethreat back to bronze, to repeat the process.  Another problem is the rerolls, People who make new accounts so they wont have to 'De-Threat'. Rerolls are quite common. As the fact i am a R212 and a R009 will join and kick me and my teams butt... Alone. With no help. Not saying they hack, I know some ppl have VERY Good skills on games. It just makes it hard for me to return to such a beuitifull game. This legit  'One of a kind'  game. It saddens me about all the problem this game has.   Lastly my ending result for this game. Sadly would be to  AVOID IT . It is very fun, Very Addicting, Very... Frusterating, Screen punching frusterating. Unless you are a natural born shooter. Evrey one I have talked to agree, that g1 (The Game owners) only have this game running because it is a 'Legit' Money farm for them, All they do is care for the money. I mean look up the prices for your self. All and All this game would be a five of ten for me.  Thank you for reading this review on this wonderfull game.

3800	0	a	Terribly wasted potential. I was in the Beta for this game many years ago, and I even pre-ordered it when it came out. However, after Real Time World went under, and it was picked up again by Reloaded, everything went down the toilet. As said countless times before, the customization is amazing, and I really wish it could see it's full potential. However as we've seen, that's never going to happen.
3801	0	a	Fun yet stupid game if your going to play this you either need a lot of money or you need to be able to withstand lots and lots of rage and stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ matchmaking is broke as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

3806	0	a	So let's get this rolling.  This game is addictive as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ due to being just so much fun at the lower levels but when you progress your threat changes and you will be placed with much harder opponents. The problem is there is no required level for this threat, meaning low level players can reach the highest threat level and then they are for the most part â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. You face enemies that have so much stuff or spend real money on the game that you just get face rolled.   Which doesn't help the match making, that's broken as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. At late game you get placed into such unfair matches that it releases the devil inside you. Placing you in games with unbalanced amount of players or threat level. We were two silver threat levels playing against 2 highest level gold threat players and being facerolled.  Then there is the problem of Pay 2 Win. This game has the most OP Pay to win system I have ever seen. You can buy the max level guns and items at any level, meaning you get players just owning you at lower threats and levels. These guns can be obtained (Sort of) at the highest level but just think for a moment, low level players with end game guns....  Now for servers. The servers are for the most part fine, the problem is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing way the game uses the servers. Almost everything is server side, so lag? Tough â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. You're going to crash and backtrack the whole time, also the server side thing doesn't work for international players as they have delayed â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing everything. Delayed controls on vehicles, delayed hit detection, delayed death and damage. Making the game feel like a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  The Weapons in the game are for the most part good except for the OP Premium guns that are sold on the market. The guns expire every 10 days and they don't cost a high amount but the problem is that the Guns you pay â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money for also expire, although the period is 30 days instead of 10. So when you come back after taking a break from the game, you'll find out that you have no weapons and have thrown more money at the game to unlock those weapons that are required to even win matches.  The game's customization is simply amazing, the company that owns the game host events for artists to create new works of art for the game and if they win they get allowed to sell it on the premium store, but the problem here is you have to pay to be able to make anything. That's right, you have to pay for fonts, icons, decals and much more to be able to make something. Anyway to skip that part is to buy vehicles or clothes that are on the market and have been customized. Lastly there is the way this game makes you rage, with the lag and the pay 2 win style, the most anoying part is when you die, you get played a taunt from the enemy that can be really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing anoying. This game has made me rage so much on my friends that we stopped playing it.  In the end, I wonder why I even played this game for so long.
3807	0	a	just another P2W, being a criminal in real life it's cheaper than this laggy game full of aimboter players, so go on and use those $10000 that you're paying for this game and use them for a real gun.
3808	0	a	Pay to win... Just: 'Pay to win'...
3809	0	a	Do not download this game, it is fun an all, but for a little, the matchmaking is terrible, you might be just starting to play, 1 minute into the game and you can get a mission vs highest rank with max weapons and such. Also, people get banned for no reason, me and my brother got banned for using 'hacks' if i'm correct in which if skype counts as hacks than thats just ridiculous. Do not recommend this, it is fun, but it gets you more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off more than anything.
3810	0	a	This game is terrible. I'm so tired of mmo developers thinking that they can get away with aweful gameplay. The matchmaking is down right infuriating. The worst part has to be the driving as it feels like you are driving on ice the entire time. The gun play is lackluster and something I would expect from a ps2 launch title not a PC game from this decade.
3811	0	a	This game sucks balls. wont update
3812	0	a	Basically, if GTA was an mmo and was pretty dull and just generally boring with near nothing to do and pay-to-win weapons.
3813	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it crashes like crazy... and i couldn't even start it.. no wonder it's free... DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
3814	0	a	This game doesnt works propertly. This game dor idiots. Please fix it. when i enter misions game kicks me on steam.
3815	0	a	game started to crash after first launc (
3816	0	a	Confusing missions. Empty streets. Definite pay to win vibe: standard guns can't kill the enemy fast enough before they can kill you. Even from point blank range. Runs clunky on high graphic settings, even with a 2GB card
3817	0	a	When i joined this, it was fun, but it forced me to have to buy more ram just to play, but even then i lagged during any battle..  reason i dont reccomend this: SUPER cpu heavy, it lags bad if you dont have a serious up to date graphic card or more then 8gb ram, seems they put alot into graphics which causes older computers or people who dont buy computers every year not able to play it.  i still login from time to time, but it became un-fun when it was nothing but trolls bashing your car/truck into walls with garbage trucks, or children screaming on the voice system just to annoy you.  i dont reccomend this if you have a older cpu, or cant handle the graphics, also if you cant deal with kiddy trolls bashing you every 5 mins not allowing you to do anything.
3818	0	a	First of all, no, I have not played this game for 10 hrs...barely 15 min is enough suffering.  The reason that the couter is on 10 hrs probably due the uncloseable trashy game egnine, I have to restart Steam 3 times and not less than 10 times from the library to actually launch the game. And when you try to exit, the crappy game engine will not close and decide to stay in your computer to steal your computer resource.  Okay, maybe it is just my computer. Let get into the game. Principle of the game is good, bad guys vs cops in an open city and bad behaviour leads to wanted level and popo would then hunt you down.  However the gameplay experience is just bad as licking turd on the buttom of your shoes. If you try to drive any vehicle, the steering has a horrible delay like your are controlling Mars rover on Earth. Go check in the forum and you will see how comman this problem is. Customize your character ? cool! Even better if it does not take you 30 seconds to load a new hair style on the each selection. It is a free game, so I would not complain about the pay-to-win mechanism here. In fact I manage to kill an enemy with only half the magazine of my first rifle, not too bad. Oh yea, not too bad if you can withstand the dial-up-alike ping. For the record I played a lot online games and I am pretty sure my connection is decent on normal games. I lived in UK and the EU server gives me 140ms ping and very constant lag spikes, I guess the game server is just too busy to serve me then.  2 / 10. Rubbish game, but its free, also lag like a very unfinished development game.  Good for you spending your time reading this, now u can save your computer space, also your treasure time instead of investing into the game. You are welcome.
3819	0	a	I've been playing APB Reloaded before any of this new breed stuff was even talked about while yes the game is free and quite fun it is a open world RPGMMO but heres the thing the majority of the people in the game are basically maxed out in R wepons and cars which makes actually starting new very very hard the game is quite aggrivating when the missions are one sidded which they most usually are i love the game i truly do but would i honestly wouldnt recomend it to anyone new unless i had a group that is constantly playing this game which i do not.
3820	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3821	0	a	If you see an hour played, thats the time ive tried starting the game and cant even play it -.-
3822	0	a	This game requires that you downgrade your graphics drivers pretty heavily for the game to even launch at all. Sorry APB, but I'm not going back to 2011's geForce drivers just for you.
3823	0	a	/
3824	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
3825	0	a	A glorified, pay to win version of cops and robbers in which to kill someone you have to run around like a madman and throw explosives at anything that moves. also, your guns do as much damage as flicking a pea.
3826	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. I really did. The customization is amazing, more games need to have this type of personalization. And that's the only good thing about it. The game itself barely works, controls are awful, the community is horrible (you get called a n00b by others when you ask politely for help and their best advice is to 'git gud â™¥â™¥â™¥ lel'), glitches everywhere. I'm going to quote another reviewer because everyone else has pretty much summed it up: 'Complete garbage and full of hackers of all kinds.'
3827	0	a	i play this game often but its fun, but there is one major thing i dont like in a PVP F2play. ITS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PAY TO WIN. There is no form of pve(maybe a bit for crims so mug and steal) like there is nothing to fight when you aren't in machmaking. (oh and before i forget SPEND 1,000+ DOLLORS TO INJOY THIS GAME IN PVP). The matching in this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gold like to farm kills in new and bronze lvl sever(G1 fix that) most thing in arms is over priced and OP(i TRIED some) there is also lots of grinding for f2p players. And let me not forget. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ IN ONE VIDEO GAME AT A TIME ITS SAD ALL THEY DO IS TALK â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND GO AFTER NOOBS. AND THEN INSULT YOU ITS SAD. Oh and dont get me started on bountys. &gt;_&gt; thats all i gotta say(wen you have a bounty no one can help you now kiddys .-.)  Now some good things(the few reasons i keep playing this game BUT havent spent a peny on it). The costumisation(it also has cons on to it). It is nice the fact you get to costimize your character BUT for F2P platers its limmited.   THE CARS(I LOVE MY CAR &lt;3) cars they have nice cars in game when you unlock them. (as a crim) MUGGING AND STEALING-FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN, BUT hold up there are some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥(if the car isnt owned by you) who will take from that car you stole and stored stuff in. They can also blow it up even if its yours or not. NOW FOR A LIST OF MORE CONS IN GAMEPLAY #1-Hit box-delay #2-aiming-SHOOT INTO THE WALL WILL YAH #3Cover-DONT HIDE FROM A SNIPER BEHIND A CAR they can still get ya #4-Pay 2 Win- OP guns in arms anot enough good ones in game #5-SSSPAWNING(more in fight club) GET READ TO BE STAWN KILLED #5-The matchmaking- unfair matchup (one team new players other golds). #6(im not to sure on this one) HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAXXXXXXX-from what ive heard that is. although ive seen some imposible stuff(no not like 360 noscope like in cod like shooting through walls always knowing where you are aimbot(i think)).  Over all I would recomend it but it has alot to fix, so its up to you if you wanna play it. And plz try to have fun dont take anything sereusly mainly because its a game.   (i just want car parts new clothes and drive around fancy looking is that to much to ask in a game).   (i am sorry for my spelling)   5/10
3828	0	a	pay2win game with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of hackers  although it's probably the best of it's genre with the features provided in the game, it's still shitinfested with tons of faggs and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dev team  tons of faggs, meaning that the game has probably one of the worst communities in mmo history

3831	0	a	it sucks 
3832	0	a	I cant believe i even came back to this Pay To Win kind of game.   Never again.
3833	0	a	This game has a great concept but poor impimentation. The driving is buggy, the servers constantly lag, and there isn't much of a tutorial. Missions are fun, but there's no real progression that reels you in. The only progression you have is upgrading your gear so you can earn more money so you can upgrade your gear (sounds quite Runescape-esque to me). In any case, this game can be fun with a few friends and in limited doses. 6/10.
3834	0	a	This game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... just spent the last hour downloading this and updating it to click a start butten telling me to like it after that nothing happens. i click the play butten on steam again and just get a blank screen.
3835	0	a	i dont know it sucks i played this game for 10weeks before it came in steam and then a few hours from steam... they banned me for no reason they said that i had 'hacking' programs in my pc so id suggest pepole do not play it cause the same might happen to you
3836	0	a	I've played this game extensively before it came to Steam. If you're looking for a F2P version of GTA, this isn't it. Move along, nothing to see here.  It's not a bad game but it shouldn't be taken seriously. It's rife with hackers, griefers and players who will 'ghost' you during missions. You won't be able to kill them and they can follow you around, distract you, block your objectives, ram your vehicle and tell their allies exactly where you are.  The cash shop in this game is ridiculous. It's like Korean MMO-worthy. One gun can cost you $60 and that's just for a single gun. The monetization doesn't stop there...not on your life and it's incredibly Pay2Win as well.  Now, I know I was just complaining about how the game is full of griefers but to be honest that's really the most fun aspect of the game...doing stuff like taking 4 dumptrucks and blocking off a major highway or parking outside a car garage, leaving a little open space for cars to get through...and when they try to get through...moving in their way as they angrily yell at your immovable dumptruck, causing them to spend more money to re-spawn their vehicle elsewhere.  If you play the game with that kind of attitude, just messing around and having fun...it's not bad. But if you try to play the game seriously, you'll get punked out everytime by either hackers (which run rampant and unchecked) or people who have spent hundreds in the cash shop...or both.
3837	0	a	'Kicked from server for exesive team killing'. Why does it have a name if you arent allowed to do it. Should call it boredom relief, maybe team poppin'. Anywho, game is a money trap, if you have money you dont want or like anymore, go ahead and waste it on this game. So many people look like speed hackers equiped with guns that shoot straight and/or long distance.
3838	0	a	Positives:  &gt; Insane character and vehicle sustomization. Designing the charcter is quite fun. &gt; Frequent promotional stuff to keep you interested. (free premium account time)  Negatives: &gt; Persistent lag: This is the only reason why the game isn't playable for me right now. The lag is very frustrating and an unavoidable part of the game. The probability of lag is lower in low population servers(where there are like only 5 guys) But playing in low population servers means extremely long mission queues and low payots without opposition. It is no fun at all.
3839	0	a	mehhhh â™¥â™¥â™¥ not really i dunno  is it good? nah could I GET INTO A SERVER? NO
3840	0	a	Fun game, terrible support, filled with trolls and hackers. The cars and robber / cop faction was fun. Go buy GTA and skip this one.

3846	0	a	This game... this game is partially unique. But there are SERIOUS problems.  1) There's no tutorial of any kind, you get put straight into a lobby with real people. 2) Those real people almost always have sniper rifles, or a gun that fires faster than yours. Basically, 9/10 times, you're pretty screwed. And those peopleare the ones you have to do missions against! 3) The cars handle like GTA 3, with the tyres popped. On ice. 4) The interface is astonishingly confusing, and like I mentioned before, there's no tutorial. The game assumes you know what you're doing. 5) The mini-map in the corner doesn't show buildings, or anything of much use. The only thing you can really tell is whether someone is behind you or not. But you don't need a map, you have a sniper bullet in your skull for that.  That's just five of the many, many problems this game has.  I highly recommend...Not getting this. Even though it's free, and does supply a bit of a laugh with friends, it isn't much of a game. It's like a concept for GTA.  **EDIT - And I still have no idea what APB stands for.
3847	0	a	This game is run by Gamersfirst, which should be named GamersLast.  It bans ppl for no reason and take away G1C. Worst part is, you can't do anything about. There used to a place where you can submit a ticket and complain, but they removed that....  SO bottom line.... if you play this game, and get to a higher level...you should expect to get banned like legit gamers like us.  Don't waste your time and money on Gamersfirst...
3848	0	a	boring.
3849	0	a	friend told me to try it, not a fan it looks abandoned by any sort of admin because modders run rampant and destroy the game
3850	0	a	Do not play. christ its a buggy game with no hitboxes, terrible gunplay, and its pay 2 win.
3851	0	a	Once I got over the horrible sign in with Steam feature I watched some pretty dramatic videos that gave me a rough introduction to the dangerous world of San Paro. After choosing my faction (Criminal or Enforcer) I was pushed into a character customization screen. The character customization in this game is absolutely horrible. I would click on different traitrs and such to edit my character but it wouldn't change anything. Once I had exited and re entered enough times to find a decent pre set skin I jumped over to the next screen. Here I was supposed to name my character and chose a server to play on. I did so naming him of course Mackie D. and choosing the closest server however the game would not allow me to click next and begin the game. I waited thinking maybe my PC was running behind but nothing happened. The menu eventually faded into some sort of an idle screen and when I swivvled the mouse the server select returned. Still I could not get passed that menu and into the game. Since I can't even play the game I'm gonna have to say that I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME to anyone. Unless they have an idea on how to fix my problemo.
3852	0	a	Although the game is really good it has the most amazing customization on any game ever created you can customise basically anything and the gameplay is okay-ish. Now the bad things about this game: Lagg and i mean ALOT OF LAGG and it seems they don't do alot to fix it it get's even more broken with every patch, 2nd thing P2W if you're unfamilliar it means PAY2WIN basically buy guns and you just do good even if you were born 2 seconds ago and you found out what a mouse is. 3rd Hackers and like lagg its ALOT of them and the worst thing is that the producers of the game don't do anything about it if you payed money for this game, You can just hack away you'll never get banned. Not to mention the in-game community is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But since it is a 'free' game i guess you can download it and try it out and yes you will have some fun with it until you just start raging at hackers or lame vip missions etc.
3853	0	a	Never even got it too load up
3854	0	a	If you have money you can enjoy this game, if you don't... well good luck.
3855	0	a	This game had a good cocept when the previous company had it. This game can be fun, but every single server you will encounter hackers and more bs. It's mostly a buy to win game, and they're milking it at this point.
3856	0	a	Pretty close to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
3857	0	a	It's free but it barely works. World is dreadfully boring to look at. The menus are messy. It was a good idea that was made horribly.
3858	0	a	Laggy gameplay, car physics broken, seemingly bad input lag, under average shooting mechanics. There are better free games out there than this.
3859	0	a	Game is okay, nothing spectacular though
3860	0	a	This game is more then just pay to win, it's pay to play. Your cash rewards, experience, and so forth are all dramatically reduced if you don't buy their VIP. It's not just that though, they refuse to make any new guns that you can actually unlock in the game. Every new gun is one you have to pay for! Not a single new gun has been released to public aviablilty since the restart of the actual game from APB, All Points Bulletin. If that doesn't make it bad enough, to truely enjoy yourself in the game you need to be a VIP. Why? Better and longer trials for weapons and cars, not to mention the ability to customize yourself and vehicle, emblems, and more to higher extents. The only game worse then this with a worse pay to win system is WarZ now known as 'Infestation Stores.' It is though fun to play once you're a high enough level, hackers are dealt with much easier now because of the anti-hack system known as Fair Fight was installed. There's without a doubt of equalization in weapons, but that equalization is in the ones you pay for. The graphics aren't bad, controls, mechanics, and interest isn't bad at all actually. From climbing ladders to driving off ramps from unfinished highways, civilians actively moving about the map to simply running over criminals or enforcers to catching criminals in acts of crime. There's a lot of innovation, tons of little areas to be found even when you think you know all the maps and secret locations. I can honestly say if it wasn't for the pay to win system this would be without a doubt the greatest game ever made. It's like Grand Theft Auto 4 and Need For Speed: Most Wanted (the original for Xbox 360.) You can steal a civilan car for the lulz of it, or make your own from a fairly wide range of choices and if you decide to dump cash into this game that customization can truely be starstriking. I've never seen a game with more customization options in my life. If this game allowed you to unlock everything over time it'd be an absolute reccommendation, but it not only doesn't try to do this but HEAVILY avoids it. Potential never met.  Did I mention they made it so you have to buy upgrades for your friend and ignore list, or that new content is never given to those who don't pay...?
3861	0	a	Bad Community, Bad Servers, Good Game. Don't play without doing so with someone expirienced.
3862	0	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks u cant download it it is a gllitch 
3863	0	a	when i can even get this game to work its awseome but i had to make a new charter when i saved and my pc crashed 5 min after
3864	0	a	APB:reloaded.... i simply dont like this game, everything, EXACTLY everithing MUST BE PAY2WIN, also the missions are bad. this is my personal opinion btw... if you like open world but hate p2w (pay2win) then simply dont download this game.
3865	0	a	I will say this, I wanted to go back to this game after playing it during my highschool days and dropping it after say a few months.  The game is amazing on customization as in beautifully stunning in the fact that EVERYTHING can be changed with your character (Clothing to body) and Cars and guns (albeit with premium limitations on designing) but beyond sitting in the hub far from the sh!tstorm that is the open world of APB:R, there isn't much more to be said about it, if anything I would rather pick up the game just to twiddle with the fun customization stuff you can do than hoping and praying that I can have a fun firefight with all kinds of players that isn't laggy or one sided on who has a sniper/rocket launcher or an ARMAS bought gun.
3866	0	a	Doesn't want to load
3867	0	a	this game sucks

3873	0	a	all the horrible things are true..... so true..... PLUS if you play as bandit you just randomly surrender.  this game will lower your opinion of the human race no matter how bad it already was
3874	0	a	so bad  hard controls  not fun
3875	0	a	I'm playing on a 2500 dollar game rig that was built within the last 6 months. With my setup this game plays for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I can barely get 20 fps during combat. Customisation is amasing, though. I hear it's p2w, but I can't confirm as I can't really play it.
3876	0	a	This worst game what made with unreal engine...so many server lags...full of cheaters and bugs.How it's still alive?  Or why not made another game like this?
3877	0	a	This game is really bad, the only fun thing was finding a fast car to drive. I liked that I could really customize my character only to finding my character would spawn as a floating hair peace, eyes, a mouth, a pair of shoes and a floating gun. The missions made no sense and had no direction on how to perform the job,let alone could you find your health or change that set up making game-play too complicated, as well as, the game was easy to hack, a conversation happened in chat and next thing I know every car you touched exploded, or people shooting infinite grenades and lagging the server. If you hadn't fallen through the ground yet the game crashes instead, dying instantly as you spawn,pvp glitching the f out and making everyone try to kill you and being stuck looking at your dead body with out being able to re-spawn. At first I liked that I could add my music to the 'in-game player', until I found that the game corrupted all of my music(mp3,mp2) on my PC... by the way that includes game music/sounds for other games!, cut scenes with no sound, like playing any game on mute. If your thinking theirs an update for this game the last one was almost a year ago.. it's not going to happen. Don't even try the game!
3878	0	a	It looked cool at first. A GTA like game where you could be a criminal or a vigilante cop, fighting for control of the streets. I was hugely disappointed. It has extremely little story content. There is way too much competition for missions. Say you need to kill a guy. When you find him, turns out someone else got him. This happens over and over. The missions are just instanced PVP. Thats all the game is- PVP. Yeah, I know that's the main aspect of the game, but it doesnt work. GTA mechanics are just copied, and they are much lamer. I played some GTA games before, and it gives you an adrenaline rush, speeding away from cop cars and helicopters. APB doesn't give you the same feeling. You would think that more people and another side- vigilantes- would enhance gameplay. It sorely fails.  In short, GET THE REAL GTA GAMES. Not this copy piece of crap.
3879	0	a	Take this from a guy who has played this game for 200 hours.  I started playing this game shortly after i became free to play in 2011 and I liked it. I played with my friends and they also liked it. But then I started noticing it had problems.  Graphics: It's graphics are okay and to be expected of a free to play game that was originaly created in 2010 but nothing to be amazed of.  The guns: For some reason the creators think people want a bilion guns to choose from, it's fine they excist but it ruins the came that they are so much better and you HAVE to spent real money on the REALLY good guns. Ruins it.  Gameplay: It depens, if you have a team of good players and you play against some fair people it's a great gameplay you have but that allmost never happens. Often you play against some scumbags who is premium and have bought a premium snipergun that oneshot's you. That is was ruin your game.  I can't really recommend it, yes I have enjoyed it but no, it's not worth it.
3880	0	a	Play this if you want to get screwed by hackers and people who payed for their guns. It's the perfect example of Free-2-Pay crap.
3881	0	a	Banned by punkbuser for 'cheating' when I certainly did not. Poor custom support, NOT RECOMMENDED.
3882	0	a	Game sucked major â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GG pay2win, would rather play Hello Kitty Online Adventures, save your life and desk space and dont even bother installing this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. peace
3883	0	a	Graphics are good but its a complicated game u need 1 month or 2 to completely understand this game or complete training period.Go for dota 2,phantom recon ghost,team fortress or ghost multiplayer. ~Cheers
3884	0	a	But the guns you win almost buy a car to win WITH REAL CASH!
3885	0	a	I am very disappointed about this game, I was told this game had genitalia and it doesn't, shameful.
3886	0	a	Realy bad for new players as people have 2 many op weapons and you cant catch up
3887	0	a	This game is lame. You can try it, but it'll gona be a dissapointment.
3888	0	a	no getting while head whielw weew
3889	0	a	COOL BUT CAN GET OLD
3890	0	a	As soon as it was done installing, it would just show a small box and not the actual game so thats why I'm going to uninstall then reinstall to see if it works. If it does I'll send a Yes on recommending it, if it doesn't then I'm going to try to send a No on recommending it and go talk to someone about it.
3891	0	a	This game would be one of the best games out there and one of the most fun games you could possible play with friends. However. It is not. Simply because it is so much pay-to-win from the moment you enter that it becomes a matter of who has the more money. missions are fought against other players and since the game is so pay-to-win It is impossible to properly play for a person who can not buy weapons from the real-money stores. Weapons that includes a sniper which you can jump with and thus be rather agile. One shot to the head with that thing and you are pretty much dead.  It is a very fun game but Pay-to-Win kills it shortly after you start. Sure its possible that you come up against people who does not have these kinds of weapons. But most of the time you will have to deal with Pay-to-Win people as soon as you hit gold ranks  Unless you want to pay for weapons that are overpowered compared to what non-paying players can get. I'd suggest you pass on this game. That is my opinion.
3892	0	a	Coustomizations in this game are awesome... but unless you REALY REALY love dieing over and over to Rocketlaunchers and Sniper fire then you probablly wanna find another game to satisfy your Medium to short range game play. Long range dominates in this game. If you dont mind repetitive deaths and not even seeing where 1/2 of it comes from... then this games for you!   Oh BTW you dont get a sniper rifle or rocket launcher starting out... you have to work your way to them. Oh yeah, and you dont get xp unless you win against these people! so Happy gaming!
3893	0	a	Accumlated 3.5k hours on this game. It's garbage, dont do it.
3894	0	a	dont even bother, the devs are milking this game for every micro transaction its worth and then some.

3896	0	a	I Spawned as a cop, ran over 10 people, shot 5, wrecked 3 cars and unistalled due to gameplay. Man it sucks, what type of cop am ?
3897	0	a	Nothing good to be found in APB Reloaded.
3898	0	a	I think i'll give you a thumbs up if you could balanced that ranking system.. like seriously i'm only rank 50, fighting against rank 255 with full modded weapons and vehicles and an instant death grenade launcher / OSMAW.. this is seriously stupid and i've lost interest in it.. threat system is stupid and not balanced.. the high ranked player 195++ will easily owned Gold with just a normal weapon without character modifications at all.. absurd and stupid..
3899	0	a	the game:  [cons] very rare updates, except when there is new cash shop items, which is really often. the frequency of new cashshop weapons shows the game weapon balance is .. lets say .. from non existant to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. repetitive, will get to know all of the game has to offer in under 1 hour.  [pros] One of the better player, clothing, vehicle costomization you can find. In game editor somewhat effecitve.  The gameplay:  [cons] pay to win, With a cashshop item, learn curve is non existant. repetitive 'missions' it pretty much boils down to a team death match in a different location on the map every time. Horrendous level design. Uber effective choke points renders knowing the map aka time spent in game, more important than your ability to land shots. voip is a must, require real life friends to play with you. no headshots, less lucky kills. less dynamics. steep and stable learning curve.   [pros] you get to drive cars. shoot guns wear fancy DIY textured clothings via in game editior 
3900	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.
3901	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.
3902	0	a	this game keeps on crashing and hanging i do not recommend it
3903	0	a	This game is terrible, when you try to do missions you get killed by people 50 times higer the level you are and they camp at the objectives. This game is not for new players or people who HATE grinding.   -50/10
3904	0	a	Not Getting Any Steam Achievement don't pop up.......
3905	0	a	Doesn't accept passwords, takes forever to load on SATA III SSD.
3906	0	a	This game is broken and it's getting more broke with every update. Admins ban anyone they want no matter what they did. The lag is apsolutely amazing. If you get frustrated very easily DON'T GET THIS GAME. On the other hand the game is very original and if it wasn't in the uncapable hands of gaymers first maybe it would have been an awesome game!
3907	0	a	0.01/10  This game is one of the worst 3rd person shooter ever made. The developers don't listen to the community and what the community wants in the game. The over-pricing of guns and clothes in the ARMAS market is rediculous (DON'T BUY ANYTHING WITH REAL MONEY). The server lag is insane and sometimes hard to deal with. Also, the amount of hackers you see is stupid and made me want to hack sometimes. The only good thing about this game is the customisation feature, but you have to pay for a premium to add more than like 10 decals to your car. This game is extremely pay to win, if you want anything good you have to pay with real money to get it.  Looking back now, I don't see any reason of how i could have played it for as long as I did.  I will never play it again.  
3908	0	a	Pay to win. So simple.  Was getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ until I picked up a free (for 30 minutes) rifle from the marketplace and suddenly it's like the good switch got turned on.  Not interested.   Would be a cool game if they just went pay to look good but it's just another cashcow. Steer clear.
3909	0	a	full of hackers
3910	0	a	I thought this game would of been good untill i download and it dosent even open!!!! i would like it if this was not bugged
3911	0	a	buggy as hell and doesnt want to load the game and if you do get in the game you might get about two min with the game before it crashes. i dont recommend this game to anybody.
3912	0	a	Nope nope nopeeee :D but i could be bais, there was too much lag for me to play it :) be cool if there was an australian server :)
3913	0	a	This game is a laggy, confusing, pathetic excuse for a game. Do not waste bandwidth or hard drive space on this game. It's not worth it
3914	0	a	I just... I couldn't. No, never. Don't play this, waist your time on something else.
3915	0	a	Pay to win game (with the weapons)! The system with the criminal and cops dont got the same balance. Your doing criminal things and the the cop-players coming from nowhere and kills you( every times!)
3916	0	a	Aims to be like GTA, but the system doesn't allow for that much freedom, so in order or it to be like GTA, they need to overhaul the whole game, so no, I don't like it.
3917	0	a	This game is simply terrible. The matchmaking sucks (newbies always get paired against veterans), the gear is temporary unless you shell out real money for it, the game won't leave you alone about upgrading to a premium account, and the hit locations are meaningless (you can snipe someone in the foot and it'll technically count as a headshot if they don't have armor). On top of that, botters are rampant throughout the entire game. Most everyone I've played against has at least an aim-bot and/or trigger-bot because they aren't good enough to actually play the game without hacks. The missions are totally bland, too. Every single one basically boils down to whoever can get to the objective location first, and then it's a camp-fest while waiting to murder the entire team challenging the same location.  The bottom line is that APB: Reloaded looked like a good idea on paper, but the execution is horrendous. The anti-cheat system is basically non-existent, as the engine believes botters to be players with pin-point precision (which, in reality, is virtually impossible). With no reliable way to control the cheaters in the community, there's really no point in playing the game at all unless you're with friends. Then you all can have a good laugh at how bad the game is. Skip it.
3918	0	a	LAGGIEST GAME EVER!!!!! THEY FIX THIS I'LL BE HAPPY. THEY DON'T WELL I WON'T PLAY THIS GAME EVER AGAIN!
3919	0	a	The plot is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, because there isnt really one, and the servers never â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING WORK!
3920	0	a	This entire game is based off of the classic 'MMO' grinding. This doesn't translate very well into a GTA 'cops 'nd robbers' setting. This game has so many flaws, 80% of my time playing this was just trying to get it open based on multiple launches. It's not worth the download time and the stress. Don't play this. Jesus christ, between the loading times and the god damned lag when driving a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing -CAR-, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE EASILY, MIND YOU, this game is a mess. It needs to be pulled into the backyard and shot OR redone from the ground up, which is something I -KNOW- won't happen. God damned. I'm never going to get this time back from my life.  I give it a ten because I'm a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idiot.
3921	0	a	The customization is awesome! The match making is terrible. I really really wanted to play this. I LOVE THE CUSTOMIZATION! I just can't take getting brutally murdered on every single mission and people telling me how all silvers need to go kill themselves. Playing vs other bronze players the game is fun. You are both new your weapons kind of suck and it's ok. The second you hit silver you will be massacred again and again and expect both your team mates and the other team (they can whisper you to tell you exactly what kind of an a*#hole you are and how your getting 'rekt!nub silver die!*) to berate you constantly. This makes starting out not only frustrating, but no fun at all. I don't want to be a pretty piece of cannon fodder for P2winners, hackers, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bags. It's kind of funny that the game's anti cheat thinger is called fair fight when nothing past bronze is even sort of fair. Do I want to spend the time watching myself die over and over again so that maybe I can unlock things that will even the score for a game that might (and probably should) die soon? No thanks. Also the hit detection is godawful. If you think shooting someone in the head should count for as many points as shooting them in the foot? You should ignore my review and play apb.
3922	0	a	I never got to try the game because it never would respond when it was in the middle of starting.
3923	0	a	Its beyond boring. no point to it. i tried to play it a billion times and i hated it every time. not worth the free download and space. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game.
3924	0	a	This is the absolute WORST FPS I've ever played.... you're reading the introductory text (ie., you don't even know the movement keys yet) and get slaughtered in the spawn area by some APB Troll.... then he thinks he's so funny that he does it another 20 times.  If I paid for this game, I'd be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. As it is, I'll simply uninstall it and go back to Combat Arms.
3925	0	a	This game had amazing character customization. purely amazing, the details for styling, and creating your own personal look, is something other games need, BUT, and it is a big but, like on madea. THE GAME SUCKS. the first 30 minutes are pretty entertaining, but after that, it is just a completley horrid experience. shame too. as i said, the customization was nearly perfect. i give it 1/10....no joke 
3926	0	a	i cant play it
3927	0	a	I'M FROM PLANET VEGETA
3928	0	a	this is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks 
3929	0	a	Doesn't work for my computer or anything. Sadly i was hoping it would be cool to play.. :(
3930	0	a	no start why??
3931	0	a	the game honestly sucks. Its pay to win and unbalanced in the Crimminals favor. they make money faster and when you add pay to win ontop of ythat making them earn more money and more experience it makes the game just no fun. Its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing annoying as hell. the hacker base is endorsed by G1 because they buy the mod and the money goes to G1 so theyre happy as long as the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ers make money.
3932	0	a	It's a pretty good game, but it's the BIGGEST PAY TO WIN I HAVE EVER PLAYED. For example, it takes a while to unlock the rocket launcher. I've played this game for days and haven't come close to getting the gun that can one-shot cars. People can go straight in with real money, buy a rocket launcher, then run around blowing people up when they are such a low level. It doesn't seem fair that the people playing the game like it should be played are getting crapped on by the people who run in with a wod of cash and buy everything in the game.
3933	0	a	This game is NOT noob friendly. in APB reloaded, there is no sign of matchmaking whatsoever. it just compiles a random clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of people to duke it out. which means if you're just starting out, you could easily be placed against someone who's been playing nonstop for months repeatedly. I tried to get on my feet in that game for 3 days, but every cent I earned went toward ammo or was lost in deaths to people who play nonstop and pay actual money for the good equipment.   also, I dare say that this is the single most infuriating game I have ever played. even more so than Call of Duty. I don't get angry easily, but this game angered me to the point where I threw my mouse across the room and shattered the damn thing. So, here's a warning. if you're angered easily, AVOID APB RELOADED  It's a shame, because the idea behind it had a lot of potential. I was really excited to see someone finally making a game like this where you could actually be the cop with custom cars and weapons. It had so much potential, but the absolutely terrible matchmaking and blatantly obvious pay to win strategy ruined the entire thing for me.  long story short: unless you're willing to spend an untold amount of hours on this game, all it's going to do is infuriate you. it's a gigantic avoid from me.
3934	0	a	I do not recommend this game. If you are beggner go do some misions some pro player will snipe you or kill u with rpg on sight. Best game i have ever uninstalled
3935	0	a	I am not able to play this game.Every time i try to play it i press start and it doesn't load the game. My friend has the same problem.I am really disapointed. ;{
3936	0	a	SO uhm, yeah. High level players versus people who literally just joined the game. so fair 
3937	0	a	So i hit play and all it does is takes me to their facebook page saying like me. HOW STUPID!
3938	0	a	the game won't launch despite i already update my Nvidia PhysX to the latest version
3939	0	a	never loads my people
3940	0	a	* Brutal to new players * Laggy and unoptimized * Rampent Cheaters that make life a living hell. * Inactive Devs and GM's * DDoS attacked frequently.  If GamersFirst Developers became more transparent and seemed like they cared about their customers I would come back to this game after they fixed everything. This is true with their other games like Fallen Earth.
3941	0	a	Now I can see that this game definitely had a lot of potential in the beginning, but the end product is a broken mess that is confusing, tedious, and repetitive. The major upside of this game is that the character customization is far superior to many other games. Other than that, there's hardly anything worth mentioning about this game. My advice: Don't waste your time, and certainly DON'T waste your money on this game.

3943	0	a	this game is like no other game thats i have ever seen befor this game has so many hackers so many glitches and so much profanity its a shame to call that a video game i was very interested in the game and was very very up set i couldnt progress because its such a mess in that game and i hope any parent that sees this game does not buy it for there child this game need to be banned. this is y people are being bullied and pushed around this game is garbage.   p.s. SUCH A SHAME
3944	0	a	its a really fun game, the world is expansive and you can customize the music, cars, clothes and many other things which is a pretty big plus.. but no matter how hard you work, its very oriented toward people who buy stuff in game, no matter how hard you worked for that machine gun by doing missions, you only get it for maybe a few days or a week, but if you buy it, its yours for good.  but ig your ok with that then this is your game, but I myself hate when someone a lower level blows me to bits with a machine gun and leaves me in the dust using a muscle car that goes double my speed, making it a quickly ending speed chase.  and even though it says I only played for an hour or so, I've had days of playing this game before I had it on steam, sad the say that it hasnt changed.
3945	0	a	After some time playing APB, and spending some money on 30-day premium account, I would not recommend the game. The game is full of hackers, the matchmaking is awful. Gold-rated players vs Bronze-rated players. The server lags every 5 minutes. The 'comunity' is full of annoying and toxic people. For new players, the game is non-friendly.  If you plan to buy guns, vehicles or stuff like that, for 30-day or lifetime, prices are way too high. I find the developers so greedy.   However, the game has a lot of customization chances, and the open world, free roaming and missions are good. But they don't justify the game itself.
3946	0	a	Used to be a great game years ago, but now it's complete ****.
3947	0	a	Just terrible. I played it for 20 mins and deleted it when I realised it's just a tacky rip off of GTA.
3948	0	a	Kind of a grind.
3949	0	a	It's a good enough game (Gameplay, Missions (kind of?))  But the one thing that let me down on this (now â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥) game?  The community. DDoSers / DoSers, Hacks &amp; don't get me â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing started on the micro-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing-transactions!
3950	0	a	The first impression is that you're in for an amazing experience. But the more you spend playing, the more you realise how much troublesome it is to play this game. Firstly, the servers are underwhelming. Secondly, the game is absolutely pay to win. I repeat, you WILL NOT be able to achieve ANYTHING WORTHWHILE in THIS DONKEY GAME unless you're willing to spend your whole monthly savings. A no from me.
3951	0	a	Pay to win.... simple
3952	0	a	I would not recommend this game to anyone, if I did it would be to light it on fire and then blow it up.
3953	0	a	Not the best free to play game.

3958	0	a	Not fun at all, many players in game are uber powered and all they do is look out for new players to kill over and over,dont recomend
3959	0	a	A typical G1 owned game, full of hackers. Just like Warrock they get a game and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it over just getting the quick cash. They dont care about the players and made it a pay to win game. Having played the old APB this just sucks. Don't waste your time on this game.
3960	0	a	Game sucked major â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GG pay2win, would rather play Hello Kitty Online Adventures, save your life and desk space and dont even bother installing this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. peace
3961	0	a	Graphics are good but its a complicated game u need 1 month or 2 to completely understand this game or complete training period.Go for dota 2,phantom recon ghost,team fortress or ghost multiplayer. ~Cheers

3964	0	a	Not that great.

3966	0	a	As soon as it was done installing, it would just show a small box and not the actual game so thats why I'm going to uninstall then reinstall to see if it works. If it does I'll send a Yes on recommending it, if it doesn't then I'm going to try to send a No on recommending it and go talk to someone about it.
3967	0	a	this is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. it runs in the background with no way to stop it which lags everything else out. it is classisfied by steam as running so you cannot play or delete it. DO YOURSELF A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FAVOR AND GET A DIFFERENT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME BEFORE YOU â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ UP YOUR COMPUTER PERMANENTLY
3968	0	a	I CANT START IT (windows xp) PRESS PLAY LOADING AND THEN NOTHING

3971	0	a	IT IS A TERRIBLE GAME DO NOT EVER PLAY IT!
3972	0	a	i hate this
3973	0	a	I actually DO NOT recommend this game. It is terrible. Its glitchy as all hell. The game originally launched with a lot of problems. Not sure what the new development team was doing the year or so they were preparing to launch the game, but the result of their work doesn't make it look like they were working much.
3974	0	a	Confusing objectives and unfriendly community that doesn't take the time to think 'Oh, maybe this person is new?' Instead, they just scream at you and insult you. Gameplay isn't really anything that special, and it has a P2W feel about it.
3975	0	a	I'm sure that the game is fun for certain people but, while i was playing it, I had an incredibly hard time gaining a feel for the game. I could not figure out what was going on throughout the entirety of my playtime. I've been told the beauty of this game lies in the customization, a feature i did not play long enough to achieve, but I don't feel like that would be able to make up for the shoddy gameplay that I experienced
3976	0	a	Here's my recommendation: that you AVOID this game, and REFUSE to pay any money towards the publishers: G1. The customization is great (well, what was left to GamersFirst by the original creators: Realtime Worlds, RIP), and the driving is funny in a Gmod-physics kind of way, but the combat is utterly deploreable. Biased towards the criminal faction, and favorable to those suckered into paying a monthly fee of around $9, this game is what gives 'Free to Play' a bad name. And as if that premium membership bonus (between x3 and x4 cash rewards for missions/activities, and faster leveling for unlocks) wasn't bad enough, but their marketplace sells items that, once bought, are not customizable, and many are exclusive to the real-money market. Seriously, a gun that looks like an AR but has the EXACT same secifications and performance as the in-game rentable AK costs $40. It's a $40 reskin. Marx isn't turning in his grave, he's weeping and saying 'I told you so!'
3977	0	a	Other than the really good customization features. You are up for a sketchy game. By sketchy I mean, there is no anti-cheat system, nor is there a proper 'Report abuse' feature. They don't care who or what you think is hacking. They just do whatever to buff or debuff weapons and more. The guns and most of the other features are locked unless you have premium. It's one those F2P games where you have to buy Premium in order to get the most out of a game. Of course, most games do the same, but for this game, Premium statuses make the game unbalanced. (This is my opinion and expressing why I wouldn't recommened the game).
3978	0	a	i could not even play as soon as i finished making my character it would not let me enter the world. Fix please i really wanna play.
3979	0	a	What a waste of HDD space. Stay far, FAR away from this game.
3980	0	a	I'm afraid that I found this game sparse on content, and without progression. You do not get to keep anything- only rent it for a time, and that means that in a few weeks, you are back where you started, regardless.
3981	0	a	Crap, absolute crap. Cars handle like roller skates, story is unimaginative.
3982	0	a	What a piece of crap. It was free to play and I somehow wasted money on this game. :P Actually, it was trying to install the game. never actually 'played' it.
3983	0	a	Pay2Win in every sense of the word, I can't really recommend it for anything besides playing with close friends.  Amazing customization though, so if you're into that, you might still get some fun out of it.
3984	0	a	NEVER PLAY THIS GAME. So laggy at the sight of another player, you just stop moving. Not even fun as a joke. I have never played a game that was so badly made, problems installing and playing. It also uses punk buster, the worst piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ software there ever was.
3985	0	a	Aim bot hax took this gam over!
3986	0	a	Complete pay-to-win. If you think this will be like GTA you will be sorely dissapointed. Save yourself the few gigabytes and don't bother with this game. 3/10
3987	0	a	I would recommend this game to a lot of people, but I will not! Just because there are too many cheaters since the F2P release...!
3988	0	a	This online game look like GTA.In fact,the gane just killing each other in a open world city.It's also buggy and boring.  Windroid's Recommend Score : 58/100
3989	0	a	I thought to myself why not to try it since it's free to play. However I was quite disappointed. The best part is sadly the character editor. 3/10
3990	0	a	this game sucks, windows defender blocking .exe, u cant skip intro screen -&gt; making my brain explode because the volume is over 9000, after downloading it says wrong installation pls deinstall -&gt; i not even played this game but hell it sucks
3991	0	a	Avoid this game like the plague. Horrible netcode. Horrible performance (Uses 1.5GB of RAM when minimized) and crap support. If you didn't like this in the beta, you definelty won't like it now. This game should have died when realtime died! - Overall score: 0%
3992	0	a	I really want to recommend this game, because there's so many things about it that are great, but overall it's just been way too hard to have an enjoyable experience with it.  The thing is that while the game has a lot of really cool systems to it, the massive amount of customization options, the GTA-style MMO gameplay, the massive potential for fun included in playing the game with friends, it's all entirely offset by the fact that the game's matchmaking is complete garbage. Four times out of five, you're matched up against opponents that are -way- higher rank than you, and often have weapons that far outclass yours, simply because they've paid a few bucks. This game completely embodies the 'pay-to-win' problem that a lot of Free to Play games encounter, and it's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ shame. When you're in a matchup against a guy who's more than five times your rank, and can kill you with three shots even if you've gotten the jump on him first, then what's even the point?
3993	0	a	This game is really a piece of trash. I was expecting something like Grand Theft Auto Online, but this is something totally different - it's boring, it's weird, like when someone tries to make Saint's Row, but boring Saint's Row, without the giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and stuff. And MMO, of course. And one does not simply create a game like this. Don't download it, you'll be uninstalling it in a few hours, maybe minutes... perhaps seconds.  Overall: 0/10
3994	0	a	This game isn't really new-user friendly. It handles much like GTA, but guns are unlocked based on your level, and you have to kill people do gain levels. They basically start you out with a stick and everyone else has rocket launchers. It's more fun to play with a friend, especially if you're just starting. Friends are more likely to put up with your learning curve than the community would.
3995	0	a	Awful, pay2win It's called reloaded, but it isn't much different from the buggy beta
3996	0	a	.....
3997	0	a	It may be free but not worth downloading its just not worth it in my opinion but look at some gameplay and see if its your sort of thing but from me 5/10
3998	0	a	i DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone because the sandbox qualitys are terrible i thought this was gonna be a gta BOOTLEG. The game is okay when you take out trolls,OP guns,paying real money,etc
3999	0	a	the game just goes off my screen but it says that i am still playing it even though i cany see it.
4000	0	a	Game was good when I first played now it's a glitchy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wreck driving system SUCKS matchmaking system SUCKS I made a cew criminal cause it had been so long I went into my first mission THAT SHOULDN'T BE IMPOSSIBLE and I got paired up against 3 high level players and me and a completely new person
4001	0	a	Generic third person shooter where people who've put more money into the cash shop than you will obliterate you instantly no matter what level you are, and where almost every item is temporary. Enjoy repeating the same missions over and over again. but relabled to get anywhere.
4002	0	a	A decent game to play, gets boring fast, so you will only play in short burts of up to 2 hours; then go back the next week. Don't expect to make friends on this game, everyone is a dik and if you want to have any fun, you will have to be one too. So just bring your steam friends, for a quick session of driving in vans and shooting random people out of the passenger door(s).
4003	0	a	if you like constant run ins with cheaters/aimbotters/wallhacking all that crap then this is the game for you, if not steer away from it they have punkbuster but it doesnt do anything cheaters run rampant and on the weekends they are ever present G1 doesnt do anything to stop them either or even try
4004	0	a	Well, after playing this game for a short amount of time, and I know you will say you haven't played that long, but it is very poorly put together, and not enough time was put into missions. They get extremely boring and it is very difficult to gain money. The money isn't the issue though, it's the ranking system. It does take some time to get used to, and it is not confusing, although it is time consuming. The marketing is not well put together as well. Very inconvinient. The driving mechanics as well as the shooting mechanics aren't the greatest either. Driving is very delayed when you want to turn, and shooting is very inaccurate due to large crosshairs, even when you aim in. All and all, I'd give this game a 6/10, mainly because of the graphics being so good for a free to play game and the idea. GamersFirst definetly have something started. They just need to finish it..
4005	0	a	If you want to have fun then this is the perfect example of a game not to play.
4006	0	a	game dosent even download Gamersfirst and they call there company Gamersfirst lol
4007	0	a	Good while it lasted
4008	0	a	Doesn't even launch, no point in getting. So many people have had this issue, waste of almost 5 total GB
4009	0	a	It's like second life but with a campaign.
4010	0	a	The concept seems to be 'an MMO-style GTA,' and essentially, it is.  In the beginning, when you learn what the game offers, it sounds like a truly great game, and it can be.  Keyword there is 'can.'  It is *EXTREMELY* difficult to get off the ground. The tutorial missions are near useless, and when you're thrust out in to the game world, expect to lose your first 10 missions. Badly. VERY badly.  If you expect to drive a car with any hope of control, prepare to be disappointed. The time between button-press and steering-response is EXCRUCIATINGLY long.  Driving requires awareness. Video game driving requires anticipation. APB Reloaded driving requires the ability to   PREDICT THE Fâ™¥CKING FUTURE.    Maybe you won't have this problem, but I sure did. And getting around without a car is cumbersome and time-consuming (probably because they didn't plan for you to HAVE to play the game without transportation).  All that being said, my opinions of the game not being what you'd call 'good', it *is* a free game. So, my recommendation: Download it when you have a stretch that you're gonna be on your computer for a while, and try it out.  Why? Because you, quite literally, have nothing to lose in this transaction.  Don't like it? No money lost.  I'm not gonna recommened this game, though, since I...well, hated it, but if you have a good enough connection to download the game while doing whatever your daily stuff is, might as well, right?

4026	0	a	I couldn't even play the freaken game because the stupid sky and screen of the game kept giltching and i couldn't even see. whatever you do save your memory and save your money. i would give it a 1 out of 10 if they could fix it. which might not even happen. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4027	0	a	i was playing a hour early and i went to get food i come back on and it sayed i was banned for no reason i did nothing to get this no hack not even â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ player off so how do i get banned for nothing and it is now one hour later gamerfirst i will not get any more of your games
4028	0	a	I recommended this game it's all up to you Mr/Ms. steam User.Well although the time I spent in this game is not much but i can tell that this game is pretty much hard without paying with real life money.You have to get up and try to suceed with a tiny pistol and rifle and your policxe style Nissan Micra while other use muscle cars and vans with rocket launcher.It's hard to complete some achievements without paying plus you can't kill anyone that pay cash with your toy gun.
4029	0	a	APB is a great Free to Play game, the main problem is Free to play in this case, is free aslong as you don't mind being dominated constantly by Gold Ranked pay to win players, over half the content is inaccesible to players who wish to have a free game. This also means you and your group of 5 people can be dominated by about 2-3 pay to win players, with the best Kevlar addons and high rate of fire, aimbot like guns. This may sound like rage which a large amount of it is. However it is also the truth, if you wish to freeroam without missions with friends its a great game, but as soon as those Pay to win players arrive, just search for a new server, or leave the game. NOT WORTH THE STRESS!
4030	0	a	This game's anti cheat/hack system is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.Kicks you out when ever you attempt to login b/c it thinks you are cheating. Not to mention this game is super glitchy. I can't even play for five minutes before it freezes or boots me out. 0/10

4034	0	a	:(
4035	0	a	Well I cant even play the game because when i click play the launcher appears then disappears, but it looks like a fun game i waited a year for this game to get better but it still does not work but after a while i will try again but for right now i don't think so
4036	0	a	Ya know...  I've played this game for a while and I've been going through the motions of the missions. I liked the concept but the lagging, other rude players, and hacking (Which I was surprised that it wasn't addressed by the Devs) then suddenly had it when I got tired of getting knocked on how bad I played. I came knowing that it was 'Pay to win' and wondered if that difference would lead to a better game now I know.
4037	0	a	Going to be honest game used to be good like 2 years ago now its pretty terrible G1 support is also terrible with helping most players and they ban legit players who are better then above average. Played this game since CBT and I personally have felt the ban hammer for 'Suspected use of third party software to give an advantage over other players.' (Note: I have never hacked in this game nor done anything that is borderline considering how much time and money I have spent on it I think it would be stupid to but I am Unbanned now) but to even think they are banning legit players is disgusting. Games not terrible its more the owners of the game and their staff although they take like 2 weeks to release a patch that is literally 'Fixed a bug where you could drop the objective and it will float 5m in the air.' and that is all. Most guns in the game are either OP and kill you instantly or suck and you can use an entire magazine and still not kill someone. Finally the game will have terrible FPS if you dont have a good computer. Bottom line is im not telling you to not give it a try but IMO If I had the choice of starting again in the games current state I would stay clear of it.
4038	0	a	To start off with, the game has its good parts and its bad parts, like every other game. But this game is not just like the others. I will start with the Pros. This game offers you the ability to customize clothing,cars,weapons as much as you want, and honestly, i haven't seen many games with so much customization. Its gameplay is one that will get you addicted. Now , for the Cons. Every one has heard of MMOs. They are supposed to let you customize and buy new content with in-game cash, and if you want to access some premium content to pay some money(for them to make some cash). This game has an incredibly greedy publisher, also known as Gamersfirst. They are all about money and they don't care about the players. The support is absolutely TERRIBLE. Their stuff added into the game is absolutely POINTLESS, as it adds more lag to the game and the framerate sometimes in a shootout can reach 2! For me, i have a great computer and high-speed internet, and it still happens. But it's not enough for this game. All these continuous patches make the game harder to enjoy, because it adds lag, as mentioned before. I've been playing this game for about 300 hours. I know that's not a lot, but i've added some cash into this for the premium, and i deeply regret it. I got my account hacked and when i contacted support all they said 'We will work on the case and we will inform you! Thank you for calling Gamersfirst!', and then they never got back to me with any news. I tried contacting again but they refused to help the second time. They didn't want to hear about it. Also the players in this game are acting like absolute garbage. You'll never get by without being criticized when you have a good score and you're owning the opposition. They will always say : 'You're a hacker!'; 'You're a noob!'; 'F*** YOU!'. In my opinion, and i think a LOT of you guys who have played this game, i think you will agree with me. THIS GAME IS GARBAGE!!
4039	0	a	It took me almost an hour to get this game to even work. When I finnally did get it working the 'next' boton was behind my start bar and unclickable. the window unsizable. Im sure it would be a great game if it was possable to actully get past the 'choose your faction' screen. at the very least make the window sizable or make the game full screen.
4040	0	a	Played this game within the first week it came out but quit less than an hour into it because it was simply too laggy to play. Tried playing it again earlier today and it's still too laggy to play. I have a decent spec computer and 100mbit internet.  My suggestion is to avoid the extreme load times and stuttering frames and laggy glitches by not installing this piece of garbage.
4041	0	a	So let's get this rolling.  This game is addictive as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ due to being just so much fun at the lower levels but when you progress your threat changes and you will be placed with much harder opponents. The problem is there is no required level for this threat, meaning low level players can reach the highest threat level and then they are for the most part â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. You face enemies that have so much stuff or spend real money on the game that you just get face rolled.   Which doesn't help the match making, that's broken as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. At late game you get placed into such unfair matches that it releases the devil inside you. Placing you in games with unbalanced amount of players or threat level. We were two silver threat levels playing against 2 highest level gold threat players and being facerolled.  Then there is the problem of Pay 2 Win. This game has the most OP Pay to win system I have ever seen. You can buy the max level guns and items at any level, meaning you get players just owning you at lower threats and levels. These guns can be obtained (Sort of) at the highest level but just think for a moment, low level players with end game guns....  Now for servers. The servers are for the most part fine, the problem is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing way the game uses the servers. Almost everything is server side, so lag? Tough â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. You're going to crash and backtrack the whole time, also the server side thing doesn't work for international players as they have delayed â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing everything. Delayed controls on vehicles, delayed hit detection, delayed death and damage. Making the game feel like a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  The Weapons in the game are for the most part good except for the OP Premium guns that are sold on the market. The guns expire every 10 days and they don't cost a high amount but the problem is that the Guns you pay â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money for also expire, although the period is 30 days instead of 10. So when you come back after taking a break from the game, you'll find out that you have no weapons and have thrown more money at the game to unlock those weapons that are required to even win matches.  The game's customization is simply amazing, the company that owns the game host events for artists to create new works of art for the game and if they win they get allowed to sell it on the premium store, but the problem here is you have to pay to be able to make anything. That's right, you have to pay for fonts, icons, decals and much more to be able to make something. Anyway to skip that part is to buy vehicles or clothes that are on the market and have been customized. Lastly there is the way this game makes you rage, with the lag and the pay 2 win style, the most anoying part is when you die, you get played a taunt from the enemy that can be really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing anoying. This game has made me rage so much on my friends that we stopped playing it.  In the end, I wonder why I even played this game for so long.
4042	0	a	just another P2W, being a criminal in real life it's cheaper than this laggy game full of aimboter players, so go on and use those $10000 that you're paying for this game and use them for a real gun.

4046	0	a	the game wont start so its usless to download
4047	0	a	When i joined this, it was fun, but it forced me to have to buy more ram just to play, but even then i lagged during any battle..  reason i dont reccomend this: SUPER cpu heavy, it lags bad if you dont have a serious up to date graphic card or more then 8gb ram, seems they put alot into graphics which causes older computers or people who dont buy computers every year not able to play it.  i still login from time to time, but it became un-fun when it was nothing but trolls bashing your car/truck into walls with garbage trucks, or children screaming on the voice system just to annoy you.  i dont reccomend this if you have a older cpu, or cant handle the graphics, also if you cant deal with kiddy trolls bashing you every 5 mins not allowing you to do anything.
4048	0	a	Imagine a game like GTA, but the graphics are about on par with Saints Row2. the Character customization is awesome, the vehicles drive like . . . like . . . like a pat of butter on a hot skillet. I don't know if that gets the idea across. The controls are hell. Sure, the combat holds up, but you are only going to be playing with 3 other people. there are no OTHER criminals in the city, there are no OTHER cops in the city . . . it's just you and who ever is logged on playing cops and robbers VERY intermittently. The game sounded really cool in concept but they FAIL to deliver. This is the multiplayer side of a poorly crafted game with no single player activity in a lifeless city full of cowardly ragdolls. I never figured out how to open a door without kicking it open. But I must say, props on the character customization; we know where the money went.
4049	0	a	absolutely not, but it is fun... with friends
4050	0	a	This game, haha, let me get started. This game is a good game, I like the concept of the game, but it is purely, Pay to Win. The tutorial helps you little to none, I had a hard time figuring out how to even change cloths, it's also REALLY buggy. Besides after spending 15 hours on one character I got banned by Punkbuster for having, 'A Bad Driver' on my computer, this game in my opinion is a waste of time and space.

4054	0	a	I remember when they announced this Game, i was very excited, i mean who wouldnt u could make a clan with your friends, run around the city on customed cars and clothes make gangs catch bad people. Ect. well the game didnt live to anyones expectatives, it started as a pay to play after a few months became free to play. enough said.
4055	0	a	I managed to get a few hours playing this game, and what I found out to my content, was very sad. This game was very fun in the beggining, it had nice graphics, the game play was fun, and I thought it was going to be a very fun and good game. A few more hours of gaming and I learned that the only way to actually get anything is with real money, THIS IS A PAY-TO-WIN GAME, what pay-to-win generally means is that the only way to get stuff or be good in the game is to buy stuff with real money. After I kept playing I saw that the community was complete trash, too. As well as the greedy producers of this game. I do not recommend this game for any reason, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money playing the game and googling things because no one is opt to help you.
4056	0	a	Quite possibly the most hostile, arrogant and rude player base of any game I have ever played. That alone is enough never to play this game for me.  Besides the player base, the game has very little content. It's all PvP missions and with the low server populations, there aren't that many people that play so the world feels very empty.  Then there are the rampant cheaters with aimbots, etc. The developers are doing their best to combat it, but you can see messages from FairFight banning people every few minutes. That is very telling that there are so many when the server population is maybe 50 people or so.
4057	0	a	Really Bad Game i Played 2 Years And after I retired APB... After a year Today The im Trying to Get into My Account that i had And in-game i Typed my Email Address And My Password After That i waited for while And its wrote me that im Not to Old To Play APB.... And after That i asked For Help in the Gamers First Forums And they Just told me: 'To get out of here your not old enough to play this game.' really Shame And Bad Game it was Great Expiriance But now Bad Game Not Reccomended... 
4058	0	a	i used to play this before it was free to play and now its free to play yeah right if you dont pay for good guns your going to have a bad time as every ones gun is better then yours you can shot them a lot they wont die they shot you 3 times your dead and its always with guns you buy with real money so unless you pay you wont play trust me
4059	0	a	UPDATE, yeah well it's good game in a way if there not was so much PAY TO WIN over it + ever high is most time always a camping noob or a run away or just dont know how to attack or always wait on you to attack so more or less, most golds dont have any balls at all or just only sniper wtih a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing noob nano or some other armas noob weapons and yeah i have been really good to play this game a time but now i only play wtih friends more or less for after 2 years this game is all about PAY to WIN now and no longer about skills X( it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sad and yes as you can see i have played close to 2000hours and it's more for i played befor it was on Steam so i say give one try and if it sucks than just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it side ways ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- if you like GTA 4 you need to play this for it like GTA 4 in MMO just of cause you can lvl up and unlock things but you can close to customization all the way you want! :D for me it's one of the best game ever!

4066	0	a	All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is a game that invokes many feelings. Off the top of my head, I can name relentless rage, grueling dissapointment, and cocky pride worthy of a guy that just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed Ariana Grande.  APB is a great concept. The backstory behind it is very deep, and the entire caracterization of the city of San Paro(however unoriginal that name might be) is very detailed and well done. It doesn't draw black and white lines: it's all a thick mist of grey, and it certainly asks you a question: are the oftentimes corrupt, control-obsessed vigilantes right? Or is it ethically correct to leave the city to the self-proclaimed renegades and anarchists, however chaotic and destructive they might be?  Remember, I'm talking about the CONCEPT here.  Because the realization of said concept is about as clear as a snowstorm in the deep ocean. The backstory and personality of the contacts and city is only presented by tedious text, mainly in the form of emails that most people just delete, or don't even bother to open. I even asked a friend, that has 20 hours clocked in the game, what the Enforcers were: he thought they were just straight-up police officers. That's just how bad the story is brought to the player.  Now for the gameplay. The core is good: Reloaded Productions managed to deliver a good third-person shooter, with interesting weapons and playstyles. The smart player that uses tactics will more often than not have an advantage over the kid that has spent countless dark nights crouched in front of his PC playing Call Of Duty, while perfecting his aim and surviving on Red Bull and Cheetos. However, like almost everything in this King Kong-sized dissapointment, this is ruined by two reasons:  1: The lag. Oh god, the lag. Unless the monthly cost for the servers is 3 bucks plus a cute picture of a cat, I cannot possibly wrap my head around how bad they are. Driving feels like standing on one foot. On a stick. Which is balancing on a banana held by a blind monkey with Parkinson. Often, during a unexpected encounter with a hostile player in the back alleys of the Financial District, I have either died because half of my shots didn't register, or I have won because my opponent's gun wasn't raised-which is a clear indication that some serious lags are going on.  2: The players. Sadly, the smart tactician is a long extinct species in San Paro, and the streets are now ruled by people such as 'Pu$$ySlayer69', 'lole_u_got_buttâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed' and 'UMAD BRAH??11?'. I am seriously not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you right now, I have seen all three of these names ingame.  Dare to be good, and you'll be called a dirty hacker. Dare to be even slightly worse than either your teammates or your opponents, or equip a weapon they dislike, and you'll be called n00b, â™¥â™¥â™¥, and come to the realization that most of these people have had sexual intercourse with your mother, or that they wish you to do the same.  There are quite some topics I haven't covered, such as the hackers, which constitute, based on other people's calculations, 9,7% of the players. An alarming number, but hard to confirm, so I will leave it there. There is also the company known as GamersFirst. Sadly, these people seem to identify 'Gamer' as 'Man with a lot of money and no need for a honorable fight'. For excruciating prices, you can buy certain weapons that will shred through any average player. (Note that I'm not saying all of them are OP: a decent chunk are either reskins, or equally powerful as the in-game weapons.) The excuse 'you can get it in game too' is true, because you DO unlock modifications and bonuses as you go, but I myself have clocked over a hundred hours and all I got was a useless magazine mod and a slight increase to marksman zoom.  The customization is unrivalled, though. I have tried to find a game, ANY game, that has better character creation or vehicle customization, but to no avail. Shame, because this pearl just had to be incrusted in the (mostly) dried up turd that is APB.  TL;DR: APB: Reloaded is a great concept, that was insufficiently realized by Reloaded Productions, and completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on by GamersFirst, after they took over the game. You could of course take a look, because, hey, it's free, but greedy business ideals have screwed over the concept so bad that the game is now singing it's dying song.
4067	0	a	I ignored APB for a long time, but due to a lack of other games I tried it. Generally, it is a solid Multiplayer PVP Game and makes fun for a short period time, but it has too many negative aspects in my opinion.  Pro's:  -Kind of GTA online clone.  -You can play and level Cops and Criminals.  -The design option is very big and funny. You can spend hours creating Vehicles, Style etc.  -Nice Cities with good spots and nice surroundings.  Con's: -As always in such games there is a ton of aimbot users most on criminal side in my opinion, wich ruins balancing totally in many missions. -Missions get very boring after a couple of days, cause they are always the same. Its only 4-5 different mission types on each side. -Most of the random players are not cooperative and not playing in team. They dont use chat and running like chickens into the other teams. Very frustrating when you have highlevel players and premade teams against you.  -For such a little online game it has way too many lags, what makes combat sometimes too stressy.  -The loading time is way too long. It needs up to 5 min. to get into the game, and you can not do anything else at this time cause the launcher makes your saystem slow, otherwise the game crashes. Thats not a resource problem its the simple game client.  -BUT Worst thing is the Pay to win! faction. Get better guns and bonuses from the shop or get 50% more than all other players. WTF...Without premium this game is nearly not playable. For example with premium I did level 4 Factions in one day to max, without it I did not even get one of them two levels up and got so much less money, that I can't get any better weapons.   After a week of playing alone and with freinds, I can only say...In the end you have to do frustrating and boring Mission farming....the design option is funny and fight can be thrilling sometimes, but after a couple of missions even that doesnt make it better. And thats the point where I stop playing such games.  If you like playing games where free to play means 'Counter strike' with frustrating and boring farming 80% of the time, and if its not bother you that a game has so many aimbot players, try it, otherwise leave it be and do something better with your time.     
4068	0	a	Terrible performance on AMD graphic cards. Lots of memory crashs and couldn't find any help in the forum for my problems. Game looks on max settings almost like on minimum due to a lack of optimization. If it runs well on your system good for you but if not invest a lot of time in trouble shooting...
4069	0	a	It's so good it's bad
4070	0	a	if you are from egypt dont download this game because there is no world is near t you so you cannot play you will just be able to custom a characters
4071	0	a	A horrible pay to win 3rd person shooter
4072	0	a	If you want to have fun then this is the perfect example of a game not to play.
4073	0	a	I played this game before it's official relaunch. However back then the game could barely run on any systems. Now after playing it on the relaunch only makes this title no justice. As it's full of cheaters and hackers with aimbot and wallhack. The game itself has awsome graphics for it's time and nice visuals. Somewhat large ``worldsÂ´Â´ to raom in tho they are 2 diffrent parts of the city of San Paro. But as said the game is now full of cheaters and hackers making this titel nothing worth playing. 
4074	0	a	You ever wonder what it's like when you mix elements such as Massive Multiplayer online capabilities and Great free-roaming environments together? Heh, me too... You might want to check any game other than this one. So, go on, get out of here before your elders see you desacrating your family honor...
4075	0	a	this game SUCKS

4078	0	a	A glorified, pay to win version of cops and robbers in which to kill someone you have to run around like a madman and throw explosives at anything that moves. also, your guns do as much damage as flicking a pea.
4079	0	a	Can't play this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game for more than 2 minutes without it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing crashing. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Waste of my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time and PC space.
4080	0	a	This game feels like the developers spent a lot of time and money on. Unfortunately, it also feels like they spent 99% of their time and money on customization and the other 1% on gameplay. This game doesn't get much from me.
4081	0	a	I was exicted when I first heard about this game coming out, back before they cancelled it. I'm not sure who picked up the ball and finally released it as 'reloaded'... but I gotta say I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who isn't a diehard fan of Grand Theft Auto. Or if the diehard fan of GTA were to be insulted by this game really, but if your looking for online interaction with your fellow GTA fans, just play GTA online with their latest release.
4082	0	a	Classic game. But you don't want to put any money on it.
4083	0	a	if you like tutorials that take 3 hours you will love this game
4084	0	a	This game is nearly dead... Only a few hardcore players left plus the server latency makes this game impossible to play (completely ignoring the p2w aspect).
4085	0	a	Dislike It is so laggy its not my laptop not myversion of windows its the game it self
4086	0	a	I'm actually considering reinstalling this.  I think I have a new form of autism

4088	0	a	Terrible matchmaking...nuff said
4089	0	a	Id say it was fun to play and uninstall but the game wont even load properly dispite multiple attempts on several different methods of download. If your looking for a game that doesnt load properly then this is the game for you!
4090	0	a	it's not really working for me

4094	0	a	One Word:LAAGGGGGG!!!!!
4095	0	a	I had heard nothing but good things about this game, decided to try it... couldn't delete it fast enough.  â€¢ Character Custimization: Beyond slow. Unless I randomized it, I wasn't able to create jack s**t for my character. â€¢ In Game: I watched as my boyfriend got in game (finally), only to struggle to find where a 'locker' was located with his clothes he had just bought....ONLY to discover that everything he had just spent money on wasn't even there.   IMO this could have been something great, it just seems little effort was put in to it.
4096	0	a	the game:  [cons] very rare updates, except when there is new cash shop items, which is really often. the frequency of new cashshop weapons shows the game weapon balance is .. lets say .. from non existant to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. repetitive, will get to know all of the game has to offer in under 1 hour.  [pros] One of the better player, clothing, vehicle costomization you can find. In game editor somewhat effecitve.  The gameplay:  [cons] pay to win, With a cashshop item, learn curve is non existant. repetitive 'missions' it pretty much boils down to a team death match in a different location on the map every time. Horrendous level design. Uber effective choke points renders knowing the map aka time spent in game, more important than your ability to land shots. voip is a must, require real life friends to play with you. no headshots, less lucky kills. less dynamics. steep and stable learning curve.   [pros] you get to drive cars. shoot guns wear fancy DIY textured clothings via in game editior 
4097	0	a	The gameplay itself can be summed up as a pretty-looking timesink: It does a good job of drawing you in, but between large loading times and rather grindy gameplay it struggles to keep you there.  But I've found myself spending hours just dicking around with the various character/outfit/vehicle/logo customisation editors (and there is a LOT of customisation you can do in this game), so there's that I guess.
4098	0	a	I don't reccomend as it is right now. But for those of you who were with it when the beta began, it's hard to get away from. It's like watching the beautiful development of a piece of art, only for it to break down, get handed to someone else, and tarnished. People now look at it like, 'what is that', we look back and say 'something that used to be good.' Problems with the game- -EVERYTHING YOU MAKE WITH THEIR CUSTOMIZATION TOOLS BELONGS TO THE COMPANY-THIS INCLUDES ORIGINAL DECALS, SONGS, CARS AND CLOTHING DESIGNS-WATCH WHAT YOU CREATE. ONCE IT'S SAVED, IT'S LOST. YOU CANNOT USE SAID DESIGN, DECAL, SONG IN ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL USE WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. -Overpriced clothing on the market-We asked for new clothes to wear, they gave us what we wanted-with a price of course(we've got 2 new contacts(what allows players to level up) that have yet to be released, and it was because they 'didn't have enough stuff made for them yet'.) -Graphics are CPU heavy, not GPU heavy. -RAM monster -Ingame matchmaking has yet to be fixed, higher skilled players stomping lower skilled players in the lower skilled players servers. -ARMAS(the commercial store for the game) prices are way too high and misaligned. -Old assets from the previous game before it was revived are refixed and brought back as products on armas for even higher prices. -Servers tend to blank out every now and then. -sub-par cheat detection services. Meaning you'll see cheaters a bit more than usual compared to other games.(its literally the standard punkbuster package. )  Pros- -Ridiculous replayability-Like I said, I've been around since the beta when the game relaunched. And it's got me hooked because I know how the game played before all this stuff started happening. Still trying to walk away from it, but it's a hard battle. -Full Customizaiton-Provided you pay the dough for about 180 dollars per year worth of 'Premium Membership'. Without it, you'll get a taste of said customization. -Unique gameplay-Yes, it's a shootemup, but it's different-The city is your waiting and matchmaking lobby, and your battlefield. -Everyone is different, and has their own unique identity, unlike other MMOs.  And that's about it. new guys, turn around and walk away, maybe come back at the end of the year, things might get fixed then. Old guys, lets try to get the hell outta here.  EDIT-I forgot one more con, the community can spew enough drama to run a spanish soap opera out of business at certain times. So If you do decide to play this game, walk in with a thick skull and be prepared to deflect some crap.
4099	0	a	This game is a brilliant idea but out of my short play time i found this game laggy and annoying all I wanted to do was free roam online then kill other players, when i was playing I was shooting a guy that was online did'nt hurt him what so ever then he shot me and i died its really annoying. So i recomend that if you have a really good computer play this game if not get another.
4100	0	a	Still Looks very glitchy not good.
4101	0	a	It sucks for anyone not runnin top of the line systems, its laggyu hacked hardcore and by far the worst game iv ever played 
4102	0	a	it is a Pay To Win game
4103	0	a	pay 2 win and terrible community
4104	0	a	Wow, it took hours of installing/uninstalling stuff, manual registry cleaning just to get it started. F*ck this mess
4105	0	a	Alright, so I downloaded this in 2 hours. I was all happy about playing. Started playing, I loved customization, but then, when it came to playing, it was horrible, Enforcers are OVERPOWERED, with the stun guns, it's impossible to play. Don't waste time. Play some real things instead.
4106	0	a	Dont let the 35 hours fool you, I've been playing for some time long before the game has been out on steam.  Probably the greatest character customization I've seen to this date, players progressively unlock premade designs or simple shapes they use to design their own, it all depends on a players imagination on how much or what their character is wearing, along with how it all looks on them, the same goes for vehicles.  Weapon and vehicle viriety isn't all that bad, you're given some basic weapons and can later aquire some with mods and some with open slots for mods which have their own ups and downs; But weapons that players can pay real money for arent available to other players; some which, while not completely better than others, the situation they cover are more common than not, You're given a small Sadan but later on you can aquire different, faster, stronger, higher storage capacity cars and some for up to 4 people can shoot out of while on the move.  Player base wise, the game seems to consist of nothing but GIFTs, short for Greater Internet â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥wad Theory, in which a Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥wad, expect to get a bunch of vile /whispers because someone that cant aim for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ misses point blank with a high power sniper rifle with a slow rate of fire and you can nicely ventilate them with an automatic assault shotgun.  Driving in the game is rather floaty and awkward there is tad of a delay between the command and the vehicle doing the action. Guns have great sound but shooting pretty much forces players to aim down sights or in this game 'marksmanship mode' even in small street alleys at all times unless its an smg or some pistols, Time to kill in the game feels rather quick, dying between two or five hits depending if the weapon is a powerful hitter or a bullet hose, that along with the lack luster accuracy even in marksmanship mode means players wil spray entire magazines into each other until someone dies and getting a nice little whisper from the other player that you're a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ or a hacker.  Finally the game has a sadly pants-on-head â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ way of choosing which server or 'district' you're forced to enter and who your enemies and allies are. A players Rank increases constantly, this would be your constantly progressing level and your Threat Level is how challenging the game perceives you, devided into Green, Bronze, Silver and Lastly Gold. the latter is sadly what the game keeps in mind about a player, districts are mainly devided by your Threat Level, so imagine a Golden Threat Rank 25 up against a Golden Threat Rank 150.   The game has a nice soundtrack, you can even play music from your MP3 library in the game if you wish, and players with that song can also hear it playing, you can also make a nice little 8-16 bit tune that will play for the player you've killed and play at the end of a round if you're the MVP.  All in all, if the game wasn't chock full of immature â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, guns that aren't accurate unless you're using the one sniper rifle available in marksmanship mode, crouched and still and player characters that die in 2-5 shots with no headshots to count I'd still play it.
4107	0	a	One of the best examples of a down right PAY 2 WIN game. Don't let my playtime fool you, I've been playing this game from the day it went F2P.  *Driving is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, due to horrible delays, it's do-able but certainly not enjoyable. *Firefights are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ due to horrible gunplay, It felt like Fallout3 all over again, see a nice gap you can shoot through? Nope, wall. *Collision is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Car is coming right at you, jump out of the way, it clearly hits the wall, dead. *The community is one if not THE worst community I've ever had the misfortune of being a part of.  The matchmaking/District select... You decide to play APB, soon you rank up to Bronze and feel pretty good about yourself, you look through the weapons list and see some cool Rocket Launchers and Grenade Launchers, and some very powerful cool looking guns! It'll take you weeks of playing before you can get those. You join a nice bronze District and decide to do some missions. Oh, look, 3 enemies. 1 bronze and 2 silvers (which have their own District, the Silver district).  Bronze number 1 has the starting assault rifle, the STAR. Silver number 2 has a Scoped N-tek rifle Silver number 3 has a cool looking Rocket Launcher  Golds (highest ranked) play on Silver servers. Silvers play on Bronze servers And Bronze players (the ''noobs'') can hardly rank up due to constantly being harrased by high leveled weapons.  And than, there's the people who try and get DE-RANKED so they can join Bronze servers. Due to GOLDS not being able to join BRONZE servers, they try and get themselfs DE-RANKED so they can have fun killing some ''noobs'' with their automatic grenade launchers and 1 shot kill modded sniper rifles.    The Devs are lazy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who obviously do not care about the game itself, and only care about the money. Releasing a new RESKINNED, and I repeat, RESKINNED weapon or vehicle, with new name each week. Instead of trying to fix the MANY MANY MANY MANY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing problems inside the game.  The game is a gigantic Bugfest. I'm finding glitches/bugs I encountered years ago.   See a Bronze with a Golden Scoped N-TEC and call him out on it, expect a ''YoumadcuzUbad''. I'd go as far as to say that the community is worst than that of Call of Duty's. Of course, not everyone, but expect the majority to be complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Than there's the hackers. Hackers everywhere. Every few games, you'll encounter a hacker. Call them out on it? ''YoumadcuzUbad''. While obviously hacking (aimbotting, wallhacking, no-recoil hacking) It's become so common you don't even have to call it out anymore, nor bother to report as I'm sure they don't care either.   I always try to find fun, in games like these. The fact is, you won't have fun unless you pay for one of those indestructible vans, CLEARLY overpowered weapons, you won't get far.   3/10, if you're new and interested in trying APB:Reloaded, go straight ahead, its worth playing at least once, I'll give it that. But don't expect as much as the screenshots show. The people saying that the game is not P2W, are the people who have spent money on it.

4115	0	a	A run of the mill third person shooter disguised as a free roam gta style type game, the world is dead, theres nothing to do but objective based missions against other players the only thing this game has is its customization. Not to mention this game defines the meaning of pay to win.

4118	0	a	I wouldn't rcommend this game to anyone due to the incriminating fact that it takes atleast an hour to setup your character and it hard to navigate through the selection screenes.
4119	0	a	Fun game but pay 2 win and hacks are everywhere
4120	0	a	It Is A Game That My Computer Has Problems With.  &gt;:(
4121	0	a	This game has a lot of potential when it leaves it's alpha state, but for now, it's clunky, confusing, and unforgiving. Dong not expanded.
4122	0	a	Game won't load. But I wouldn't say its bad. Just putting thumbs down because it won't start up.
4123	0	a	this game Horrable and Broke DONT PLAY IT! Unless you enjoy rage quiting...  Has some interesting ideas but fails to stand up on them
4124	0	a	Good idea, bad execution. It was interesting at first having a GTA clone MMO but it was ultimately really boring with not a lot to do. To top it off, you only get a few days with a certain gun that you purchased with in-game currency, first time I saw that in a game and didnâ€™t like it.
4125	0	a	This really is a poor game. The sheer difficulty of leveling up without paying is just unbelievable. Matches are unbalanced; I was often put against high level players despite being new to the game. Furthermore, the ammount of things you have to pay for just to get certains skins and modifications makes this one of the worst freemiums out there. Car choice is rubbish, the weapons system is very poor, you have to pay per week to own even the most basic guns and the lack of servers means sometimes I simply couldn't join. What an awful, awful game.  2/10
4126	0	a	Not so good game in my opinion. Although it has a very deep character creation system and you can make chicks by your own taste. Graphics are cool, but very laggy. Servers are good. But there are way too many criminals. It's like enforcer is dying. I have stopped playing due to it's pay to win nature. Get this if you are rich low-life gamer.  PS: There is a nude character exploit.
4127	0	a	Go and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your self with the nvidia phisyx
4128	0	a	game sucks. it doesnt even load up for me and for some reason everytime I wanna play the game it has to install everything again which takes about 2 minutes. Just play Killing Floor 2 instead people this game is horrible
4129	0	a	Major hackfest + pay to win in every way possible, it used to be a great game but the devs got greedy... avoid at all costs if you wish to keep your sanity in check.
4130	0	a	I did not recommend this game it's Pay to win
4131	0	a	This game must be a joke. I'm sorry but it's bad at all.
4132	0	a	the game is really fun but its ruined by how badly they want you to spend real money on the game. in order to get anything decent or cool you need to pay money for god damn points. you can only have 2 decals on your car if u want more u need to pay. character stuff u need to pay. f that. basically this game should be called money waster simulator. if they get rid of the money and make a way to get those stuff then 8/10.
4133	0	a	Game is fun...for a while then it just goes down to who pays more and has the better weapons. You cna kinda try to defend yourself but in the end. P2P &gt; F2P
4134	0	a	worst game ive ever played, the trailers look amazing but that is nothing like the game DO NOT DOWNLAOD 
4135	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4136	0	a	Its a free to play game, it's the same as all the others.
4137	0	a	It's fun, but it never got the finish it needed to be a truly great game. At this point, I would say wait for GTA V for PC. It's got similar gameplay, but GTA V is just much better in every conceivable way.
4138	0	a	This game is a pay to play type of game, when it first came out before I had steam the game was fun. But now its disappointing to say the least. I am sure if you had plenty of spare money to just throw at the game then it would be fun again. Not to mention, that people are rude. Even people who are 'supposed to team with you' they will do whatever it takes just to mess up the game or mission' needless to say... I dislike it. It is free however. Definitely wouldnt waste hard earned cash on it though.
4139	0	a	APB Reloaded is personally one of my favourite game. You can customise your character and your car! The guns are quite well-balanced.  However, there are many issue that is a hinderance to the game. Such examples will be unstable latency where if you stay in a country far from the server, you will not be able to move your character and shoot smoothly as people who stay in the country that has the server. Another problem is the premium guns where some free-players and beginners will find themselves in a serious disadvantage compared to premium players who has wide range of guns suited to their situations.  APB is one of those games where it feels good to play at first, but as times goes on, you will find yourself in a battle of keeping your interest alive of playing the game.  I give this a 5/10.   -Kiro
4140	0	a	i hate this stupid game i got 6 accounts banned with 5.000$ wasted on them. dont try to play this game and gamersfirst is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all they do is just steal money and bann yourr acc. I recommend you guys not to get it and btw i have never hack in my apb account in none of them and boom! This account has been blocked (10008) I LOST 6 ACCOUNT because of this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tards they make allot of money because of their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t
4141	0	a	This game is CRAP seriously i wasted 1090 hours on bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the missons are the same , people are actually hacking , fairfight banning random people for being good and PAY TO FU=KING WIN is bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ its more like pay to lose and get banned
4142	0	a	the game wont start!
4143	0	a	Tried jumping back into the game but got error after error after error trying to log in and play.  Don't know what you guys are doing but something this buggy should not be present in a 3-4 (?) year old game.
4144	0	a	This game is absolute disaster, it had multiple years to fix it. But it did squat but make p2w weaponry. This game is not worth it, PRERIOD.
4145	0	a	To be honest, if you wanna enjoy this game be prepared to spend at least 300 dollars more on it. The average is 1500 dollars.  Enjoy your pay to win free to play game.
4146	0	a	This game is full of ****. They rip you off of all of the money that you pore into this game. I spent some money on it and I never got my G1 credits.
4147	0	a	Horrible game and company dont waste your money...both me and a friend got banned for absolutely no reason...we hadnt even PLAYED the game in over a year, suddenly we get on and their fairfight system bans us the second we log off? thats cool.  I spent like 3-400$ on this game, never playing their games again.  Email them try to follow up, and they basically say 'that sucks'  Started playing the game(looking over emails here), on 11/2/2012, never made it out of silver, never got any crazy stats with any of my weapons, i was better with some that others obviously but eh.  Then after almost 2 years of completely ON AND OFF play(mainly BECAUSE of hackers running around in the game), my friend gets on tells me about the fairfight system, and how he has not seen any hackers since, i get excited i hop on, play literally 1 mission log off and boom.

4148	0	a	It was once a good game, now broken by bad devolopers, bad matchmaking, and greedy developers.
4149	0	a	First impression bit sloppy Guide Player Base Seems like League of Legends Kids start screaming and flaming the moment it aint going in their favor and come up with petty insults overal the game's garbage
4150	0	a	this game does not run its a ripoff
4151	0	a	Ok... APB Reloaded is a peculiar game. It's fun and completely awful all at the same time. The most controversial aspect of this game is it's usage of the Free-to-play model, a significant change from it's original incarnation as a subscription based game. However, this model always begs the question: Do you actually have to pay money to play this game against other paying players? In this case, the answer is unfortunately a resounding 'Yes!!!' Using in-game money received from beating missions (which I have significant issues, as you'll read momentarily) only unlocks weapons for 10 days. Additionally, not all weapon types are available for purchase using the in-game money. Some of the most powerful weapons in the game (the OCA 'Whisper,' for example) are only available for purchase using G1 credits -- otherwise known as real money. This type of F2P model is horribly unattractive to me. If you offer a game for free, don't restrict the fun to the people that play.
4152	0	a	It is a pain to download!
4153	0	a	I played this game just a bit, and I realised that there was no point on installing it. It's unbalanced and boring as hell.
4154	0	a	I used to play this game alot, must have spent over 200 bucks on content since the first run of this game back when it first came to F2P. hmmmm. $200, F2P..... something doesn't sound right here.....
4155	0	a	Rip off of Saints Row. Enough said...
4156	0	a	It wont start up. :I Plus I saw videos and the graphics and stuff look pretty bad. I can start the game up everytime I do it doesnt work. :I
4157	0	a	i try to loggin but it didnt work
4158	0	a	Spent '9.8 hrs' on this game, apparently. Only to figure out that my computer can't play it.
4159	0	a	Excuse my last one but now, I hate this now... It used to be great fun. Bought a Shotgun, a crappy auto shotgun. Won a few scraps. Earned enough money to bid money for a well created Cerberus Jacket. Got a Robo-Cop kill theme. Watched a few people role-play. Had fun in general.  But now, now it's all gone down in a spiral. I used loved to play this game, the customisation, the role-playing from time to time. In truth, I really, really, really dislike (absolutely hate) this game. But the reason why I play it? I play it in hopes that it will be back the way it used to be.
4160	0	a	This game is a disease  ...the uninstall button is the vaccine  1/10 would uninstall again
4161	0	a	horrible, i hate it honestly.
4162	0	a	If you trade legendary items you get banned for scamming. So either buy it with ingame money or don't trade weapons at all.
4163	0	a	Fun to play but the launcher crashes so much you will rarely get to play
4164	0	a	either baltimore or detroit simulator 2015
4165	0	a	start game rank you high look to buy a gun buy one gun perm $30 -10/10 dont feed their money hording.
4166	0	a	...
4167	0	a	p2w so hard, however I wouldn't even recommend this to you p2w kids cause the people not paying are hackers. the little bit that's untainted by the greed of the first 2 groups is broken or just not good. has the potential to be awesome but it's not gonna happen
4168	0	a	I am sick i this shity game because ost of the robbers are hackers useing thier aim bot and it so easy for them to get money and who idea was it to have a rocket launcher thats thing is too over powered  Fix this game  JarJarGamer
4169	0	a	Before, this game was great. Good community, good updates. Now it's the complete opposite.  Unless you want to play the same thing over and over, same mission and what not, go ahead. But it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Usually the maximum of 7 people on fighting districts. The only thing that's good is the exit button.
4170	0	a	i never played it and i could never have played for all the errors that happen
4171	0	a	Had high hopes.  They were crushed.  Crushed into non-existence.  -69/10
4172	0	a	It's fun without a doubt, but the player base is practically dead.  Any remaining players have the best gear and essentially gun down newbs or anyone at a lower level than them.
4173	0	a	*DON'T BE FOOLED. THE VIDEOS MAKE IT SEEM AMAZING* When I first saw this, I thought it looked incredible. However, the game doesn't even load! It's really disappointing.
4174	0	a	While this game does stand out in so many ways from others, it is flunked and here's why  The good : Best customization I've seen on any game - Fun gameplay ( even though it is super frustrating at times ) - Decent Graphics for the time - Is free - and is FUN  the bad / ugly: In my 5-6 Years of gaming, Never in my LIFE have I ever seen such terrible matchups. When open conflict district came out, I was surprised when I realized that the matchmaking isn't completly random, Only 3 major threats which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Your 4 man crew which may have total of 100 hours ( all 4 guys combined ) WILL get setup against another 4 man crew of max ranks, each having 2500+ hours each. How is this balanced? Not to mention the prices are thru the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING roof. 80$ for an outfit and a car bodykit. Seriously? I can buy two copies of GTA v for that. The game is SORTA dead. In 2013, Obeya, the most popular server had 5000-7500 Players at peak hours. Now, Obeya has about 1300 peak hours. Colby, the most unpopular server, has about 200 on at peak hours. The game is BRUTAL towards noobs, mostly due to the fact that decent players ( Who are actually silver threat ) get gold SOOO easily and purposely have to dethreat to fight silvers, Leaving no room for the bronzes to learn. There aren't as many hackers anymore thanks to fairfight, but since there are rerolls due to the fact that the game is free, PUNKBUSTER IS NONEXSISTENT and has no banned one single cheater. Cheaters will be banned in 1-5 days from fairfight but then will make new accounts. The game is laggy unless youre on a PC over 1000$+ The worst GM's who ban people who are good against them when theyre streaming. Legits getting banned everywhere. Lack of REAL updates. The last 10 updates have been Armas market stuff ( more stuff that costs 40$ )    Bottom line: APB is such a good game that deserves a try and can be AMAZING with several patches. I would NOT recommend spending a single dollar on this game until the devs get their act together.
4175	0	a	so there i was, a criminal. an old man with gray hair, greased back, wearing a black business suit with black gloves (Iknowyouseemestylin), i just robbed a couple of stores in my big white windowless van, complete with the words 'free candy' sprayed on the sides, when i decided that i wanted to do some missions. so i hit the auto mission button and was thrust into one of those bring item A to area B missions. i get to the door i need to break open to get the item, when suddenly POP, i'm one shot buy a cop with a sniper rifle. i think nothing of it, and go on with my missioning, i start running back when i suddenly hear 'SHHVOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAA BOOOOOOOOOOOOM', i suddenly become tomato sauce and see the death cam, another cop! this one had a rocket launcher. now i'm starting to wonder, how did these 2 guys get such nice things, yet i only have a bloody starter machine gun and pistol. so the match ends (we lost completely), and i go to look for the weapons. none of the merchants I had access to had such nice boomsticks, then i noticed it, APB STORE. so i go onto the arma store and LO AND BEHOLD, Snipers and Rocket Launchers. a can buy PERMANANT guns from the apb store for real world cash. THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS RIGHT FOLKS, guns you buy ingame are 30 day guns, the permanant ones are either horrifically expensive, or cost irl cash (and are also expensive). who has 2 thumbs and won't be playing this game? nathan lane. I too will not play this game.
4176	0	a	i tried to download this and right at the end it error'ed on me lol played Hounds the last hope played it got to mission 5 map would not instal nice to see how games have gone down the drain and say f2p when u p2w
4177	0	a	Hacks and hacks and aimbots and punk buster hacks and more hacking and people who jump while aiming in air and kill you hacks all day everyday if you want to waste money on market place and get hacked with new best gear play APB reloaded and get hacked all day.
4178	0	a	This game was the best ive ever played until they started rolling out the Pay to Wins thats when everything went to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. i means really the matching making was horrible. people blatantly hacking, and the server lags. with the so much money they get on this game they choose not to fix it. i tried to tell them on facebook but they block me from commenting on anything they post. i guess they dont want to hear a fan of the game opinion about their game. i would have recommended this game in a heartbeat but now its just a Pay to Win Simulator
4179	0	a	Nice grafic, nice idea, but horrible balancing (no balancing) and 100% Pay2Win! If u wanna spend all u'r money, play it! if not, let it be...!
4180	0	a	Played it for a while, it was ok and then realized players on your team will hinder you so you dont win (assuming to help level up their friends on the other side). Wasnt even worth the download!
4181	0	a	A horrible example of how overwhelming a pay-to-play game can get. This game is not kind at all for new players and is NOT meant for lower-end computers. The game's worlds are tiny and the missions get repetitive easily.
4182	0	a	repetive and i got hacked so nah
4183	0	a	LAGGIEST GAME EVER!!!!! THEY FIX THIS I'LL BE HAPPY. THEY DON'T WELL I WON'T PLAY THIS GAME EVER AGAIN!
4184	0	a	The plot is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, because there isnt really one, and the servers never â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING WORK!
4185	0	a	pay 2 win, poor match making system, lags alot, bad shooting mechanics, time consuming for weapon/mods/vehicle that lasts days   the only + is the character creation system! the character customization is dope! the ability to create your own music tracks! the ability to create your own logos, the art customization is great! but it aint enough to save it
4186	0	a	So, I played about two hours of this game. And instead of trying to break it down here's my pro/cons  PRO: Character generator is great. The Idea could be really fun.  CONS: The game itself, While it has good concepts, It ends up being glitchy, non-player friendly and the player base, at least for the Eastern NA server is dead.  Micro-Transactions, Like, Too many, there's not enough free-content for the game to hold itself up.  All and all, maybe if i got over the first few hours of play, it might be a passable game, but sadly, i don't see it coming up more than passable.
4187	0	a	This entire game is based off of the classic 'MMO' grinding. This doesn't translate very well into a GTA 'cops 'nd robbers' setting. This game has so many flaws, 80% of my time playing this was just trying to get it open based on multiple launches. It's not worth the download time and the stress. Don't play this. Jesus christ, between the loading times and the god damned lag when driving a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing -CAR-, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE EASILY, MIND YOU, this game is a mess. It needs to be pulled into the backyard and shot OR redone from the ground up, which is something I -KNOW- won't happen. God damned. I'm never going to get this time back from my life.  I give it a ten because I'm a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idiot.
4188	0	a	This game wont even start and i know people would say its my computer but the launcher doesnt even show up it just flashes black then nothing happens
4189	0	a	As of now i cant even spawn i try over and over and i can't spawn and until they fix this i would not recomend unless you would like to sit through 5 minutes of loading screens for the game to crash.
4190	0	a	pay to win trash
4191	0	a	Crashed in the first five seconds. 10/10
4192	0	a	very bad =C
4193	0	a	very laggy, TONS OF INPUT LAGG, and crashes a ton -1/10
4194	0	a	10/10 would never play again. game sucks. small map just a really really crapy version of GTA  
4195	0	a	it allways says app is all ready runing HELP
4196	0	a	I love this game to bits, it's just soo buggy....
4197	0	a	--This game is not F2P, you either pay for premium or don't bother--  APB Reloaded is a game that can be lots of fun but only if you buy a premium account...  I used the premium account trial and I had a great time playing as a criminal but when my trial ran out it immediately had huge effects on my game, most of my stuff became unusable and my best vehicle that I put loads of in-game cash into was turned into a pay wall.  This game has awful matchmaking, I was put into multiple matches against people who were three times my level and all they had to do was shoot me in the foot and I would die instantly.  If I was willing to buy a premium account I would probably like this game but the faulty matchmaking and dodgy reports about the developers will keep me far away from this game.
4198	0	a	lulz this game was good, and only fun to the hackers
4199	0	a	ugly game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it
4200	0	a	the game doesnt even work
4201	0	a	Best example of a pay-to-win I have ever witnessed.
4202	0	a	This game might have been better, I like the idea, I think it has potential, but the studio simply cannot deliver it in a suitable form to players. This might have been better if the weapons were more 'balanced' (in the form of not having shotguns that don't work after 12m), and the 'premium' shop is filled with reskins (of free weapons) and overpriced cosmetics.
4203	0	a	no good if ur new. the gear is too bad so you cant compete with the ppl you have to fight. the game matches you up against experienced players with mad gear -- no XP to be had. uninstalled
4204	0	a	An excellent concept very poorly delivered after it's revival. One sided fire-fights, pay to win weapons, and rediculous matchmaking make this game terrible despite it's potential.
4205	0	a	I never got to try the game because it never would respond when it was in the middle of starting.
4206	0	a	Its beyond boring. no point to it. i tried to play it a billion times and i hated it every time. not worth the free download and space. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game.
4207	0	a	Such potentional in the launch, now they've â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'d it all up. Remember when this game had to be bought retail for 60 bucks? Now it's F2P and guess why.
4208	0	a	Volvo pls buy this game and make it more awesome because 'gamerfirst' just suck â™¥â™¥â™¥. Every week they release a new weapon but upgrading the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing servers ? no.... why should they its not like the servers suck balls. They don't even care about the game those greedy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s.
4209	0	a	The customization is awesome! The match making is terrible. I really really wanted to play this. I LOVE THE CUSTOMIZATION! I just can't take getting brutally murdered on every single mission and people telling me how all silvers need to go kill themselves. Playing vs other bronze players the game is fun. You are both new your weapons kind of suck and it's ok. The second you hit silver you will be massacred again and again and expect both your team mates and the other team (they can whisper you to tell you exactly what kind of an a*#hole you are and how your getting 'rekt!nub silver die!*) to berate you constantly. This makes starting out not only frustrating, but no fun at all. I don't want to be a pretty piece of cannon fodder for P2winners, hackers, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bags. It's kind of funny that the game's anti cheat thinger is called fair fight when nothing past bronze is even sort of fair. Do I want to spend the time watching myself die over and over again so that maybe I can unlock things that will even the score for a game that might (and probably should) die soon? No thanks. Also the hit detection is godawful. If you think shooting someone in the head should count for as many points as shooting them in the foot? You should ignore my review and play apb.
4210	0	a	This is the absolute WORST FPS I've ever played.... you're reading the introductory text (ie., you don't even know the movement keys yet) and get slaughtered in the spawn area by some APB Troll.... then he thinks he's so funny that he does it another 20 times.  If I paid for this game, I'd be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. As it is, I'll simply uninstall it and go back to Combat Arms.
4211	0	a	This game had amazing character customization. purely amazing, the details for styling, and creating your own personal look, is something other games need, BUT, and it is a big but, like on madea. THE GAME SUCKS. the first 30 minutes are pretty entertaining, but after that, it is just a completley horrid experience. shame too. as i said, the customization was nearly perfect. i give it 1/10....no joke 
4212	0	a	10/10 would never play again. game sucks. small map just a really really crapy version of GTA  
4213	0	a	First time funny, second and third time funny, too. But then u see more and more hacker &amp; glitcher.  NO FUN. Don't waste your time with that game!
4214	0	a	Love this game but can't play.. too much lag. not even in 4-5 years since game is running they didnt solve server lag 
4215	0	a	Horrible pay-to-win Saints Row ripoff. Not worth the disk space!
4216	0	a	Great concept for a game. Poor execution.
4217	0	a	i dont understand how to progres in this thing
4218	0	a	Pay to win! **** YOU!!!
4219	0	a	the tutorial isn't really describing how everything works.
4220	0	a	if u are a gangster and you pop a cap a cap in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s â™¥â™¥â™¥ and get drunk on mountin dew then you have completed life
4221	0	a	This game is very very P2W.  and If you don't believe me, go ahead, and you will find out that its very p2w during your first mission, you will have someone with a gun that takes you down with 2 shots, because he/she bought this gun on market place, but you start with probably one of the best free machine guns in game, and you have to put half of the magazine to kill someone, so stupid!
4222	0	a	Game given to us from the heavens includes: The game not working correctly Bugs Runs in background AND MANY MORE Game Of The Year 2015 11/10 Would Uninstall Again!
4223	0	a	The game michanics could be tweeked and the graphics could be better but it seems like a big pay to win.
4224	0	a	?
4225	0	a	This game is so confusing and never got to kill any crooks or cops because of some reason and all of the stuff is pay to get
4226	0	a	The video is nothing like the gameplay witch I hate games like that and I think the basic idead of this game was to copy gta and if thats it F u cause gta is way better than this peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
4227	0	a	If you like pay 2 win, bugs, lag, and s*** gameplay then this is the game for you
4228	0	a	Every time I run it it loads for about a hour, then crashes. Tried it multiple times, to no avail. Get the game, just to see if your system will run it.
4229	0	a	It's like GTA    Except it is not GTA    Just get GTA
4230	0	a	there needs to be more added to the streets because they look so empty and i dont think it would be too hard to add stuff as to fill the streets. i think that they should bring out a update to do with the graphics needing to be re-done.. come on its comeing to 2016 there are alote of games that have better graphics and that are free as well.
4231	0	a	R-U-B-B-I-S-H!!!! i wont make a long review for a bad game, so heres why..: 1st: UNBALANCED GAME, i always found myself getting crushed by high-rank players 2nd: Unfriendly Community 3rd:This is the worst part.......HACKERS!!! Aimbots everywhere!!  So just dont install this game.....just DONT  
4232	0	a	It's fun, but it never got the finish it needed to be a truly great game. At this point, I would say wait for GTA V for PC. It's got similar gameplay, but GTA V is just much better in every conceivable way.
4233	0	a	Point of this game is? Sorry but no!
4234	0	a	Copy of GTA, no very good.
4235	0	a	People with premium weapons usually win this game. noobs get matched against experienced players constantly. Overall, not a very good f2p game
4236	0	a	I tried and tried to play this game but never the less it would never play. I downloaded it, waited 20 minutes for it to update hit the start button and nothing. It just turned off. I tried again another three times. still nothing' I then uninstalled and reinstalled everything and tried another few times and once again NOTHING WORKED!! So im fed up and annoyed and completely deleted it off my computer... This looks like a really fun game but when you just wont work i cant exactly tell you what is good and whats not..  
4237	0	a	This game blows! Don't know where to start. No solid tutorial, just kinda of throws you in the action and has a little pop up telling you to do something, but without telling you how to do said item. Also while you're running around trying to figure out what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your supposed to be doing. Players with far more experience are also in the same area trolling the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of you. Game is definitly Pay-2-Win with the in-game store being packed full of more powerful guns and faster cars. Honestly not worth spending any real money on. Played for a couple of hours and uninstalled it. Best of luck to everyone who keeps playing but you won't be seeing me.
4238	0	a	This is one of those subscription games that had to go free-to-play because they couldn't convince people to keep giving them money, and it shows. The controls are clunky: you have to go through 2-3 menus every time you want to change anything. Anything at all. The vehicles maneuver not quite as well as a fat dog on a trampoline. The player base is one of the worst I've ever seen with regards to team killing 'for lulz' and just congenital inability to cooperate. If you've got your heart set on playing a free shooter with some vehicles, download Planetside 2. Even as flawed as that game is you'll enjoy yourself a whole lot more.
4239	0	a	The customisation is immense, and it was enjoyable buying a new car and pimping it up. Being able to play while listening to my own music and hearing that music muffled blasting out of the car when I left it really made me feel like this was me doing the crime. I found driving around committing small smash and grabs did get a bit tedious but I did have some fun playing with real world mates in this game. The weapon and firing part of the engine is a bit wack and playing with the default guns against people who have rented or paid real money for better guns felt totally pointless.   I did really enjoy playing this game but the higher the level I got the worse the attitude of my team mates became. I counted one night I was booted from 9 out of 10 attempts to play a team mission. I frequently got private message abuse after being kicked.  I have played MMOs and FPSs online for 15 years and these are the worst players I have seen for welcoming people with less skill than them. This is the sole reason I stopped playing.   I would however not recommend it as the game modes and ways to make money are not as immersive as other games out there even though this is FTP.
4240	0	a	The handling and mechanics are clunky, I gave it a try because APB made some noise when it was announced back in the day, now I understand why this version is free. Though there's a lot of interesting initiatives (like a software that lets you compose tunes... in the game), all in all it feels slow and awkward. Don't waste your time on that game.
4241	0	a	I did not even to get to play after character creation for more than 10 seconds before I was perma-banned by some admin.
4242	0	a	i meet minimum requirements and my graphic card isnt good enough   -11/10
4243	0	a	Worst Pay to Win game that is.  You can't do any single mission without having a guy on the enemy team with a yellow sniper rifle that has shiny sparkles with bunny ears that do one shot dead.
4244	0	a	I press start in launcher but the game not show up and my status show online again #WTF
4245	0	a	I am going to change my review now, from the old positive to a horrid negative..  What was I thinking, saying how it's good the game is free to play..  DEVS - (if there are even any) stick a price tag on this game and remove the stupid pay to win benefits, as a new character just on the streets of the multiple towns, I decided to do some missions against the other people in which I would be sharing the city with.  I had my trusty Sniper which I infered did quite a little damage, UNTIL I did this mission.. I decided to take some steps back from the battle and attempt to snipe, I hit multiple times but got destroyed by players equipped in pay to win gear and guns that probably costed more than a CSGO knife, I checked out the store just to see how pay to win it really was..  I would never play this game ever again, I depise this joke of a game. 'APB Reloaded'  They joke you with 'events', the easter event was running round mugging random people and getting eggs, what's fun in that?  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.
4246	0	a	so last year i wrote a review on this game where i rougly said: gameplay is junk, the people who play it are jerks... it's pay 2 win... it's sloppy, the controls responds slowly and the graphics load slower then a snail could win a god damn marathon.  BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION IS GOOD!  thats everything positive... the clothing and tattoos... if they had this kind of custom items in a game like grand theft auto it would be the BIGGEST GAME EVER... but it dosen't, it's the worst damn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i've tried...  do NOT try it! if you have ever tried playing a first person shooter and someone kills you repeadetly thats only the tip of the iceberg, here you will be kicked off servers by punkbuster because someone SAID you were hacking  i was stupid enough to recommend this only for customisation but i regret this now...  NO! do NOT play this...  I CAN'T WARN YOU ENOUGH! DON'T.... DO IT!!!!
4247	0	a	The game wont even start from the launcher 10/10 would never play because it wont even start.
4248	0	a	Great consept. Poor execution. Repetertive, clumsy, dosn't 'capture' the mmo-feeling, not the most interesting world. Milking the cow.
4249	0	a	If you don't spend money you wont have a chance
4250	0	a	APB Was A Fun Game Until Getting Into The Salty Horrifying Community... Just dont get the game.
4251	0	a	(Refer to my profile picture)
4252	0	a	it's quite fun but...   its kinda pay to win~
4253	0	a	I really like the customization,but it's too PayToWin. You can't just spend 100$ on a game.

4257	0	a	APB Reloaded is pretty much deviant art packaged into a .exe. I feel tremendous pain for those who have paid money on this incarnation of this game, which feels like a time capsule as there has still been no meaningful addition to what it offers players even after years of 'development'.  I made a Harlem Globetrotter though so I shall rate this game a 8/10.
4258	0	a	Great Game. One of the game that has held my attention the most. Played it for 2 years...  But, When that is said.. It has also been the most expensive game ever. And its a FreeToPlay!   The game offers a wide varity of guns, advantages, clothing and bodykits for cars = If u got the money.  I would understand if Premium was the only cost ingame. But taking money for 60% of ingame features is just wrong.  The itself is great, but the community is rude and lacks co op, The game is full of hackers, And its a Pay2Win game.   Not just Pay2Win, but Pay2Havefun...   GamerFirst really destroyed a great game.

4274	0	a	I took all the garbage trucks (3 other friends )and drive around the biggest streets just destroying every vehicule I would see. Destroying every minute a person would have...messing with his gaming time...you can't do that anymore as theres no more garbage trucks...
4275	0	a	So hmm, this game is awsome, the features and combat system is amazing the only down about this game is that theres too many hackers. Idk if hacks are easy to get in apb but you can see one hacker in almost every missions u play
4276	0	a	so last year i wrote a review on this game where i rougly said: gameplay is junk, the people who play it are jerks... it's pay 2 win... it's sloppy, the controls responds slowly and the graphics load slower then a snail could win a god damn marathon.  BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION IS GOOD!  thats everything positive... the clothing and tattoos... if they had this kind of custom items in a game like grand theft auto it would be the BIGGEST GAME EVER... but it dosen't, it's the worst damn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i've tried...  do NOT try it! if you have ever tried playing a first person shooter and someone kills you repeadetly thats only the tip of the iceberg, here you will be kicked off servers by punkbuster because someone SAID you were hacking  i was stupid enough to recommend this only for customisation but i regret this now...  NO! do NOT play this...  I CAN'T WARN YOU ENOUGH! DON'T.... DO IT!!!!
4277	0	a	This game is an MMO. If that doesn't tell you what you should expect, probably stay away. If you like dying over and over again, this might be the game for you. I don't, which is why I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Frankly, this is not a review of the game so much as it is of the genre and the community. If you're the kind of person who can keep interest in this sort of thing long enough to get good, my review should mean nothing to you.  As for the rest? The people like me who joined too late/couldn't get the hang of it, and were thus deprived of all the fun this game had to offer? Well, if you're like me, you got interested in this based on style, color, and rampant, light-hearted brutality. You can find all that, plus a single-player or co-op environment that wants you to experience it, in the Saint's Row series. Saint's Row the Third and Saint's Row IV in particular are the closest to what I wanted out of APB. And go ahead and get the full package for the games as well, if you can. Having a tank right out of the tutorial sequence was EXTREMELY helpful and fun in 3.
4278	0	a	Calling this a GTA clone is an insult to GTA. Calling it crap is a slap in the face of feces. This is just a terrible, terrible game with ps2 era graphics and gameplay.
4279	0	a	A F2P game that follows a stereotypical, terribly designed microtransaction model that immediately puts you up against a pay wall. What is worse is the horrible driving and shooting mechanics.
4280	0	a	What a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dont play this game, the character creator is the only good thing about this game.
4281	0	a	It's GTA + aimbots
4282	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4283	0	a	Some good things about the game :  - Best character creator I've ever seen  - Nice take on cops and robbers  - Great ways to customize clothing and vehicles  - You can create your own music  - Wide range of weapons and clothes  - Gameplay is fun for a while  - 2 reasonably big maps to play on  - Great leveling system  *Instead of actual levels, you level up contracts, that will reward you with new vehicles, clothing, weapons, customization options, and new contacts to level up.    Some bad things about the game :  -The game has a P2W (Pay-to-Win) feel to it  *Great weapons cost real money and are very overpowered compared to the in-game weapons  - F2P weapons are very similar  *Several of the same weapon, with different buffs  - FPS isn't very smooth unless you have a good PC  - Driving is a bit slow, reactions are off  *Turning has a very slight delay after pressing the key  - Absolutely terrible ranking system  *The game's 'Threat Level' is basically a ranking to show off your skill in matches.  *The game has districts dedicated for each rank (Gold, silver bronze) but players of that rank aren't forced to join one of those servers, resulting in a high amount of golds in silver districts (Very little, if any, silvers), and many golds/silvers in bronze districts (Few bronzes). This makes it hard for bronzes and silvers to level up.   The game is fun overall but being P2W ruins it for me. I don't know if many others have had a similar issue, but whenever the game is installed to my pc, it slows down my performance overall, but goes away once uninstalled. The game's worth trying out, but don't expect for it to be the greatest thing ever.
4284	0	a	Accumlated 3.5k hours on this game. It's garbage, dont do it.
4285	0	a	This game (to me) is horrible, I can't even load into the game as it f'ing sends me to a page to like their facebook page 
4286	0	a	Quite an interesting concept, but not my kind of game. Also, I found the graphics &amp; mechanics fairly crude. Mostly tho, as a newcomer, I found it confusing, frustrating &amp; not rewarding, but that could just be my ineptitude at this game. I came to this from Defiance, having heard that this was the better game from that 'stable'. I found Defiance much easier to understand &amp; enjoyed many hours playing it.
4287	0	a	the tutorial isn't really describing how everything works.

4289	0	a	Alot of hackers , couldn't play or do a thing -.-
4290	0	a	Its a free to play game, it's the same as all the others.
4291	0	a	I don't recomend this to any new players because everyone else would be OP to you.
4292	0	a	This game is very very P2W.  and If you don't believe me, go ahead, and you will find out that its very p2w during your first mission, you will have someone with a gun that takes you down with 2 shots, because he/she bought this gun on market place, but you start with probably one of the best free machine guns in game, and you have to put half of the magazine to kill someone, so stupid!
4293	0	a	I loved playing the game for the first few days until I discovered something by dumb curiosity. When the best equipment that is FAR FAR FAR superior to anything you can grind for exists as well as content that is almost needed to have purchased to keep playing at a sensible level, well....I can only recommend this is you enjoy spending a lot of money on a game. Besides that complaint, I can only say that development after beta was dissapointing, but the game is very very fun. I cannot argue with the idea that if the real money guns were available for a stupid amount of ingame currency, I would not be on any other game. But...pay to win. Best of luck out there!
4294	0	a	--This game is not F2P, you either pay for premium or don't bother--  APB Reloaded is a game that can be lots of fun but only if you buy a premium account...  I used the premium account trial and I had a great time playing as a criminal but when my trial ran out it immediately had huge effects on my game, most of my stuff became unusable and my best vehicle that I put loads of in-game cash into was turned into a pay wall.  This game has awful matchmaking, I was put into multiple matches against people who were three times my level and all they had to do was shoot me in the foot and I would die instantly.  If I was willing to buy a premium account I would probably like this game but the faulty matchmaking and dodgy reports about the developers will keep me far away from this game.
4295	0	a	This game might have been better, I like the idea, I think it has potential, but the studio simply cannot deliver it in a suitable form to players. This might have been better if the weapons were more 'balanced' (in the form of not having shotguns that don't work after 12m), and the 'premium' shop is filled with reskins (of free weapons) and overpriced cosmetics.
4296	0	a	I wouldn't pay attention to the trailers. Very misleading. I trusted them and expected something like Grand Theft Auto, so of course I was interested. What I got was a cash-grabby clone with sloppy controls and cringe-worthy player base.  The game takes every moment as an opportunity to squeeze a couple bucks out of you. Seriously, 100 dollars for an expansion pack? That's ridiculous.  The controls are pretty bad- They are very unresponsive and sloppy, definately not what the trailer advertised.  Bad game, just shell out the money for Grand Theft Auto V. It's much better and probably cheaper in the long run.
4297	0	a	if you like tutorials that take 3 hours you will love this game
4298	0	a	This game is nearly dead... Only a few hardcore players left plus the server latency makes this game impossible to play (completely ignoring the p2w aspect).
4299	0	a	Dislike It is so laggy its not my laptop not myversion of windows its the game it self
4300	0	a	I dont know what to say... Its not a good game
4301	0	a	My main game to play, loved the customization, but have to say that it is pay to win, also lot of hackers / cheaters , and nobody cares.. so i canÂ´t reccomend this game sorry
4302	0	a	The only problem i had, was the biggest one. MY SCREEN WOULD NOT STOP SPINNING. Everytime i tried to move my screen spun. everytime i got in game, my screen spun.
4303	0	a	Toggled ready button cause didn't want to pvp. Goes robbing and ramming store windows. 3 gold players driving by (On a bronze server mind you). They spotted me and get forced into pvp, regardless of ready button toggled. Cue the ragefest 
4304	0	a	When i looked at screenshoots i really thought that this game is amazing. But unfortunatelly i discovered it is not so good as it looks. Stupid quests, useless customization... It is just not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fun to play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It sucks for real. So i really NOT RECOMMEND to play this game, because its nothing but wasting of your time.
4305	0	a	You have to pay for things and you do anything
4306	0	a	Only way I can really think to describe this is an unfun version of saints row 3
4307	0	a	hard to set up i uninstallled this game
4308	0	a	Was good, and fun. I was pretty high rank, at about 195. But somehow my account got banned for no reason. Contacted both Gamer's First and Punkbuster support. No help given. Lost about $200-$300 worth of lifetime equipment.
4309	0	a	The game on Steam is not the current copy of the game, so you have to spend extra time updating it inside of an application that launches the game itself. Then theres 6 splash screens, which aren't skippable. The game window does not fullscreen or even window properly, and does not lock the cusor.   The game then demands you to make an account on the publisher's website, and refuses to use a standard Steam login without linking it.   There are hackers absolutely everywhere you look, and they arent the subtle 'twitch to the head for a headshot' or a slight speedhack, im talking about them flying and jumping all over the place 1 shotting everything. What makes matters worse is that the premium players have weapons that mimic the hacker's weapons insanely well, so its often times impossible to spot an actual hacker until the blast off into the sky.  Naturally with all 'free to play' games, you can buy premium currancy that is often times required to actually progress further without spending day and days of your time just to get a slightly better machine pistol.  The only good side to this game is the car customization. Its a bit wonky, but it has more customization options than any other game that I've seen.   All and all: Disappointing buggy mess that the devs do not seem to care much about past making money from users.
4310	0	a	fun and unique game, but it became pay to win you will download it, try it and delete it eventually...

4319	0	a	This game has the potential to be good and it try's really hard but its a completely pay to win
4320	0	a	there needs to be more added to the streets because they look so empty and i dont think it would be too hard to add stuff as to fill the streets. i think that they should bring out a update to do with the graphics needing to be re-done.. come on its comeing to 2016 there are alote of games that have better graphics and that are free as well.
4321	0	a	This game is a peice of sh*t! Do not install this game UNLESS you want to fork over a good $1000 to the companies whop made this game. This is just amazing how I thought it was a good game, then all of the sudden I start playing it. For the first 10 minutes, it's OK. But then high ranking players sniper me from a lightyear away. It's redicious. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!
4322	0	a	May have been worth downloading when it first came out, but now the only people playing it are kids who stole their parents money to buy a 50$ car and a 200$ full-auto pistol.    But if you have the money to do the same, it can be really fun, driving, missions, Shooting, are all great but if you dont pay over 100$ for a really good gun then you're not going to be able to get the in-game money to buy anything fun.
4323	0	a	This game is deader than the zombie apocalypse, the nuclear fallout, or whatever disaster that decreases human population density up to 50 square miles per person per server region.   If you played the game right now, you will get to be a part of a special few that have spent too much money to let the game go. Also some people just can't play the game without 'trainers'.  You want to play with the same person every night? That have been playing years before you? Has tricks that you don't have? I guess this game is for you.   As a person that has been a commune to the game before, my warning of this game being a 'Gold' drainer has not been heeded 5 years ago. Buy permanent to win or pay premium to be financially stable to even participate in the whole item customization and selling experience.  Yes you will have to rent guns that expire weekly if you have not bought any. Expire weekly.  If not bought. Up to 20k gold for a gun. When a maximum amount possible weekly earned is a little 5k. Not counting the the little Cops and Robbers sideshow that earns more money than the actual missions, nobody does that anymore.   The new guns that came out on the market is to say 'Sorry but we are too lazy to fix the weapon balance, here buy these new ones instead'. Those guns are not 'rentable'. 
4324	0	a	First i would like to say this is one of the best games out there despite the Pay for more mindset of this game. costumization is crazy deep detailed but the default substcription you carry as a new player limits you to 25% of this games costumization capabilities. that aside there is also very anoying mechanics in this game specially playing as a bandit or criminal. a enforcer can handcaff you from miles away limiting your abillity to fight back or even try to brake restrains. little things like this are game braking. i havent spent much time in this game to give you a detailed idea of everything in this game. another thing that really bothers me is the community simply because its mostly filled with a very young community fan base. it bothers me i have to go online and play with 10 year olds. this game has the potencial to be the best game on steam for GTA fans and i think if taken in the right direction it would surpass GTA in many ways. i recommend it for a casual gamer not someone thats looking to take the most out of this game becouse that? .... well thats just impossible unless you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gold bars.......
4325	0	a	Game is hilariously broken. It's fun to play for a few hours while you marvel at the bugs. The 'physics' are absurd and worse than anything I've ever seen in a commercial game with this many players. You can tell they have the basic weighting or friction completely wrong within the few seconds and the masses of most objects are hilarious. Boxes work like baloons, etc.  Also funny is that civilians inside of cars you steal don't actually exist. So once you rip them out of the car they simply stand there and then disappear. You can cancel some actions in odd ways as well. This means you can begin stealing a car, stop stealing it - doing so causes the civilian driving it to disappear.  I find myself not playing the game much because it's more entertaining to see how they messed up things.  Oh look at the ground when you get a chance you'll notice it has lots of weird glitches. They didn't get the shaders for the ground right...
4326	0	a	This game was so bad, it made me write my first review and I've seen some pretty bad games in the years I was on steam  This game got some pretty nice customisation options and decent graphics, but that's about it. Get repetitive about 1 hour in. Worst...controls...ever. Not for solo player. Weapons can only be used for 10 days before breaking down(except the starting ones). Cars drive like a whale on a skateboard. Such a waste of potential...  Go play Defiance instead if you want a third person shooter mmo, better in everything save personalisation.  Ce jeu est tellement merdique que j'ai du Ã©crire une Ã©valuation pour la premiÃ¨re fois, et Dieu sait que j'ai vu de la â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pendant toutes ces annÃ©es avec steam.  Ce jeu a de merveilleuses options de personalisation et de bon graphiques, mais c'est a peu prÃ¨s tout. RÃ©pÃ©titif aprÃ¨s une heure. Pires...controles...jamais...vus. Pas pour les joueurs solos. Les armes ne peuvent Ãªtre utilisÃ©es que pendant 10 jours avant de disparaÃ®tre(sauf celles du dÃ©but. Un beau gachis de potentiel.  Allez jouer Ã  Defiance Ã  la place si vous voulez un mmo de tir a la 3e personne, meilleur en tout sauf la personalisation(qui n'est pas pour autant mauvaise).
4327	0	a	I don't like writing bad reveiws. I am saying a no on my recommendation,(The little hand thingy),but I am saying yes at the same time. It is a very good idea of a game. It was developed well,the idea is good,and they came through with the idea. But the bad part is that it is a PAY TO WIN. I mean,come on. You have more gun verieties than GTA(From what I've seen,but you can buy them with real money,or rent them. Really I would only spend money on this game if I just had EXTRA money on my account that I have no other use for. To recap,the game itself was good,but any customisation that you actually want to look good (That's not basic) you have to invest money into. I would highly recomend this game if they change their Pay To Win ways.
4328	0	a	Dont waste your time on this stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...
4329	0	a	I bought this game on original release.... why should i pay to play?
4330	0	a	The one thing I can say about this game, is that if youve played GTA at all online, you wont want to play this game. there are way too many fetures in this game that just do not work at all. That being said, even as a stand alone with no history of ever playing GTA this game sucks.
4331	0	a	Not a good game. Much cheater, nobody to punish them. Glitch and cheat it's all you have to rememeber, people use auto aim and others glitch with game mecanical ( sit on the roof of a car to cancel a a debuff of speed)  COmmunity is very worst , people insult and just hit your car to make annoy you (its bring nothing just loosing you time)  THere is a mtchmaker in game but unfortunally it's the worst i never saw, you fight againt high level and high skilled people so you can't do nothing and you can't progress becasue oyu die every time.
4332	0	a	i played this game about a few months ago, and lets just say it was awful  1, the game looked awful  2, the most people you are going to see are very high levels that will pretty much kill you in one shot  3, you are most likely going to not even make it past the first mission  this game was a horrible experince to me and i personnaly never want to go back, the game was probably good 4 years ago but now its just a waste of time
4333	0	a	wish it would open

4345	0	a	This game have a lot of cheaters now and is P2W. I'd rather to uninstall this for now untill they don't remove this options. But this is unbelievable. I had nice times with my friends and that's all. If you want to play just do it!
4346	0	a	R-U-B-B-I-S-H!!!! i wont make a long review for a bad game, so heres why..: 1st: UNBALANCED GAME, i always found myself getting crushed by high-rank players 2nd: Unfriendly Community 3rd:This is the worst part.......HACKERS!!! Aimbots everywhere!!  So just dont install this game.....just DONT  
4347	0	a	This game used to be great, but now it feels like it's falling apart. Just today, I was d/c twice while I was on the winning team. I don't d/c when I'm losing tho &gt;_&lt; The hitbox is simple, and lots of people whine at me just cause I play sniper. I hope the servers stop crashing.  If you want to be successful, gotta spend money to earn money. I don't spend real money, but I do throw in ingame money on timed weapons cause it's worth it. I love the customization in game. The matchmaking isn't so great in that sometimes you get new players against a team with rockets and fast cars
4348	0	a	Might have been good when it first came out, but nobody plays it anymore so there are verry few servers. Also the controlls are terrible, it's extremely difficult just to drive down the street. Basically just convice yourself to drop $8 on gta sanandreas and you have a better game.
4349	0	a	It not good because if you like starting out you and when you in a fight the team is overpower if you want to get better it like $50 to buy to get what you want the other game Fallen earth is a lot better than this game and you buit and pvp as long as you want
4350	0	a	This is both the best and worst game I have played.   But the disadvantages definitely outweigh the advantages.   First off, you join APB and it seems pretty damn cool - the customization is extremely enticing, and is probably the best thing about the whole damn game. But then after you first create your character and have gone through basic game mechanics in the tutorial, you have to begin doing 'missions' which are a total and utter waste of time since the hierarchy system is as much use as a chocolate fireguard. You work through some crappy 'Threat level' system ... Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold - sounds like it is fairly simple but it's not. As soon as you move from newbie Green, and into Bronze you suffer from the worst insults ever from the community just based on the bloody colour of the logo next to your name - not even on your play ability!. For anyone new, this gets bloody annoying and will surely steer people away from the game.  I have been playing this for a year now, and have been Silver only a handful of times - only to move back into Bronze. I wouldn't mind, if the matchmaking system actually worked. Now tell me GamersFirst - how is it so that 4 bronze competitors can match in skill and experience against 1 Gold and 3 Silvers for example, that have Rocket and Grenade Launchers... how are these advanced players even able to pick that they want to be in a Bronze server? Of course when there is the 'easier' option, people will take it. Therefore why not remove that opportunity and keep Golds in Gold servers and Silvers in Silver servers. This is how the game was meant to be - so why not fix it? I understand people will say 'Oh there's no excuse to new people and bronzes, teamwork and skill can overcome any opponent - ' No, you're having a laugh. More experienced players have more advanced mods and weapons (and sometimes even hacks, but that's only on occasion now) not to mention experience, so of course the newer players and lower down players have no chance at all.   Another thing to point out, is that most of the community has gone to shreds. Today, I was called 'noob' followed by other eye-rolling names by a Silver on a Bronze server for killing them. Hmm hang on there? Killing them - that's the point of the game isn't it? And if anyone wishes to call me a 'noob' so be it but - really, they're a bit of a hypocrite if they're more advanced and have to stick to the server for Bronzes and newcomers. Furthermore, people often get annoyed with newbies Team Killing them - yes so do I, but if you communicate with them and tell them that you're on their team, and help them learn instead of just expecting them to be advanced and instantly know what the hell they're doing - the APB community will become a better place, and will save any frustration.  So here's the good stuff listed:  1 Extremely addictive 2 Customization 3 Variety of weapons/mods to unlock (without having to pay with REAL MONEY on Armas Marketplace) 4 (Team Work) - [In brackets because it's not always there] 5 Rewarding missions and Fight Club is great 6 Numerous different contacts to level up 7 Season events (Halloween, Christmas etc.)  And a summary of the bad stuff:  1 Newcomers will probably find it overwhelming 2 Bronze servers littered with higher threat levels 3 Needs a new matchmaking system 4 Community needs to be more helpful and more willing to accept new players 5 More communication between players 6 Server lags often occur, especially during Fight Club due to amount of players 7 Frustration when people are 'Away From Keyboard' during a mission - why not just kick them? 8 Occasional hackers 9 Just rude players genuinely ruining a game with so much potential  Ultimately, I'd say if you haven't, give this game a try. But in all honestly, it's just not worth the brain melting frustration.
4351	0	a	this game isnt that good i mean i went on to the enforcer side and people were talking about being horny and being nude in skype calls
4352	0	a	dont waste your time here.
4353	0	a	Its a pay to win game!!  Was fun at first before they got greedy and now only cheaters and people with credit cards play. AVOID THIS GAME!!
4354	0	a	Don't touch this game unless you have friends (AND U GUYS PRBLY DONT LOL). It's completely and utterly garbage without it. No but seriously, this game is an utter mess, it's good fun with your friends but otherwise you deal with a toxic community, a questionable company and so many hackers that the braindead community can't distinguish between the real ones and players that just play a lot.
4355	0	a	After 250 hours of grinding and acheiving gold rank the without shelling out $250 for a weapon, I was blown away (literaly) with the sheer pay to win game this has become. The players with the magic ability of excess money have access to the most overpowered and broken guns, abilities, vehicles, and gear imaginable. Trying to play this game as a free to play player is a death sentance. You will be massacred by premium weapons and peak level players who have unlocked every weapon and are free to unleash it on lower level characters who just finished the tutorial. It's very ironic, playing a cops and robbers game that espouses the concepts of justice and freedom, only to have financle shackles placed firmly on the wallets of the players.
4356	0	a	The game seemed pretty decent right off the bat. Then I played a little longer and realized, it is a rushed piece of crap that should have never been released. It has potential however thats like saying Michael Jordan had potential at baseball BS he sucked at baseball. The game could have been something much better. All I am saying is that if it hadn't been rushed and it had a little bit more put into it, is that it would be a great GTA alternative or at least that's what I think             Sincerely, AnTixRushed
4357	0	a	Avoid this game like the plague. The shooting mechanics are horrible, and the objective fighting is bland. For something that shouts out MMO GTA it just feels empty as hell, with the largest battle I had being two versus two. SHIITTTTT
4358	0	a	The game play component has two modes, join a mission district and press k to get shot at, or join an action district and have the game press k for you, so you can get shot at sooner, as well as having more people to shoot at you. As for the ranking system, with the aid of mommys credit card it can join the plot over in the corner, ever so often clear its throat and stretching a little , and mumbling something along the lines of 'this game isnt pay to win, you can unlock all the weapons as you progress through the game' to which you will reply 'what about the weapons i cant unlock through the game' right before resumes its silent vigil. All points bullitin caters to a unique few, the extremely rich, the extremely close, and the devs, the cash shop redundifies any and all attempts at proggression, while also placing some out of reach weaponery into the game, as for the joker store...suffice to say its a joke (see what i did there). All Lag Bullitin has optomization issues, that would give the dialup era of online gaming a run for its money when it comes to unreliability, the server is secretly the worlds most advanced rng as it has awareness, but many years of neglect have lead it to become resentful of humanity and thus you will find in your moment of need, when you are soo close to murdering Xx_rApEdyeMUMm8_xX and restoring honor to you family the server will get distracted and forget to register... well anything, and after a quick game of he said she said you are shuffled along to the respawn screen, the game is horribly unreliable unless you the lucky few, then you have nothing to worry about youll be sything down noobs and veterans alike blessed by the almighty apb god we call server, with the lag armor. Having said all this there are some good points to apb such as the customization.... yup thats the only redeeming quality, if this were a fashion world simulator it would be enough, but in a badly optimized tps (third person shooter) it just means you'll look pretty while your ragdoll lays on the floor, and theres not much else to redeem the game.  in conclusion the devs are bad, the game mechanics are bad, the servers are bad, the community is   toxic garbage, left behind by the civilized word, gained sentience and decided to stage a perverse mockery of a community   bad, the funeral clothes creater is indepth and well designed.    TL;DR the games bad, unless you spend your time in bronze, then you can enjoy countless hours of blissful ignorance, while you skip along to the sound of angry 12 yearolds
4359	0	a	Bunch of greedy developers with no support for it's community.
4360	0	a	Not great in my personal opinion. Hard to drive and when I went on I couldn't find anyone else. It's free, but there isn't any other reason than that why I would play this. And consequently, I dont.
4361	0	a	boring game , cheap gta rip off
4362	0	a	Cool Graphics but it's bad game and very laggy !
4363	0	a	Just as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as the first time this game came out.
4364	0	a	Laggy, kicks you off of your server up to 15 times an hour, waste of space unless you have a VERY fast computer.
4365	0	a	The game is OKAY at best. The maps are OKAY in size. The combat is OKAY. The driving is not good. The game is confusing and the overall game feels clunky and un-finished. If you're too cheap for GTA (like myself) and end up downloading this game with high hopes, your best bet is not to waste your time on this one. 
4366	0	a	I have not yet got to play this game , However it states that i have played for 89 mins. untrue I can not even get into it and i have loged in iI have created and regiestered but have yet to play the damed game what the hell is it. I am taking every thing out of my laptop now and forgetting I even tried this god awlful game bye bye
4367	0	a	WAAAAY back in the day I was picked to alpha test this game. The entire community of testers told the Devs time and again that they needed to add things to APB other than pure PvP for the game to work. Unfortunately, they never listened to their potential customers, the game did terribly, and the original devs ended up closing shop because of it! Now that it's been out for a while on the F2P market I figured I would give it a try, to see if the game has matured into something other than what it used to be. Sadly, nothing has been changed. The same glitches are in the game, and even with a &lt;60 ping latency the server still bugs out when there's a lot of people in one place.   If all you're interested in is running and gunning against other players then have at it, otherwise I would recommend other games like The Secret World that are on the F2P market.
4368	0	a	Credit card = MVP EVRRY TIME!!!!
4369	0	a	i was sooooooo excited to get this game! and i tried everything to make it work but it wont even come on! 
4370	0	a	Fun Game, AWSOME Customization, sadly Pay2Win, and the community is terrible. If you buy items on the shop, for example, the clothing, if you create a new chatacter or the character you bought them on is lost then you would need to buy them again for another character, that goes for weapons and vehicles and everything else on the shop. Your wallet may need therepy, lots of therepy after trying to have fun with this game which means paying $20-$60 for one gun just for the community to call you a Pay2Win Noob. Even then to truely have fun you would need to pay for premium which costs $50 and thats only for half a year, then you gotta pay for clothing, weapons, and vehicles which compared to the F2P players is extremly unbalenced. Great game tho, but Toxic Community and the Company is powered by Greed. I mean, try it if you want, im not gonan stop you. It is 'free' after all. :3
4371	0	a	As someone who has played APB a long time back when it wasnt on steam aswell, I have to say this, The game is good yes but what ruined this game atleast for me and proably for many others.. Is the fact that the community is the way it is... They are salty.. Mad at that theres cheater and that it's basicly P2W Most of the players you will meet are only in there to show others how horrible this game has become by being rude and sorry my language being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s aswell   Now if you can somehow avoid the community I can tell you will have your fun in this with friends and such   I am honestly suprised it is still alive seeing how GTA online is now on pc and has much more stuff to do :p well on that note   My regards.

4375	0	a	Well what can i tell you that has not already been said, this game was fair and loaded with hackers but still playable in the beginning and as time passed it went down hill. I am a senior player with max level characters and you can take this review for what it is, my experiences over time  few examples 1. Devs/GMs have there fav players make them testers, as representatives of the game they get free weapons the problem is they have the poorest attitude and only promote a bad gaming experience, and trying to report them is like trying to put a 3 inch nail in concrete with a playschool hammer, the GMs and Devs are useless cardboard cutouts, lol and they like to ban people for speaking there mind and challenging them when they are being one sided to there friends. This is what you get when you let untrained people run a company and a game with sooooooo much potential  2. still a horrible balance system, bugs and lag out the butt even after this long and one sided spawning, placing one player at 50m from item and the other 400m  3. Lol the world saving new anti cheat system and the root of most of the new problems FAIRFIGHT. Don't get me wrong I love this anti cheat as it fished out all of the players you already knew were hacking and was good for some lols when you read the forums from the top rankers who were banned, but it gave G1 some thing new to focus on how to make there game a pay to play again. The solution? Tweaked armas guns. Yes most of these guns are just reskins of stock weapons but...... the stats are tweaked just enough so that with the right mods you will out perform any free to play weapon, crack your wallets open now  4. lol 'the children have come out to play'. To many wet behind the ears, window licking kids on here now. They got mommy's credit card and and a whinny mouth that won't close, they are usually the first ones to cry hacker at a loss or cry noob to other players at a win you will never here a gg from them, and its only going to get worse when the console kids get on....THIS I HOPE WILL BE THE FINAL NAIL IN THIS GAMES SAD DOWNFALL COFFIN  Most senior players and clans have long abandoned this game you see them from time to time usually in the chat room visiting but most of the GG players are gone, they have a good nose they can smell when something is dead  I'm not saying don't try it but just be warned this is what you get to look forward to
4376	0	a	In this game you will only meet kids who spend their money for stupid things...  This game is full of guys with OP guns...You cant do nothing to them...You must atleast empty up to 3-4 magazines to kill them while they kill you in 2-3 hits...  Game was great at the beginning but later it really becomes unplayable.. The only good thing is Character/Symbol Creator and nothing else... I dont recommend this game cuz it sucks...  0/10 Not worth installing...
4377	0	a	Borind. And ugly. Not because of the game it self, but mostly cause of the players. Do not download.

4382	0	a	This game used to be one of my favorite games of all time. I've spent hundreds of hours playing, but lately the developers seem to be milking the players for all they're worth. They release new 'legendary' guns almost monthly, which can only be won with a 1% chance by opening Joker Mystery Boxes (They cost $1 a pop).   Also, their balance team doesn't seem to know how to properly balance the in-game weapons. At the time of writing, they are trying to balance them by introducing some wonky recoil mechanics on all of their guns it seems. The servers are absolute trash and you'll notice, even with the new servers, constant stuttering or warping, and mind you I play on a rather great PC.  The community has absolutely no regulation. There are no GMs patrolling the districts so you can expect a lot of foul language, hate speech, harassment and angry whisper messages from other players. With the exception of new guns or cars (AKA Cash Grabs), there has been no new content added to the game since the game's inception in 2008. There are only two playable districts and a couple of fight clubs and that is all you'll ever see in this game are these maps.  I can not recommend this game in good faith. Hopefully things change drastically, but I doubt that will happen with the way the current developers and team are handling this game.

4384	0	a	Get killed by your own teammates    5/10
4385	0	a	the game is really fun but its ruined by how badly they want you to spend real money on the game. in order to get anything decent or cool you need to pay money for god damn points. you can only have 2 decals on your car if u want more u need to pay. character stuff u need to pay. f that. basically this game should be called money waster simulator. if they get rid of the money and make a way to get those stuff then 8/10.
4386	0	a	Bad staff, and a game that's 70% problems
4387	0	a	Worst game ever unless you got a big wallet! DONT PLAY IT!
4388	0	a	i hate this game
4389	0	a	Hackerfest and the absolute definition of pay to win...steer clear of this game the best you can. The company is absolutely horrible and cares nothing about their customers. They rip people off on a usual basis and are pro-cheater as they consider cheaters paying customers. Additionally, the servers are very shoddy and lag on a fairly consistent basis.
4390	0	a	Totally waste of time... Free to Play games should be banned from Steam....grinding and money draining as we are going to work to be ripped off whilst spending some time with our hobby! If you want do do a favour to yourself leave F2P games to old people on Mobile Phones!
4391	0	a	Only thing I LOVE about this game is the custome tatoos, shirts, and cars, however, in order to gain full access to customization tools, you need to pay real money to unlock more layers...wtf! That is just a bumer for me, still manage to get some nice logos done. After the customization side of this game, it's pretty bad. It's pretty much GTA Online for F2P. It's call F2P, but those who spent real cash has a giant advantage over those who don't. Good weapons are all really high rank and requires a lot of grinding to get. This game is not beginner friendly at all.
4392	0	a	APB Reloaded is, in my experience, a good and fun concept gone wrong. Server lag hits often, meaning that only people who pay for top-notch internet can keep going without any interruptions. The matchmaking system is undeniably the worst I have ever seen. 10 minutes in and I get thrown into a match with people who have nothing but machine guns that can blow up my car in less time than I can react, and even if I'm outside of a car, that thing can still rip me a new one while I still have my stock assault rifle. I've heard about cheaters and hackers, but I don't recall ever encountering one, though it's hard to tell when many weapons are essentially 2-4 shot kills. The weapons are good and do their job right. The assault rifles are neither good nor bad at anything in particular, the shotguns are guarunteed kills at close range, snipers are excellent at long range. But the machine guns, those things are over powered. As stated before, the machine guns can destroy vehicles in about 2 or 3 seconds of sustained fire. Most people cruise around in their stock cop/criminal cars which can't withstand too much fire and end up dead. They also have insane range and accuracy. The only weakness I've heard about them is that they suffer an absolutely terrible drop in accuracy when moving, but it doesn't seem to be as bad as it claims since I've been bum rushed by several people who just spray-n-pray. The only thing good about the game is the game modes and progression system, but with the problems I mentioned before one would have to take this with a mountain of salt. Like I said at the begginning of my review, it's a good concept that suffers from bad design and maintenance.
4393	0	a	Truely awful. You will just die, and die, and die by simply overpowered players that have put their money into the grind machine to quickly unlock the best possible weapons that will one shot you before you can blink. No tutorial that I noticed, and no match making, just thrown into a mess. Appalling game.
4394	0	a	I want to like this game. It has the potential to be fun. It's mechanics are great. The idea behind it amazing. But alas, it lacks the one thing any PVP game requires: Balance. It advertises a tutorial server that doesn't exist, so you're tossed into the thick of things to learn the game. It doesn't tell you controls, mission types, or anything of the sort, and the worst of it all is the utter lack of balance. A fresh off the boat character will be matched against gold level players wielding rocket launchers and LMG's that may as well be classified as ranged chainsaws. It's not newbie friendly at all, and it doesn't give you a chance to learn the game before putting you against people who live and breath the game. I can't recommend this, as much as I want to enjoy it.
4395	0	a	Do not get this game, unfair, pay to win and no fun to play at all :/
4396	0	a	every time it launches the game keeps on saying reinstall so when i reinstalled it still didnt work
4397	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the game is fake you w8 3 houreews to download and then you can even launch the game...
4398	0	a	Game is horrible, feels cheap and generic especially in the physics realm. Don't download this garbage.
4399	0	a	This game requires that you downgrade your graphics drivers pretty heavily for the game to even launch at all. Sorry APB, but I'm not going back to 2011's geForce drivers just for you.
4400	0	a	THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE DO NOT PLAY
4401	0	a	all the horrible things are true..... so true..... PLUS if you play as bandit you just randomly surrender.  this game will lower your opinion of the human race no matter how bad it already was
4402	0	a	so bad  hard controls  not fun
4403	0	a	I'm playing on a 2500 dollar game rig that was built within the last 6 months. With my setup this game plays for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I can barely get 20 fps during combat. Customisation is amasing, though. I hear it's p2w, but I can't confirm as I can't really play it.
4404	0	a	Why wont the game load for me?
4405	0	a	Game controls are Saints Row II awkward, and community is full of bitter people. Not trolls trying to be funny, just bitter people.
4406	0	a	WOW, You name the hack, here it is.. shocking amount of cheating, And high lvl VIP coming into servers just to blow you away Most likley because they are bored!! I gave it every chance and tried to ignore the warning`s posted by other`s and give this a go..OMFG!! be warned DO NOT DO THE SAME.. I promise you, I deplore you not to download this game.. Unless you have every intent on hacking like most in this game.. then join with your hacking brothers!! Such a shame has great potential, But clearly made to make a few quid and close this one down like they did the first!! Cant give this a lower thumbs down if i tried 100% thumbs down!!
4407	0	a	I would not recommend this game. If you're not willing to cough up the money, then the game isn't that fun. As either a Criminal or an Enforcer, you get mauled by others before you even get a chance to try to learn how to play. If you're new, then no one wants you. For me, probably because of my location from the server, it lags. This has a big impact. If it lags even a tiny bit, and makes it so you can't aim straight, or drive the car correctly, let's just say, 'It's not fun.' So, unless you don't have any lag at all, you can pick up how to play in the first few minutes, and you're willing to cough up the cash or barely get anywhere, then all the luck to you.

4419	0	a	I will say this game has the best customization in a game I have ever seen! but as for gameplay goes, driving in this game is horrible it's like every car is on ice being a free game as well has invited a lot of hackers to play and the game is just dead now.  Don't waste your time.
4420	0	a	I've put a few weeks into this game.  The missions are good and varied. The customization is pretty decent as well. Though, a LOT of customization options are behind a pay wall in the ARMAS marketplace, which is overpriced as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The combat comes down to gear. The Meta is spam and pray. SMGs, Assault Rifles, RPGs, and grenades. Being outgeared is a common issue. If one person has a better gun than the rest of your team your team is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. Hit detection isn't pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, getting hit behind walls and cars is common.  I wouldn't recommend this game for anything but the customization. That's the best part of this game, and it's a grind to get anything worth customizing.

But there is also one thing holding me back from this game is that there are no australian servers...... Turning and killing people is SO delayed over here i literaly have to press the turning button 3 seconds in advance for it to even turn and the deaths are so delayed its not funny. Gamersfirst if your reading this PLEASE make an australia server or an oceanic server alot of aussies will play this game if you had that.
4428	0	a	Want to try an MMO that's Free to Play!? This game has some of the best customization out of any game I've ever played. You can customize your character's clothing, appearance, tattoos, and even your car. It's FREE, check it out today!!!  UPDATE (1/1/2016): If I were you, I wouldn't waste your time on APB: Reloaded since it has become a Pay to Win style game. The company that took this game over has changed it from the glory this game once was.   You'd be better off NOT wasting your time with this title.
4429	0	a	dont know if this game is good as the launcher wont work
4430	0	a	I cant even start playing the game so...ya.
4431	0	a	not even worth it i have to download this game twice to get it to run and it crashes my pc which is able to run it not worth the time or effort even if it is a free game its more like free piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

4433	0	a	Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros in this glitchy, slow GTA-Wannabe.
4434	0	a	If you love COD or anything like it and can get down with customizing , this is the game for you.  That being said, i can't stand this game anymore. The set up is awesome, the customization is awesome, the map lay outs are detailed and super expansive. But the matching system is broken. As a newbie you can easily find yourself up against the best of the game right from the start. There are servers dedicated to different player ranks but it hardly matters. The gun you start out with is an ar that might as well be a airsoft. when your enemy comes at you with a bazooka. While the developers have done what they can to make this game fair for everyone they really over looked certain aspects.  Hit boxes are a joke, there are no critcal hit (headshot) areas, your just one big block. oh and even if your character is small, your hit box is still the same size as if you made the largest possible character.  the weapons in the game are exspansive, and while you can TECHNICALLY get any gun that anyone else has, it requires some serious dedication to unlock them all, let alone rent them&lt; (yes RENT) but even then someone always seems to have a better gun than you some how, and with no way of knowing what others are using, good luck guessing what to aim for. Speaking of aim, recoil is HEAVY in this game. sure might make it realistic but when it destorys the point of a weapon. for instance, loads of sniper rifles in this game, problem? none of them are 1 hit kill (which is obviously an attempt to balance the game) but the recoil on them is so heavy you will never get your second killing shot off in time to get your target unless they are inexperianced (which is rare) as such SR are rarly used. the most common gun use you will see are assult rifles, light machine guns, and anything explosive. any other gun is a waste of your time , and of course those are some of the hardest weapons to get the best of. my main beef with this game is the combat, simply from being completly out classed as a new player with no way to train up and become better except to be fodder for everyone else and lose match after match. however i must also state, the driving controls are pretty wonky as well, very easy to flip over your car from taking a slightly too tight turn. Enemies also make heavy use of the slightly broken vehical issues. like being able to blow up your car, with you in it, to get that 1 hit kill. or hiding key items in a spawned car that you cant access and waiting for the timer to tick away. its a pretty low tactic but one that works so well, its common. the last thing i will say is there is a prestige/notority system thats in place. once someone reaches 5 stars on either a bounty is placed on them and the entire other faction can kill them, or at least can try. Which when the 5 star person decides to storm the noob tuturial spawn point there is no one there strong enough or quick enough to stop them and they slaughter every enemy in sight! as they can also kill everyone on the other faction as well. i spent a good 5 minutes dealing with that till one of my factions stronger players came along and put them down. while this game has many makings of fun times, the imbalance issues are just too much for me to over look. and seeing as this game from release is 3 years old, i dont think things will be changing much. 
4435	0	a	Incredibly pay to win, skill has little to do with how much you win. Easily the worst community I've ever seen on any game.
4436	0	a	THIS IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
4437	0	a	Dead game, G1 had a golden opportunity to make it a great game when they got it, over the years it has gone to crap. Hackers took over, and they still are trying to get a grip on it. Population is dead, and G1 doesn't listen to the little bit of player base that is left.
4438	0	a	If you value a game with a matchmaking system dependant on your skill and how well you play based on teamwork criteria, you literally chose the opposite game for those. The game is 1005% pay to win, prove me other wise. Connection issues are almost 100% constant. Developers have no clue what they're doing with matchmaking, I'm using a level 3 gun getting matched with level 5000's with fully body armor and maxed out stats.   Overall uninstalling the game was much more relaxing and rewarding than the actual game, I'd go so far as to say reading the Terms of Service for this game is more rewarding than the actual gameplay itself.
4439	0	a	Honestly, APB: Reloaded itself is great and fun. The game type is entirely unique, in that it's basically criminal gangsters versus lawful gangsters (Criminals vs Enforcers), destroying the city through random missions and the robbery of citizens' belongings by means of ram-raiding shop windows or mugging them on the street. The open world instances are flashy and fun to look at and explore, even if the majority of buildings can't be entered. The game's customization is, and maybe always will be, the best of its class -- if there even is another in that glorious top-tier -- simply because you can make your own theme songs, decals, and more through the in-game editors. Even if you aren't very good at art, you can still enjoy the simplicity of the game's customization, and make complex designs very easily.  The reason I don't recommend this game is because of the company that presently owns it: GamersFirst. Whatever good content they can add is made worthless by one of two means: The slow ranking system, or the simple fact that it's exclusive to the cash shop, making it one of the largest pay-to-wins I've ever played. There's also the major problem of cheaters/hackers, and the terrible security that's presently implemented. Still, I found a way to look past all of that and enjoy the game for about a year, even if the servers rubber-banded every now and then. Unfortunately, that rubber-banding has gotten worse over time, as the servers are simply getting more and more degraded by the second. GamersFirst is incapable of understanding that they need to upgrade these servers, and now the game is in a state where every movement has a 5-second delay, rubber-banding runs rampant, and disconnections occur every 5-10 minutes which won't allow you back on for another 20. GamersFirst does not understand the real ideas behind running a good game besides content, and in that they have ruined the experience of the game completely.  This is not the first good concept they've destroyed. WarRock is another shooter that now belongs to Nexon Europe, and once belonged to GamersFirst. The vehicles in the game are solid, and plays like a free-to-play Battlefield, in its own way. When my friends first told me about WarRock, the first thing they warned me to avoid was the public servers. I asked why and they gave me one answer: hackers. By the time I got that warning, though, I had already joined a public server and saw a flying tank getting destroyed by a glitched helicopter. I quickly left, and played in a private room with my friends, having a great time until the servers suddenly went down. They didn't come back up within half an hour, and we all decided to uninstall the game shortly after.   It saddens me that APB has been ruined by such a terrible company, to the point where I can no longer recommend it. I've heard rumors that Perfect World Entertainment is looking into buying APB: Reloaded from GamersFirst, and I must say that sounds like a far better idea than letting it run on the slowly melting servers it's running on now.

4453	0	a	Until this became 'pay to win' it was a very enjoyable game. I spent many hours with friends running down cons in our pimped out squad cars. I was happy to pay the minor monthly fee back then for that bit of near hackerless fun and no PTW store. I noticed a lot of 'features' cost $ that before the changeover didn't, a way to make an extra buck for the devs I guess.
4454	0	a	its a great game but its frickin pay to win every team i go against im sniped by a gold weapon which has perfect stats so either nerf these weapons or make them rewards because im sick of it. DONT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY  
4455	0	a	Game Status Long Ago: Very Playable, Good Latency  Game Status Now: Unplayable, Horrible Latency   The Latency beats over all the customization with nearly 1000 latency playing normal.  The game is just unplayable now.
4456	0	a	I spent some hefty time with this game, even before it was on steam. It was bad before, and now, worse. I just installed it again today and tried 3 matches. All 3, all Premium vs Non-premium. The animations are still choppy, awkward, with no improvement. Graphic overall, still unpolished as it was 2 years old. The only reason I can possibly think of for one to spend time in this game is for its customization system, but that thing is soo restricted for non-premium (like ridiculously resticted). This is a perfect example of a failed Free to Play model. Don't play this unless you're willing to invest alot of real money, otherwise, you will not have a good time against premium players with all their boons.
4457	0	a	Used to be a good game since I had nothing else to do. Now that I have Csgo, this is utter BS. Dont play this. It is basically a game where people who pay for their guns will always win. Spend a little money and actually get a good game you will like rather than play these free games.

4479	0	a	The game was okay, at first. Open(ish) world, tons of customization, lots of options for starter guns.  Then i played for a while. Missions are dominated by players with money, and the games skill rating matchmaking doesn't factor in Pay to Win guns that are leaps and bounds above what you can buy with in-game currency.  If you have money to blow, i say give it a shot. If you plan on being a free player, i say stay away.
4480	0	a	Played the Original, played the Reboot, played the Reboot of the Reboot, and I can honestly Recommend not to Recommend this game to anyone, not GTA, not Saint Row, not even close, has a lot of frame rate problems, campers, and spawn killers. I think Eve Online has less gankers and that is saying something.

I click start, and a page pops up on Chrome, and the game isn't there.  10/10 would waste time again.  EDIT: I finally got the game up, and it wants me to make an account. Why? Why should I? I don't see why people make you sign up for a game you downloaded through Steam.
4489	0	a	Not worth your time, between random triggerbots and aimbots and not too mention people who decide they dont like you for no intention what so ever report you and state false lies and gamersfirst believes them over true fool proof they have with there fairfight system and block you.  Ps: spend your cash elsewhere
4490	0	a	7 hours, a total of seven hours, and it crashed twice. Once when I was customizing my shoes, and a second time driving down the street. I also died about sixteen times due to lag, as well as flipped 3 cars due to lag. If the game was at ALL stable it would be amazing, the character, car, and tag customization is mind blowingly deep. Made me kind of wish I had any artistic talent what so ever. As it stands I cannot recommend it with how unstable it played, but I really wish I could. Good game, badly held together.
4491	0	a	The biggest pay to win I've ever experienced... Â£24 for a CAR! 1 CAR!! Do not download this, it's simply not fun at all and the developers beg for money so much. Avoid at all costs!
4492	0	a	This game is p2w you can literally just buy the best weapon in the game with money , not even worth playing this game .
4493	0	a	Very laggy, most weapons are obtained through in game purhcases.Needs to be balanced.
4494	0	a	this game does not start after i click start it just does nothing and i cant get on the starter now
4495	0	a	Great now with the new anti-cheat system. Still abit to laggy tho but cannot complain WAY better than a year ago.
4496	0	a	bad drive big bogs :D and were is cover :D
4497	0	a	The player base is in very sad shape. However, the game itself is pretty dang cool. Theres just too many negatives to discuss them all in a short review. Its sad really. Once a great game, with a fair share of problems never getting fixed, took a turn for the worst. I played for a few days after quiting 2 years ago at least. And its absolutely horrible without friends. People like to treat ya like crap.
4498	0	a	Played at launch and didnt mind it although very buggy it was populated and fun. Had about 320hours logged there untill I gave it a break. Came back to the game about a month ago still seems very similar but the population?? Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I always felt like I was playing a single player game not an mmo. Most people I ever found in a district was like 5 no matter where I went. The sheer lack of population is the reason im not recommending, if more people were playing its a damn fun multiplayer experience but as it is now its a boring ghost town so dont bother.
4499	0	a	One of the best games I ever played but G1 goes hand in hand with the cheaters and alot of the cheaters are from the bigger clans and are friends with moderators etc so they wont get banned. I got banned for abusive language for life and switched to APB Innova a russian server, less cheater more fun.
4500	0	a	I have put about 900 hours in this game. Now, after 2 years, I gave it another try. Absolutely nothing has changed. Couple of new contacts and that's it. Game still has a lot of cheaters, still p2w as ever, still terrible community etc...  First thing you see when you log in is Armas marketplace window popping up trying to shove all the expensive p2w stuff and cosmetics in your face. Absolutely ridiculous.  Still terrible matchmaking, gold disctricts are empty, the cars that were before exclusive for crims are now available to enforcers and vice versa (â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money grab much G1!?), still unbalanced weapons, still hitreg problems, still no new servers, nothing... The only thing that this game does is releasing new armas content so people can spend more money.  One thing I have to admit, it's one of those games that are very addictive. It's a fun game to play if you can ignore all the issues, so it's a shame devs are not interested to make something of this game. So, for everyone that has never played this game, don't do it. Trust me, save your sanity. The game is very hard to get into for newcomers and community is absolutely terrible. I have never seen anyone helping new players in this game, true talk.
4501	0	a	It used to be an amazing game with great potential, but G1 sunk it down year after year &amp; without any improvement at all, sinking the game further down while releasing new armas content (real life money) reskin weapons only nothing new at all, nothing new for F2P, just P2P content all the way &amp; no promises they make are being kept on improving anything at all...  If you're new to this game i STRONGLY recommend you to stay as far away as you can, if you're thinking of coming back to the game again just look the other way... if you never raged before in your life this game will make you rage everywhere if you play it.
4502	0	a	took 1h to download played 10min got bored 0/10 would never play agian and btw such hackers .-. 
4503	0	a	WTF is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!! dont just dont.
4504	0	a	well fkn funny i wainted for it to download 5 hours and it dont even work becuse my Grapic card is too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good ... Not recomended it u have a good Grapic card ...
4505	0	a	i cant play this game it just black screens
4506	0	a	GamersFirst is a terrible moneygrabbing company. Despite APB:Reloaded having fun gameplay and a good somewhat worthwhile (and repetetive) experience it is a 'Pay to Win' multiplayer game, where the more money you put into it the more you'll be favoured in-game. Be warned, if you do decide to pay to win, they can and most likely will take your privelages away with a delicious ban, it happened to the infamous me, twice.   Play this game at your own risk, feel free to play it even more when it's taken over by a different company that's somewhat more involved with their community.
4507	0	a	I've played this when they first came out, even before on steam. THE GAME I LOVED IT!!!! COULD not stop playing both of the sides for 2weeks!! Then hackers started poppin out of building and walls. I waited to see if they will be gone  or atelast most of em but NOPE!!!!! gets worse n worse.. so i said F*K this n never played this EVER again.
4508	0	a	Total control of charactor creation look is kinda cool. The game itself is a bit clunky and the shooter part is annoying. It lags some and there are plenty of people out there with exploits. I got addicted to this game until I finally realized it's full of 12yo's or people with the mind of a 12yo and all anyone wants to do is throw dumb insults around. The only thing about it that makes it worth downloading is that it's free to play.
4509	0	a	Pay to win.
4510	0	a	It was fun. I would recommend it if it wasnt P2W now. Sadly they ****ed up this game. It was a great game tho !
4511	0	a	expect admin abuse from this one
4512	0	a	if you play have fun going to lag hell , dont recommend
4513	0	a	i like this game a lot but the thing i hate most is not being able to drive i joined a server that had a a 284 ms i cant drive shoot or do anything really so i cant play unless theres a server close to me.
4514	0	a	How to play this game: -install -check if there are still only timed weapons for f2p -if yes, uninstall and try again next year  cya in 2017
4515	0	a	piece of crap
4516	0	a	Spent half an hour in the character customization menu making sure I have the best looking jugs and nostrils in the game, entered a District, tried to do the tutorial, got gunned down by another player. Re-spawned. Tried to make sense of the map. Got gunned down. Re-spawned. Tried to do a tutorial, was prompted to press K. Pressed K, received a mission. Got called a noob and was told to go fornicate off and die. Got gunned down.  Uninstalled the game.
4517	0	a	The game was fine at first, But then it got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. When you are doing missions, Its super unbalanced. 2 robbers vs 5 cops. Unfair. Also it shouldnt be 'Noobs vs Pros'. The cops are always super OP and the criminals are weak. And the loading time is terrible. I have a great PC but it take ages for this game to load. It doesnt even have very good stuff in it so it isnt worth ut.
4518	0	a	Can't even start the game,please fix this problem.
4519	0	a	Alot of hackers , couldn't play or do a thing -.-
4520	0	a	This game has been rendered a 'Play only if you can't afford GTA 5, Fee to Pay game'.
4521	0	a	because the car swallowed my memes so crie if u ned 2
4522	0	a	it sucks cant even play can anybody tell me how to do this
4523	0	a	It is basically GTA's mentally handicapped cousin.
4524	0	a	Its sad this game is a shadow of its former glory. Kids with credit cards buying the best weapons, hackers, community is now crap...
4525	0	a	Copy of GTA, no very good.
4526	0	a	People with premium weapons usually win this game. noobs get matched against experienced players constantly. Overall, not a very good f2p game
4527	0	a	+Customization -Everything else
4528	0	a	Practically the best Pay to Win game ever! If you're broke, you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed! :D
4529	0	a	10/10 would uninstall again
4530	0	a	Pay to win but in its own fashion, its one of those games were u cant tell if u will like it untill u play it allthough i did not like it would i recommend it, no but u may still like it.
4531	0	a	Pay to win crap...ad that is all i have to say. Pay to Win or pay to do anthing really..cant customize anything unless you shell out cash
4532	0	a	Game used to be good now its pay to win and Full of Hackers...Now that is is going to be released on PS4 and XboxOne forget about playing PC version the Devs have given up and most of the time FairFight doesnt do anything about the Hackers..
4533	0	a	Can--Can I make a review without being shot in the face by my team mates? Yes? O-Okay.. *Clears my throat* This is my first review so live with me here..  OKAY! I'm going to go through MY experience with this game. It was......Meh. This game is about Criminals wanting to take control of the city, and basically the cops issues Marshal law, so they kill the criminals. You get the Idea, anyways, when I first started, I LOVED, the character maker. SO much you can do to your Character, like adding Tattoos, scars, changing hair, eye, and even nail colour. I made a pretty Bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ enforcer guy, and he's pretty sweet, but I'm rambling. So, you spawn in, right? No Idea what the hell to do, so you just ask around on the chat box, and IMMEDIETLY get cussed out by some white trash wannabe trying to be cool. So, I shrugged it off and learned what to do, making my way up. Now, get this, you can buy stuff with ingame money and real money. Like..Gear that you can KEEP. Guns, no, They expire in 10 days and you have to RE-buy them for like, 1000 in game money. (Price range may Vary) But, back to the community in this game. If you're looking for back stabbing team mates who shoot you in the face, White trash gangsta kids talking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to you, and all around a community that makes the Call of Duty one look like they're nice people? THEN THIS GAME IS THE GAME FOR YOU, SIR-AND OR- MADAM! Thing is, this game gets oddly addictive when you want to keep your character looking badass, But the money is so difficult to get because most of the time, New people at the game have no chance to do good in this game at the start. You're instantly put with people who have better guns and gear, to kill your sweet butt with. And in the end you end up Raging your heart out cause your team mate shoots you with a double barrel in the back cause you tried to play the damn objective! The only Reason why I keep the game, IS FOR THE CHARACTER COUSTIMIZATION! Only reason. Right there. Other than that this game is a Putrid mess of hackers, trash talkers, 12 year olds who scream into the damn mic every five seconds, and back stabbing team mates! I rate this game.....   3/10!  Ony reason to keep: To make and improve your Character.  That is all! I hope you found my review some what helpful! Peace!
4534	0	a	I played APB: Reloaded via the Gamersfirst launcher and at first I was in love.  The missions were challenging when you had to fight other players, the customization really let you show your creative side, and the music was amazing. You can even hear the music of players driving near you.  But the rental guns really got annoying considering the original APB had permanant weapons. The cops vs robbers theme was cool but the ratio is way off, there are far more criminals which makes sense considering criminals can make money about 4 times faster than enforcers.  Also there is or was little in terms of balance. You would often see gold ranked players matched against silver or even bronze players, resulting in a massacre.  All of the above was tolerable until the Armas Market was introduced. Offering permenant cars and weapons, all of which are slightly better than their 'free' counterparts, the Armas Market gives spenders a noticeable edge and ruins the game in my opinion.  Imagine getting matched up against a player, you have the exact same guns except theirs is cash shop (you can tell by the gold gun icon) and they have nearly tripple your firing range and seem to be able to kill you in half the shots despite wearing heavy kevlar.   To sum it up. APB: Reloaded is a relaunch of a failed P2P game with beautiful graphics, great character and car customization, and a horrible cash shop model. Due to the Armas Market, I cannot recomend this game to people looking for a good PVP mmo.
4535	0	a	APB Reloaded a fps good for anyone that wants to play a cops vs criminals,Awesome gameplay nice graphics good music and sound its almost perfect but its the wors game I`ve ever played cause its unplayable you cant spawn in a district or play only 1 hour cause the game crashes every 1 second I dont know why cause I played it before and it was better and had no crashes now it fells like the game is a beta not a full game because of the many crashes I tried everithing turning down the graphics and resolution and didnt work so Dont waste time on this game
4536	0	a	IT was an ok game until i started getting killed by the same person over and over agian pz fix this to where if you get killed killed so many times that it activates the heild i would reconmend this game if you just fixed it
4537	0	a	bought a car in cash 20euro....the second day 40%sell......don't buy anything!
4538	0	a	pay to win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4539	0	a	Don't bother.
4540	0	a	if you seriously like this game there is something wrong with you lmao
4541	0	a	This game is a pay to win ClusterFork.  It's not enjoyable, and in no means can I recommend it to you and feel good about doing so.  In my opinion, I'd say avoid this game, it's not worth the time.
4542	0	a	3 Words can discribe this game Pay 2 Win.. No really it's a P2W game and the weapons they sell are extreamly expensive and as far as I can tell the Devs favor on the Criminal side duo to some seriouse unbalance LTL weapons that take 8 hits just to stun a person but it takes 3 hits with a normal weapon to kill you seems a little on the BS side if you tell me. I would not bother downloading the game
4543	0	a	S H I T
4544	0	a	This game and the community itself has become cancer. Stay away from it
4545	0	a	  It seems like a good game but i can't play it because the servers are amazingly bad. Unplayable.
4546	0	a	This game has good customization, and okay gameplay. it however has one of the worst communitys in gaming history, somewhere between ark and LoL. i tried one mission recently and it was easily greifed by a high level player that kept killing us. why can you even kill your own teammates during a mission vital for leveling up? thats just asking for trolls.  on top of that if you want anythign beyond the starter that isn't clothes, be prepared to dish out real money. and they're not cheap. and they're not permenent. so you pay $20 for a gun that only last 90 days at max, and the time costs extra. the guns you get from ingame currency are only 7 days max, so pretty much worthless.  the fact that a high and max level player can join a level 1 mission is also what ruins the game. imagine trying to win a mission thats supposed to be easy agenst a player with a rocketlauncher that one hits you. thats this game in a nutshell.
4547	0	a	The worst tutorial
4548	0	a	This game is an awesome idea,but there is just too many mistakes made in it.  First of all its complicated,atleast it was for me. No real tutorial rather than text. Pro players in starter area. Glitches. Pay to win.
4549	0	a	only a few words to describe it   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing wasted my time and money shouldve played dota or  someshit than this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game    KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK DEV
4550	0	a	  P2W simple as that. Wouldn't recommend it, the game it self is good visually looking but the only fun you'll get out of this is the customization, unless you're going to pay. If not then don't bother, you'll get easily outmatched by the op paid for weapons and super cars the enemies have compared to your very limited options (you don't wanna know how much more access p2p players have compared to you as a f2p). Also the community and car handeling in this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing aweful, just trash.
4551	0	a	Hungry â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing devs and wasted my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing money.  1, This game just wasted my money.I regret playing this game. u messed up and then u need to create a new account and play again and over and over again.  2.â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Graphics Even with Max Settings.  3.No F2P servers.  4.2op players is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing unfair.  5.uninstalling the game is so good.  6.made me break my computer.  7.i rate this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥/  1/10 would â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing uninstall this game again.  
4552	0	a	This a great game, but the community sucks... And the Support don't care about you just care about your pocket if you have money they will accept it, but if you need help they will just ignore you or say that they can't do nothing for you. So that's why I don't like this game, but I'm already addicted, I'm getting cancer and bla bla... So for your life if you want to be happy and get a family one day don't play this game.
4553	0	a	Dont waste your time on this stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...
4554	0	a	I bought this game on original release.... why should i pay to play?
4555	0	a	I cant start up APB Reloaded I have installed everything. When my PC asks for permission to run the app I press yes and then nothing else happens.HELP!?
4556	0	a	This game was awesome back in the day. But now.. no I dont recommend it at all. +for customization - for everything else
4557	0	a	Not a good game... after waiting and waiting for it to download it didn't work... it asked me to download it again from THEIR website... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ download, free to play equivalent of GTA :(
4558	0	a	Bad game is BAD!!!! 0/100
4559	0	a	Matches people who have been playing the game for a few minutes against those who have been playing for hundreds of hours. Matchmaking is the most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing I've ever seen, good luck getting matched against people you might actually be able to beat.
4560	0	a	I enjoyed this game when I first loaded it. It has great graphics. Great controls. Takes a bit of time to get used to, but once you do, it is great fun. The problem is the community. And this is not a one player game, so you are forced to play 'with the community'. The community in question is horrible. They kill their own team members. Evidently, you aren't supposed to go for objectives until the enemy is right there. Never heard of such a thing. And if you do, your own teammates kill you. Which I can get over. No biggie. But they are RUDE. From their mouths, to how they treat one another. Disgusting behavior. And after I saw the garbage that was in the game, and was treated like crap, I became the garbage which I regret, and went to their level. So although the game itself is fun, the community certainly isn't. And since you have no choice but to play with the community, as it's not a 1 player game, you are stuck, and this makes this game not recommendable.
4561	0	a	got no play time on this due to me playing APB without steam up.. I have 1000 hours gameplay over 3 years and yet no improvments just gets worse and worse with every 'promise' that they will update the servers, ban hackers, update the game and even just make it fun like it used to be but nope, nothing. Servers havent been updated in years, hackers are everywhere and can just re-roll.. this means that they just make a new account and then start playing again.. it isn't fun anymore, all games are one sided, all guns are only good in certain areas and you have to change so fast to adapt to the game area where the objective is and in some games you switch your weapon and its already changed again because you've been put against 5 maxed rank players and you have low ranks that are all under 50 that have no clue.   Other games can be you with max ranks against low ranks that are all gold threat (highest threat in game) which are very 'dodgy' to begin with even though making a new character keeps the same threat, for example you could have a max rank enforcer then make a new criminal account and yet at rank 1 it will share the same threat level, which would be gold for example. This would be fair enough but now-a-days its an obvious way of seeing if they're not legit. Most are hackers now-a-days even with 'fairfight' which does nothing, they will hack a few games and by the time they get reported they've gone offline and cannot be checked at. Also makes it fun when you can even get into a game with a developer and yet they still hack! you cant even message the developer dirrectly due to not being able too which is always great! :)   Developers are just money hungry, 'new' weapons aren't 'new' they are simply re-skins of other guns that you can get if you want to try and grind against hackers to buy the guns which are for 7 days only and by then you dont usually make enough to get back to cover what you spent on the gun.. It may be F2P but it is certainly P2W now.. Dont bother, games been going down the toilet for the last couple of years and now they've milked enough to bring it to consoles for more mugs to 'play' until its hacked there. Avoid it.. Dev's are useless money grabbers who do not care for the game only for the paycheck at the end of the month.
4562	0	a	I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game 3 times, I am not very good at FPS but the it seems like the only people who play this game have perfect 100% accuracy and they can tell when I am coming around corners its amazing and frustrating. I reccomend not even playing this game as you will have fun up until you hit those types of players that just absolutely know where you are and can kill you in seconds with hard shots, crazy game super fun but i dont believe in the anti cheat system of this game.
4563	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4564	0	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ED
4565	0	a	God Awful. I have been playing this game for like a month or 2 and it f***ing sucks. Sure you can customize weapons and cars n' stuff but the online gameplay just sucks. I ready in and wait 30 minutes for a mission and my other teammates wont even do the mission, they kill me when I try doing something(friendly fire X_X) and tell me they're 'priming'(from what i heard is not doing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ untill a police force comes to the scene) and yelled at me for being a noob. I as a rookie game developer tell the developers 'you're doing great with customization, but PLEASE set up a better matchmaking system'. for the players i say 'Just play GTA Online, this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ just sucks'. oh and one more thing developers 'WHY THE HELL CAN I ONLY RENT GUNS'. thank you
4566	0	a	My ex boyfriend had me play this with him. I'm not really into shooter games or anything except Half Life and similar stuff, and back then I didn't even have interest in Half Life. So you can imagine the culture shock I went through when I finally installed this game. He had us play as thieves and I must say now that I look at it it's like an MMO version of GTA. For me, everything we did didn't sit right with me and every time we encountered anyone else all they wanted to do was either shoot us or run us over with a car. From what I remember you're stuck being a gruff looking human and the only customization after making your character is expensive clothing at overcrowded stores. And from what I could tell, everyone played the game like an idiot, unable to drive without aiming at people/fences and if they were the police, all they did was shoot at you until you were dead. I don't even know if that's how they're even supposed to do their job because I never got the chance to play as one as I got fed up with trying to play something that I really didn't like.  TL;DR: If you like to go 'LOOOOOLLLLL â™¥â™¥â™¥' then this game is perfect for you and you will find everyone else in there to be like you. If you're any other person with an actual sense of decency, you more than likely will hate it and its community.
4567	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, way 2 laggy, the idea is great, but the game itself is terrible

4571	0	a	While they are not bad, this game's graphics require more hardware power than games that look twice as good(for example FarCry3) I also found that controlling the car was quite difficult with the keyboard making the game (to me at least) nearly unplayable.

4579	0	a	shait shait why the hell you put noobs with pros ?? idiots
4580	0	a	God, where to start....  First off, the idea of this game is beautiful, cops vs criminals in a sprawling city based area? Absolutely amazing. However, when I played this game, back maybe about a year ago, you'd see plenty of new players, you know bronze peeps. But now, it's like, everyone is paying to win very hard, and are either golds or silvers, and you very rearely see bronze peope anymore. If you wash away the p2w paint plastered over this game, and just think about it's concept, you can see that the game is well thought out, and even properly executed, but poorly maintained. I don't mean in the sense of bugs or glitches, but losing just about every single mission with matchmaking like, 2 silvers vs 2 golds. It's unbearable, but I keep coming back for the concept of this game, there is nothing quite like this game, I love rollin through town on my customized Dolton, with absolutely no upgrades, and I still enjoy the game from time to time. Honestly, the game is fine, but the devs can't stick this pay to win stuff on just about every single thing in this game.  No new player should have access to equipment vet players have. This game is fun, if you like CopsVsRobbers, then try it out. And appreciate the games concept, and not the playability.

4582	0	a	You CAN have some fun while playing with friends, but as of 2015 it's waaay better to just get yourself GTA V and play Online with your buddies
4583	0	a	TLDR:    Great ideas bought for naught after bankrupcy and then turned into pay2win hell with no actual game improvements since the take over.     Once upon a time, some developers made a game with huge potential and many nice concepts. Unfortunately they went bankrupt before the potential could be fulfilled. Luckily another compay bought the game and turned it into a more profitable one!.... By making it pay2win, thus securing the games future, at the low price of of the game turning from a fun yet incomplete game into a horrible pay2win game, which is also incomplete.  I did enjoy myself for a while, but as soon as it dawned on me that no amount of grinding would put me on par with the pay2win crowd, I lost interest and moved on.
4584	0	a	What a waste of space on my disk. Where should I start? Graphics are terrible. Even for a f2p game they are bad, and I know how to make graphics for games so they just completly failed there. Most important issue is the game play on it's own. 3rd Person camera isn't the best, driving cars is just a joke - Even ps2 games had better driving controls than this. Maybe add some kind of objectives or mission that new players would understand? If they want to fix a game a new game engine would be a good start. If this game will get to a level of sainrows 3 or gta IV I will play but since I doubt it will ever happen you are getting negative review. Beside paying Â£22 for a dlc for this game is like a sin. From the money you made you should be able to make a good game, not a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like that. I will not go even to mentioning that the game crashes on first lanch and that I have to go to the task manager to fix it. 2/10

4587	0	a	Hack fest of RU players   Great game had some very good days playing it but it didn't last.  Cars are very cool custom is uber mission's work well over all it's a great game and free too boot. But will not play or point poeple to it till they sort out the hackers.
4588	0	a	fun at first, quickly turns to total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ toward the endgame get it if you want to troll one of the most autistic playerbases in gaming, if you actually want a good time look elsewhere
4589	0	a	This game has one of the best player and outfit creating tools in any game. And its a shame really because thats the only good thing about this game. First of all and biggest complaints is people using hacks. I would say about 35% of players are actively using hacks such as aimbots. Sure some get banned but in a free to play game were a cheater simply has to make a new account and is back into the game aimboting away. I have spent many hours in this game and I can say the only enjoyment i get is making cool designs and hanging out in the social district. Actually playing this game is a big no no with all the aimbots. Stack all that with the most wallet gougeing pay to win model you can think of and you have APB  1/10 and it would be a zero if not for the amazing ability to customize characters. but they found a way to make you have to pay for that as well
4590	0	a	I played this game quite a bit a ways back, I think about 6 months ago. And then I stopped.. I don't remember what frustrated me so much that I stopped, so I decided to give it another go. 1. EXTREMELY long load times. 2. disconnection problems (VERY BAD). we're talking every 2 or 3 minutes getting disconnected and dealing with 4 minutes worth of loading to get fully connected again, just to be disconnected 2 or 3 minutes later once again. 10 disconnects in 1 hour, total play time 11 minutes maybe in 1 hour, 20 minutes in 2 hours?? SOOOOO BUGGY!!! I tried using steam to verify installation, and then I also did the repair option on the APB launcher.. 5 times. Have not found it to fix the problem of constantly disconnecting from the game every 2 or 3 minutes. Makes the game completely un-playable for me. What a complete waste of 2 hours for me trying to get any play time on this. Seriously BUGGED. They have had PLENTY of time to fix the problems with this game, but it's performance indicates that they have no intention to. Back months &amp; months ago it was LESS buggy than it is now. I actually have 240 hours logged on this game from back then. It was still buggy then, but less so. However, they must have screwed something else up since then. Others may not have the same problems as me, but is unplayable for me due to constant disconnects.... something I am not experiencing with other game titles.
4591	0	a	This game at the first release was a GTA online free to play fix for those who didnt have a console to play GTA on. My friend introduced this to me a long time ago and it initally seemed like a fun game. Tons of customization, open world city, decent ranking system, and some pretty memorable fights. Though as the game has changed, so has my feelings for it. ABP has become a buy-to-win unfriendly tumor of a game to which I cant remotely enjoy anymore. The worse thing about this game is basically who ever buys the $40 assault rifle through micro transactions along with the $35 rocket launcher is now deemed invincible. APB has become a sandbox that requires you to buy quality weapons with real time money or else you will be the punching bag of the game. My friend bought me a $20 assualt rifle and let me tell you that made everything a lot easier... but that didnt help long since more people would buy the $40 ones. I dont consider a game fun when it requires equipment quality over skill, it shouldnt be who ever has the most expensive gun wins every match, rather it should be who ever has the keenest shot or the quickest reflexes and a quality weapon helps to a degree. sorry for this poorly written review but i do not recommend playing APB, its simply a cluster of microtransaction idiots with completely decked out assault rifles and RPG's
4592	0	a	Punkbuster always kicks me. Horrible Security Right There.
4593	0	a	Everyone is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and the missions are not understandable. And the animations are horrible. DayZ is better then this and Dayz sucks!

4595	0	a	The ranking system is crap. You can't rank to gold without being put abck to silver even after a win streak. They don't ban hackers. Don't play this game.
4596	0	a	The character creation is awesome, but that's about it. I just dont even want to think about it. It's pretty damn bad. It could be so much more if it were in better hands. Sorry to everyone who worked on it.
4597	0	a	i can play the game but it keeps crashing and i dont know why
4598	0	a	thank you it say im play the game whem i arent and i cant uninstall it or play a different game
4599	0	a	Literally the worst game.
4600	0	a	Maybe, just maybe I might've shelled out a few dollars for APBR. You know, so I would actually have fun, instead of getting constantly merked with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ starting gear the games gives you. 'Why not? People are killing me in three â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing shots', I said.     To make a long story short, If I'm gonna pay $40 for in game weapons, I had better get 40 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing guns, not 1.
4601	0	a	I honestly would NOT recommend this game to new players!   Some Resons Why:  -No balancing system at all -Pay to win -Takes f*ck loads of hours to get a gun decent enough to fight people with -Did i mention pay to win? Oh i did? Its soo pay to win i put it again -Grindy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥kkk!!! (it takes wayyy to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing long to get CLOTHES! CLOTHES FOR GOD'S SAKE)  Here are some things that happen in this game.  Only played for about 7 hours, get on to have some fun expecting a balace system, gets into a match, gets â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed as soon as it loads up. Holds tab, finds out that they are MUCH higher in rank. Loses match.  If you enjoy all of these things...go ahead and play this game. I still probably will but i still hold firm on saying that new players should NOT play this game unless there is a friend who can guide them.
4602	0	a	This game is absolute piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and a waste of time. It takes 5 hours to load 2 seconds to exit and 5 hours to quit the game.... fk this mothafkin piece of time wasting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4603	0	a	not good at all
4604	0	a	This game is strictly pay-2-win  The only way you can win is spend money to get a decent weapon, or be the best player in the world. 
4605	0	a	Major hackfest + pay to win in every way possible, it used to be a great game but the devs got greedy... avoid at all costs if you wish to keep your sanity in check.
4606	0	a	couldn't even get it to work had to restart pc to close it dont download
4607	0	a	Doesn't even launch. Can confirm that the uninstall button works. 9.3/14.8.
4608	0	a	PAY WALL that is all!!!!!!
4609	0	a	Great game, lots of hours on it, yes I did pay a bit which was totally worth it-not to win with paids guns, in fact it was other stuff which doesnt matter, but 2 years ago I randomly got banned. I know more than half of the people who say 'got banned for no reason' are just mad for getting legit banned, but one common sense I would add to my ban argument is the fact that I paid enough money to be smart and not cheat knowing I would get banned sooner or later. Used to by 10/10, 0/10 now..
4610	0	a	cuz the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wont play cuz i dont have the right graphics card so yea peace of shir steam ur a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing shity gaaming think i made i wait three hours for the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to download then it wont â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play so im gald it was free cuz i would br getting my money back
4611	0	a	do not go near this game, hackers the likes of which makes WoW looks safe. Pay to win doesnt even cut it, its literally pay to play. if you dont spend large amounts of $$ you will not be able to do anything as every aspect of this game is tailored to making non paying players (even those who originally paid for the game) heavily inferior to those whom are willing to pay.

4619	0	a	The game is so ugly!! How to hack my pc can't get on low damn 30 fps! That FPS drops and lagg!!  To start the game! That is during like 88 hour!! Pay To Play game!!! A lot of bullcrap!! Why are there womans in the game!!! Everybody knows they are smaller en harder to hit in fights!! Cutscnene's, crap!! Loadings screen also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ie girls! People thinking I am watching porn...
4620	0	a	This a great game, but the community sucks... And the Support don't care about you just care about your pocket if you have money they will accept it, but if you need help they will just ignore you or say that they can't do nothing for you. So that's why I don't like this game, but I'm already addicted, I'm getting cancer and bla bla... So for your life if you want to be happy and get a family one day don't play this game.
4621	0	a	This game has good customization, and okay gameplay. it however has one of the worst communitys in gaming history, somewhere between ark and LoL. i tried one mission recently and it was easily greifed by a high level player that kept killing us. why can you even kill your own teammates during a mission vital for leveling up? thats just asking for trolls.  on top of that if you want anythign beyond the starter that isn't clothes, be prepared to dish out real money. and they're not cheap. and they're not permenent. so you pay $20 for a gun that only last 90 days at max, and the time costs extra. the guns you get from ingame currency are only 7 days max, so pretty much worthless.  the fact that a high and max level player can join a level 1 mission is also what ruins the game. imagine trying to win a mission thats supposed to be easy agenst a player with a rocketlauncher that one hits you. thats this game in a nutshell.
4622	0	a	Best example of a pay-to-win I have ever witnessed.
4623	0	a	Me and my friend tried playing it , well wasn't very fun . P2W
4624	0	a	I HOPE THIS GAME CRASHES all it is a pay to win â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and thats unfair to people that cant aford it why dont they make 2 servers one for paying people and one for non paying people
4625	0	a	Used to be fun :( Community=toxic Devs=money hungry Waste of time and money to play it now.
4626	0	a	Pay to win.
4627	0	a	I have about 500 hours on this game and I can say at the start it is really pay 2 win but later on the Weapons you are able to modify can be WAY better than the Premium Weapons.If you dont have money for GTA 5 and look for an alternative....Dont get this game it will cost more than GTA 5 later on but if you have friend definitly play this Game! Anyway a Dislike because of the Prices!!!
4628	0	a	Game Status Long Ago: Very Playable, Good Latency  Game Status Now: Unplayable, Horrible Latency   The Latency beats over all the customization with nearly 1000 latency playing normal.  The game is just unplayable now.
4629	0	a	I will say this game has the best customization in a game I have ever seen! but as for gameplay goes, driving in this game is horrible it's like every car is on ice being a free game as well has invited a lot of hackers to play and the game is just dead now.  Don't waste your time.
4630	0	a	I've put a few weeks into this game.  The missions are good and varied. The customization is pretty decent as well. Though, a LOT of customization options are behind a pay wall in the ARMAS marketplace, which is overpriced as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The combat comes down to gear. The Meta is spam and pray. SMGs, Assault Rifles, RPGs, and grenades. Being outgeared is a common issue. If one person has a better gun than the rest of your team your team is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed. Hit detection isn't pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, getting hit behind walls and cars is common.  I wouldn't recommend this game for anything but the customization. That's the best part of this game, and it's a grind to get anything worth customizing.

4634	0	a	the video hyped it up and in game it was a let down
4635	0	a	An empty shell of my favorite game. Overrun by hackers and bots.
4636	0	a	Oh APB, the years I've spent playing. LAGGGGG. This game is the definition of bittersweet. Customization is the best thing this game has going for it. Create your own music, death themes(can be very annoying), cusomize your cars and customize your player(hair, height, weight, tatoos, ect...). This game has its own little producing software that isn't the best, but worth messing around with. The concept of this game is still great even though the exicution is terrible. There is too much wrong about this game but the worst thing about this game is the community. The missions are repetitive with no real storyline unless you want to read about the story when you level up contacts through the in game mail system. Any gun that give and advantage of course are all P2W exect a few that you have to grind for and buy from the marketplace where players can trade/sell guns, cars, songs, death themes, and logos(more that I can't remember atm). Their subscription is called premium and gives you basically 100% more in came currency and experience towards leveling up contacts(how you unlock non p2w items) The winning team of the mission only really matters who wins the final portion of the mission unless your team sucks much more that the opponents. Matchmaking is terrible although there are not enough players to really balance it. Spawn points can be very frustrating and much bs for the other team most of the time. After years of playing this game, I can say I've wasted hours just to unlock the overpowered nano automatic pistol. Once I obtained this goal, I uninstalled after really giving the game a chance. I cant reccomend this game for anyone to play because it is such a let down and pro players will give you your @$$ on a platter. The devs have promised a game engine update and have not done so. It is well over a year overdue. RIP APB it was fun while it lasted...

4643	0	a	Missions always favor the Criminals.  Crim gets to back a van into their objective? That means I HAVE TO CLIMB A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING TOWER TO GET TO MY OBJECTIVE.  I have to guard an objective for 5 minutes? That means THE CRIMINALS ONLY HAVE TO TOUCH IT ONCE TO WIN.  I have to fight for half the mission against a team of snipers to get one open field objective? That means THE NEXT 3 OBJECTIVE WILL BE IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT.  I have to drive all the way across the map? That means THE CRIMINALS ARE ALREADY THERE.  The entire game is designed to benefit criminals.   DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME
4644	0	a	Made a break from this game few moths ago .. I was max level.. Didn't start again P2W and full of cheaters .. Try h1z1 .. Oh I remember how whenever we start a match we would see a guy on enemy team with oca nano .. P2W gun .. We just give up at that point :D
4645	0	a	I spent some hefty time with this game, even before it was on steam. It was bad before, and now, worse. I just installed it again today and tried 3 matches. All 3, all Premium vs Non-premium. The animations are still choppy, awkward, with no improvement. Graphic overall, still unpolished as it was 2 years old. The only reason I can possibly think of for one to spend time in this game is for its customization system, but that thing is soo restricted for non-premium (like ridiculously resticted). This is a perfect example of a failed Free to Play model. Don't play this unless you're willing to invest alot of real money, otherwise, you will not have a good time against premium players with all their boons.
4646	0	a	This game is pretty awful. There is virtually no one on the servers. The game itself has a lot of unrealistic physics and gameplay is pretty choppy. The character creation menus are annoying and tedious to work with. Even the tutorial is boring and virtually helpless.. Not a fun game to play.
4647	0	a	Extrememly pay to win, can't even play the game since everyone has much better guns, vehicles and clothing, once you drive around the city running down citizens it's no longer fun.
4648	0	a	I regret what i've said after a year of playing this game. It used to be good, now it's full of hackers and cheaters. Not a great game to play anymore.....
4649	0	a	A dumbed-down and broken version of Saints Row.
4650	0	a	By far the worst game 'on the market'. It has easily crumbled to ruins after what the current leaders have done to this game. They let it die and they ruined so much behind it. It used to be a fun, great, addicting game. But now it's a struggle just to even attempt to play the game. The issues that are presented are overwhelmingly frustrating. Let's talk about these flaws.  The connection issues that arose as of late making the game unbearable. The server has some serious kind of issues where the game freezes, your ping spikes up anywhere from 1-200 at this exact moment, your FPS drops up to 50% or more, and you start teleporting or 'rubber banding'. I have never, never in my entire life as a gamer, played an online game that had connections issues this bad. These spikes occur a few times throughout the minute, ranging from a couple to maybe 10 or even more.  Next, we get into the development of the game and who's behind it. Basically, the development is non-existant. This game has barley changed over the course of years. The original developers that had heart and care to make this game great and work on have been gone for quite a long time. We are presented with MEDIOCRE updates time and time again. The only updates that do come out take much too long and bring content that is meaningless. The big picture of this game is a complete failure. A new engine upgrade has been in the works for what, close to two years? Where is that development? We get pictures and false promises. False promises is all that this game is made of. The dev team is quite pathetic no matter what the size. I know teenagers that would do a better job with their amateur development skills in less than 3/4 of the then that of APB devs. And those devs that did stay up until recently are leaving to pursue better things.  There is simply no creativity left. There is nothing left. The game has no quality, it isn't fun to play. It's dying and it's been dying.  In game there are so many issues, so many things that need tweaking. The updates that we do get are horrible and frowned upon by the community time and time again. Lots of aspects in the game that are flawed, don't make sense. Bugs, glitches, stuff that has been here for YEARS completely ignored. Lots of cries that were never heard or reached out to. This is negligence at it's finest. The player never had a say in anything.  They attempted to merge the districts together in order to 'better' matchmaking and open more opportunities. However this was the start of all of the connection issues and the real death of this game. Even with the merge, the servers are very much dead. They have less players than the servers had alone before the merge.  This alone paints the picture of how this game has been going downhill.  Time and time again they neglect their fans that have been loyal all this time. And we get nothing at all in return. Customer support has forever been non existant and they really won't care to help you no matter what kind of issues you have. I have been faced with this multiple times. Gamersfirst staff only care about pushing more sales and more 'joker mystery boxes' because they think this is where the appeal lies. They only ever cared about the money. And nothing else. We are all bent over with our knee-pads on and sodomized terribly to this company.  Tiggs was the worst thing that ever happened to this game. I was never even slightly fond of her. She is just a muppet and her personality, tactics, and loyalties are a disgrace to the game. Why, out of all people, her? Just take a good look at this person and realize that she was a mistake.  Today stands the day where I lost everything I had for this game. There was a time I was so addicted I left my life behind for this game. A time where I considered this the best game of all time for how unique and creative it was, different for the time. It was that fun and addicting. However that is no longer. And if I were to rate this game today as it stands, I would give it maybe a 2.5/10. I even think the worst multiplayer game of all time (Infestation Survivor Stories) puts this game to shame.  I honestly hope that this game dies very soon or gets a major overhaul with a complete new owner and staff. But that won't. Once this game dies it will be taken into private hands and modded by fans that will make the game great again.

4652	0	a	i can not sigh up
4653	0	a	I have over 3000 hours of gameplay in this and I can surely 'Not recommend' this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's unfair unless you are living next to the server with a macro mouse. The devs of this game are dumb and they don't care about server freezing and latency issues.
4654	0	a	its bad... granted ive only played for about 2hrs, but.... its so bad. cars? bad. players? bad. Community? really bad. when driving a car, trying to steer the bloody thing takes forever, like turning a yaught or however you spell that. its guns are generic and you'll easily die if you didnt pay for any new guns. it doesnt matter if your on either side, both sides will team kill for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'n'giggles. its just bad... so bad 
4655	0	a	This game ran like absolute rubbish. And that is all I have to say.

4659	0	a	The Game dosent RUN ON MY COMPUTER BUT EVERY OTHER GAME DOES!!!!!!!!!
4660	0	a	A once promising game developed into a steaming pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by yet another company that has no idea what its doing with its product. Seems to be a pretty common theme these days, hence why I consider this the MMO dark ages. Simply no good games to play, just a bunch of could have been decent games that have already been run into the ground by incompetent developers and greedy companies.
4661	0	a	The Game is a concept thats pretty cool, but is executed poorly.  Pro's- -the game is Free. -Large map -Good Graphics Con's -Requires a beast of a pc to run properly -EVERYTHING is behind a pay wall -Unbalanced -IF you even buy some gun, you only keep it for 3 days -Map is lacking most detail -i found no use for in-game currency  Overall it's a 4.5/10 for me, I don't reccomend it, but you try this game, i's for 'free'
4662	0	a	While before I have gave this game a good rating, urging players to just give it a try. Well, that was back when the community was still pretty decent.   I base this review on my new experience, starting brand new character instead of playing as my old one.  Now, the community is just toxic. While I didn't notice any hacking of late, also did not get much time as people are quick to isolate and force out the 'noob', as I did not have easy access to good weapons when first starting. It is this kind of behavior that sickens me and will cause this games death as new players are instantly deterred and old players will simply stop playing.   Other than that, same as before, customization is in depth, still far beyond any other MMO I have tried. The driving mechanics feel like you are driving on ice though. And it is incredibly annoying, popping up my browser to open the store every time i switch districts.  I would not reccomend this to anyone anymore, which is tragic as me and my friends used to have a blast. Sorry, APB, it is time to move on.
4663	0	a	Oh this game had potential...  After several times of trying to play this, I've come to the conclusion that this game, along with the devs, are just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The game is a joke of what it USED TO BE, and even then it was a joke of what it could be! Yeah you can customize, if you could actually play it and win missions. Yeah it looks good, but that's because it was filmed with godmode turned on and an aimbot used. The controls: Pathetic. To drive, your either accelerating, or idling. Turning a car is like trying to ride a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ without paying her. If you want some piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to play, come play this! If you want a game that is cops v robbers, go play GTA, if you want customization, go play Sims or SPORE, but please for the love of the gods, leave this game where it is: In digital hell.

4668	0	a	By far the worst game 'on the market'. It has easily crumbled to ruins after what the current leaders have done to this game. They let it die and they ruined so much behind it. It used to be a fun, great, addicting game. But now it's a struggle just to even attempt to play the game. The issues that are presented are overwhelmingly frustrating. Let's talk about these flaws.  The connection issues that arose as of late making the game unbearable. The server has some serious kind of issues where the game freezes, your ping spikes up anywhere from 1-200 at this exact moment, your FPS drops up to 50% or more, and you start teleporting or 'rubber banding'. I have never, never in my entire life as a gamer, played an online game that had connections issues this bad. These spikes occur a few times throughout the minute, ranging from a couple to maybe 10 or even more.  Next, we get into the development of the game and who's behind it. Basically, the development is non-existant. This game has barley changed over the course of years. The original developers that had heart and care to make this game great and work on have been gone for quite a long time. We are presented with MEDIOCRE updates time and time again. The only updates that do come out take much too long and bring content that is meaningless. The big picture of this game is a complete failure. A new engine upgrade has been in the works for what, close to two years? Where is that development? We get pictures and false promises. False promises is all that this game is made of. The dev team is quite pathetic no matter what the size. I know teenagers that would do a better job with their amateur development skills in less than 3/4 of the then that of APB devs. And those devs that did stay up until recently are leaving to pursue better things.  There is simply no creativity left. There is nothing left. The game has no quality, it isn't fun to play. It's dying and it's been dying.  In game there are so many issues, so many things that need tweaking. The updates that we do get are horrible and frowned upon by the community time and time again. Lots of aspects in the game that are flawed, don't make sense. Bugs, glitches, stuff that has been here for YEARS completely ignored. Lots of cries that were never heard or reached out to. This is negligence at it's finest. The player never had a say in anything.  They attempted to merge the districts together in order to 'better' matchmaking and open more opportunities. However this was the start of all of the connection issues and the real death of this game. Even with the merge, the servers are very much dead. They have less players than the servers had alone before the merge.  This alone paints the picture of how this game has been going downhill.  Time and time again they neglect their fans that have been loyal all this time. And we get nothing at all in return. Customer support has forever been non existant and they really won't care to help you no matter what kind of issues you have. I have been faced with this multiple times. Gamersfirst staff only care about pushing more sales and more 'joker mystery boxes' because they think this is where the appeal lies. They only ever cared about the money. And nothing else. We are all bent over with our knee-pads on and sodomized terribly to this company.  Tiggs was the worst thing that ever happened to this game. I was never even slightly fond of her. She is just a muppet and her personality, tactics, and loyalties are a disgrace to the game. Why, out of all people, her? Just take a good look at this person and realize that she was a mistake.  Today stands the day where I lost everything I had for this game. There was a time I was so addicted I left my life behind for this game. A time where I considered this the best game of all time for how unique and creative it was, different for the time. It was that fun and addicting. However that is no longer. And if I were to rate this game today as it stands, I would give it maybe a 2.5/10. I even think the worst multiplayer game of all time (Infestation Survivor Stories) puts this game to shame.  I honestly hope that this game dies very soon or gets a major overhaul with a complete new owner and staff. But that won't. Once this game dies it will be taken into private hands and modded by fans that will make the game great again.
4669	0	a	APB RELOADED Horrible Community. Useless Game Designers(since beta network issues) nothing more. NO. Uninstall. Shut Down Get rid Of.
4670	0	a	It's a pay 2 win 0/10  good guns 7/10 nice cars 5/10 over all 0/10  Always get matchmake against a p2w and its not cool
4671	0	a	I spent some hefty time with this game, even before it was on steam. It was bad before, and now, worse. I just installed it again today and tried 3 matches. All 3, all Premium vs Non-premium. The animations are still choppy, awkward, with no improvement. Graphic overall, still unpolished as it was 2 years old. The only reason I can possibly think of for one to spend time in this game is for its customization system, but that thing is soo restricted for non-premium (like ridiculously resticted). This is a perfect example of a failed Free to Play model. Don't play this unless you're willing to invest alot of real money, otherwise, you will not have a good time against premium players with all their boons.
4672	0	a	Used to be a good game since I had nothing else to do. Now that I have Csgo, this is utter BS. Dont play this. It is basically a game where people who pay for their guns will always win. Spend a little money and actually get a good game you will like rather than play these free games.
4673	0	a	Pay2Win Galore.
4674	0	a	The game is good, but it is buy to win so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it...
4675	0	a	Pay to win

4677	0	a	this game made my brain wrecked
4678	0	a	this game is a virus it wont shut off!!! 
4679	0	a	THIS GAME used to be good i havent spent a single cent on it it used to be good....... But there is also one thing holding me back from this game is that there are no australian servers...... Turning and killing people is SO delayed over here i literaly have to press the turning button 3 seconds in advance for it to even turn and the deaths are so delayed its not funny. Gamersfirst if your reading this PLEASE make an australia server or an oceanic server alot of aussies will play this game if you had that.
4680	0	a	Has the worst matchmaking i've ever seen
4681	0	a	The game looks cool just that I can't play the game it just crashes 
4682	0	a	i didnt like it, messed up my fkin graphics drivers
4683	0	a	This was a fun game, but the devs don't really care about the players. If you play legitly and get banned, oh well. They won't help you. This game had a lot going for it, but due to the devs and the community, this game is not worth getting, even though it is free to play, which really means free to grind for hours on end for something you can just buy for a few dollars. The trailers also falsely lead you to believe that you can shoot anyone and take on any player at any given moment, which is not true. You have to be in a mission of some sort to have any pvp of any sort, and there is no pve at all.  Verdict: Not worth your time. If you want to play a game like this, Grand Theft Auto V has a better community, a better development team, and overall is just more fun thatn this.
4684	0	a	Great Game. One of the game that has held my attention the most. Played it for 2 years...  But, When that is said.. It has also been the most expensive game ever. And its a FreeToPlay!   The game offers a wide varity of guns, advantages, clothing and bodykits for cars = If u got the money.  I would understand if Premium was the only cost ingame. But taking money for 60% of ingame features is just wrong.  The itself is great, but the community is rude and lacks co op, The game is full of hackers, And its a Pay2Win game.   Not just Pay2Win, but Pay2Havefun...   GamerFirst really destroyed a great game.
4685	0	a	LOTS OF SCAMMERS. 0/10 would never play APB again
4686	0	a	(Refer to my profile picture)
4687	0	a	it's quite fun but...   its kinda pay to win~
4688	0	a	I really like the customization,but it's too PayToWin. You can't just spend 100$ on a game.
4689	0	a	this game is just a game, not intersting game, just a game.. not a good game. just a game.. just a game..  there are better games, this game is just a game
4690	0	a	Edit: Basically take all my negative aspects of this review and amplify them and you have an up to date review...  APB: Reloaded is a online 'Cops-and-Robbers' third person shooter game. Gameplay revolves around joining one of two factions, the Criminals or the Enforcers, and then competing in open-world objective-driven missions throughout various districts in the fictional city of San Paro.  Gameplay: The core gameplay of APB is what drives it. It takes an old classic concept (Cops vs. bad guys) and puts a whole new spin on it. Customization of your character is incredibly vast. You can personalize your character's appearance, vehicle, 'theme song,' graffiti logo, and weapon (to an extent.) The physics in the game are a bit exaggerated which often lead to funny, if not frustrating moments. Combat can be fun if you know what you're doing or are playing with people at your skill level.   In that regard, APB does have a match-making system that's good at generally picking out who's a newbie (bronze level) and who's a pro (gold level), but once you get down into it the game just pushes silver players and gold players together which can be frustrating if the game misinterprets whether the player is actually ready to be in that bracket. FINALLY, and this is important. The game does have pretty shameless elements of P2W (Pay 2 Win.) There are weapons that can only be obtained through purchase with actual money and do provide a decent advantage over players who don't pay anything.  Visuals: Graphics hold up decently to more modern titles. While there's certainly no comparison to the next-gen iteration of Grand Theft Auto V, APB took a smart route by utilizing a more cartoon-y look. It's not a photo-copy of reality, but it's not trying to be. That said, it still looks quite good.  Community: This is something that needs to be said about this game. The community is, by-and-large, not the friendliest group of people on the planet. This is partly to be expected from the players of a game where crime, and stopping it by whatever means necessary, is the name of the game. However, I'm not sure I know of a game with more trash-talking and general inconsideration this side of Call of Duty. Asking for help will either get you scoffed at, or given just enough help to get by, and THEN scoffed at. If you want to play with a group of people who aren't ego-maniacs or raging craphats, disable District Chat and invite your friends to play the game with you.  Overall: Don't get me wrong, this game was a big part of my downtime during Spring Break. When trolls and tryhards aren't gunning you down continually with overpowered P2W weapons, this game is a ton of fun. Occasionally you'll find a match that actually accomodates your skill and everyone will be in the same boat as you, and you'll have a blast. Practice and you'll sometimes find yourself top of the scoreboard for a match or two. Just don't take it too seriously, it is afterall just a game. But if you're someone who prone to raging at video games to the point of breaking things, you might need to look elsewhere.
4691	0	a	Used to be alright, now it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4692	0	a	Just a load of horse â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4693	0	a	I played this a while ago and I can't really remember it so it was probably not that good

4695	0	a	Literally aids
4696	0	a	I have taken â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ better than this.
4697	0	a	When this game was first released in stores and offered all content available to it's users, I heard nothing but great things about the game. Only downside was a smaller playerbase since many people simply have backed away from monthly payments for MMOs in the modern age of F2P (Free 2 Pay) games.  So eventually the game went F2P and moved onto Steam where I myself started playing it. Now it had a few bumpy issues such as having %30-%50 of the customization content blocked behind paywalls. But this was to be expected of a F2P game anyways.  Then the game slowly started changing...getting...corrupted...everything started costing money...the fun started to disappear as content was getting added slower...and slower...until the game was no longer the fun and customizable world that it promised to it's players. Now it is but a shell of itself, whispering...'pay me...paaaaay...meeee' in your ear at every opportunity.  10/10 wouldn't play again...
4698	0	a	Can't even play the game until I leave a Like on their facebook page?! Are you kidding me? Firstly how am I supposed to know if I like your game unless you let me play it first and secondly are you so insecure about it that you have to beg for likes before you let people see it? Uninstalled, pathetic.
4699	0	a	One of the worst games ive ever played
4700	0	a	Just can't get into it for some reason.
4701	0	a	THE WHORSE GAME I EVER PLAY HAHAAHAH BUILSHIT
4702	0	a	Dont Get me wrong the Game is funn but theres some game changing bugs such as if someone is close enough to the wall the can shoot you through it killing you. another thing theres only one server For NA(North America) and theres way to admins that abuse i was kicked about 12 times in the middle of gameplay i enjoyed playing for a bit but the admins really didnt allow me to play its worth downloading if you Are able to play without getting kicked. good luck dont download this game if you dont have the patients
4703	0	a	i liked how this game looked and all and the cars were awesome its really like GTA exept its glitchy as fk like sometime u cant see yack caus of dat glitch and gawd dam the lag is real here i got me a nice 64bit pc and its fast as fk but i cant really play this game to its full potential but hey if u got some crazy fast pc then u can play is with ease
4704	0	a	This game was once a great creation with loads of potential.  While still an addicting game that i feel has mastered the art of virtual 'cops and robbers' gameplay, it is sadly neglected all too often by the very company that is failing to keep it under their control.  The game is very poorly optimized, leaving it laggy at times to the point of complete unplayability, reguardless of how powerful your computer is. The amount of cheaters/hackers that roam is more than alarming and quite possibly the most i have ever seen in any game i have ever played.  The fact it is free to play also means that any cheater that is caught and banned can just make a new account, rejoin, and be back to cheating again in less than 5 minutes. The fact players know this leads to an ever growing population of cheaters. There needs to be a better form of anti cheat which not only bans a cheater/hacker but also prevents them from returning.   The gameplay within itself, however, is a lot of fun, mastering each gun is a unique challenge in its own.  Playing with friends can lead to tears of laughter, as long as you dont take it all too seriously anyways.  The character customization possibilities are endless and probably my favorite part about this game, theres just an infinite number of ways you can customize your character.  Servers are constantly getting ddosed by hackers anymore and G1 appears to care very little about anything at all except for farming money of their, more often than not, armas products. Gamersfirst? more like Moneyfirst. They feed the community lies and broken promises so often its a wonder how the company is even still running at all.  This game is AIDS, plain and simple. STAY AWAY!!!
4705	0	a	APB, Back in The Days Of. RealTime, They Had Some Problems With This Game Of Course, But, They Eventually Caught Up With Them Faster Then Most Companies Would, It Was Pretty Much A Dream Game You Just Got Hooked To In A Flash After Testing, After Getting The Ropes Untangled. Then They Died Out And Others Toke Over The Fantastic Game.  ... ThatÂ´s Were All Kinds Of Hell Broke Losse For ME At Least.  RealTime, Never Caught Up To ALL Of The Problems It Had, But, Who Cared Back Then When You Actually Had A Super Fun Game?!  This Was A, Great Game Once, And Will Sadly Never Be Again, As ItÂ´s Riddled With;  * Bugs. * Glitches. * Screwed Up Mission System. * Grindy Then EVER. * Screwed Up, Improvised, Match-Making-Atempt-of-A-System. * Login Errors. * Random Game-System Errors, Never Seen So MANY Different Error Codes Before.  And Feels UnFinished, WhatÂ´s Worrse IS The Use Of PunkBuster, Wich is An Early Warning Flag For These Types Of Games.  However. If You Want To Experiance A Fun, And Totally Epic Game IÂ´m Sad To Say: ' YOU WILL FIND IT!  And Then Crushed When You Realise, YouÂ´r Peared Up Against Someone With 1000+ Hours Of Game Play, And HE CHEATS, Abuses Bugs/Glitches.  When You First Join Up With A Crew (Clan), Rebels Or Enforcers, You Will Get To Learn By Your Mates, HOW YOU ABUSE THOSE BUGS/GLITCHES, This Is A Very Common Practise.  Others, Kick Crew Members Who Are Caught Using Those Underhanded Tactics, At Least There Is Some Sort Of Silver Lining?.......  I Do Not Recommend This Game Anymore For What Ever Reason, It Had ItÂ´s Prime Days,Now They Are Simply Gone. IÂ´d Say Take Care APB &amp; Rest In Peace.... ~ Cries *
4706	0	a	4 years ago I wrote a review regarding this title and as those 4 years have come and gone I hold a different opinion on this game. APB: Reloaded is a cops and robbers shoot em' up featuring loads of customization from tattoos, cars, guns, music, and of course your character. Now on paper it sounds like a solid idea and I will say it is but I have a few gripes. Like and other lesser know F2P title this game relies on micro-transactions (not forced thankfully) that are a little stupid. You want to own a gun perminately well throw some G1C down (in game currency) and your all set. Besides that matchmaking is more barren than a woman in her 70s I will sometimes by luck find a district full of 7 people or a measely 2 which is not exciting at all. All though im torn with the idea I can't recommend this game to really anyone sorry APB.
4707	0	a	Couldn't even get the game to start on Steam. Downloaded it off the official website and it took, like, 15 minutes after clicking start to actual boot up the game. Once I got it going it was nothing but laggy, even when I dropped the quality to the lowest it would go it. Not worth the effort.
4708	0	a	this game went â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, seriously.. the community sucks so hard, it could easily suck you through a garden hose. besides that, the publishers tend to scam us by any means necessary. i'm not even gonna talk about the massively increasing amount of cheaters wandering about, ruining your day.
4709	0	a	couldn't even play the game becasue it would never recognize my account and I know I put the password and username in right
4710	0	a	Stay far away from this horrible piece of garbage! It doesn't even start up anymore, and it takes a freaking century to start up because of the toxic waste known as its launcher. I've never seen such a waste of time!
4711	0	a	I played this a while ago and I can't really remember it so it was probably not that good

4720	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game...they say : ' Apb Reloaded need at least 2gb of ram and 4 gb recomanded ' i gave 2 gb ram..and i can run it ... ok ... :/
4721	0	a	Gets boring after a while... You have to work for a quite a long time to achive what you wanna have. The only thing I like is that you can really put a lot into making your characters. Kinda like The Sims 4 at that point, but poorer.
4722	0	a	Hello Guys, I've played this game for years starting in 2010 with some friends and I have played around 2000+ hrs on my account and 60 something hours via steam, But the reason I'm writing this review is to give advice to the next Innocent person walking into this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hole of game. Firstly the game is a love hate relationship you either like it or hate it not to mention also customization is brilliant but here comes the negative aspects.  Apb is a free to play mmo cops and robbers themed game, With free to plays you expect microtransactions well there is but the problem is they milk people for money, without considering what people actually want. For example people want the engine update or fix's for annoying bugs, but instead of good updates which make people more happy they slap a armas gun on the market place claiming it to be something magnificent, but it is only a reskin of another weapon in game.   Another reason why this game is bad is because of it's own community, the people in the community are absolutely cancerous and only strive to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you off or make your day worse, Not saying everyone is cancerous because I've have spoke to quite a few nice people it's just the majority. Not to mention there are quite a few unbalanced weapons, like before I used to think 'Well that guy is Just better than me' Which in most cases it was; but if you put a unbalanced weapon in the hands of a good player or even a bad one they can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your entire match up.   After all of that Negative â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I'll come down to saying this I'm giving a Warning to all players or people thinking of Playing this game. This game can cause you stress like nothing else and if you have anything like epilepsy or some sort PTSD stay away because it will cause you so much stress and make you soo â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that you're either going to have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing seizure or just freak the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out. Last thing I will say just to give you another reason to not play is gamersfirst make tons of promises which never happen.  Out of 1-10 It's a 4/10  Thus that makes the end of my Extremely Negative review and if any of you are interested I'm selling 4 of legendarys on Jericho (NA) add Ryoukomatoii and PM me or leave a message in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ review. Legendaries, Grenade launcher which shoots Concs, Nano, Ntec 7 Ursus and Hitchhiker I believe. I'll take real money these Will be going at a cheap price
4723	0	a	APB Reloaded is pretty much deviant art packaged into a .exe. I feel tremendous pain for those who have paid money on this incarnation of this game, which feels like a time capsule as there has still been no meaningful addition to what it offers players even after years of 'development'.  I made a Harlem Globetrotter though so I shall rate this game a 8/10.
4724	0	a	Hackers everywhere, just don't spend a single dime on this game.
4725	0	a	I loved this game at one time but I got banned for no reason that they were willing to explain to me and as such had to start from scratch on a new account, what the hell guys?
4726	0	a	It was fun. I would recommend it if it wasnt P2W now. Sadly they ****ed up this game. It was a great game tho !
4727	0	a	i might change my mind when i finally get it working. but for now it has been only annoying.
4728	0	a	Did not understand one thing about this game.Tutorial awful and cops keep killing new people that need help
4729	0	a	Doesn't even work. Says i have to verify my account, after i verify, it still says i have to verify. So i verify again, it says i still have to verify. So i verify... 
4730	0	a	I feel this game is rather unbalanced atmost.
4731	0	a	if you play have fun going to lag hell , dont recommend
4732	0	a	I may have clocked at least 195 hrs but heres my experience. I did get really far up only to rank 95 but I stopped playing as the rankings are unbalanced. You got gold threats trying getting into Slivers district to throw off the matchmaking and you got Slivers in Bronzes. The community is cancerous as players would call you 'noob', 'hacker', something around those lines. The lag is horrible, devs just pump more updates to take our money and don't actually do good contribution into the game. It's best you avoid this game unless you can actually handle it.
4733	0	a	DON'T GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THESE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ERS  played this without spending a dime and even then the gameplay was sub-par with most third person free roam games... yeah it's free but the UI is crap and the lag is unjustifiable for a game without demanding graphics... not to mention the kind of ping type lag i was getting into servers when i have decent internet.   apart from this there have been numerous stories of people spending hundreds of dollars only to have their accounts shut down out of the blue losing all their money.   Good luck trying to appeal that ban with such a horrible customer support service.   0/10 don't do it.
4734	0	a	this game does not work any more so do not down lad this games please.
4735	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ONE OF THE WORST GAME EVER.  I JUST CANT PLAY THIS. BECUZ SERVER IS BLOW ALL THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING TIME
4736	0	a	A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ version of gta online  not worth your time  or your money
4737	0	a	terrible game not worth even for free
4738	0	a	There is no such thing as headshots on this game. Shoot a guy in the head with a sniper and he will laugh and kill you with an automatic rifle while you reload. It seems like every window on the cars are bulletproof. The physics of this game are so messed up.   There is rarely any PvE which is fine. All your missions will be done against the opposition. This makes it hard for a beginner to get sold into the game especially when you have all the seasoned players crowding the newbie district. The tutorial is poor and doesn't explain some of the important mechanics like how to aim-outside-the-window of your buddy's car while he is driving. The elitist get mad when you don't play the game how they want you to play it. Its like they have their own little code of conduct.   I was looking for a clone to replace GTA but I guess I would rather play GTA instead. If you are expecting this game to be an alternative to GTA then you will be disappointed. The only thing this game has going for it is the customization(character, music playlist, guns, cars, and etc). Other than that, the game will make you mad and wish it would improve. Game has potential but the mechanics just are not fit for me.
4739	0	a	Great Game. One of the game that has held my attention the most. Played it for 2 years...  But, When that is said.. It has also been the most expensive game ever. And its a FreeToPlay!   The game offers a wide varity of guns, advantages, clothing and bodykits for cars = If u got the money.  I would understand if Premium was the only cost ingame. But taking money for 60% of ingame features is just wrong.  The itself is great, but the community is rude and lacks co op, The game is full of hackers, And its a Pay2Win game.   Not just Pay2Win, but Pay2Havefun...   GamerFirst really destroyed a great game.
4740	0	a	Pay2play soooooo much... Game - 0 $ ALL DLC - 123,97$
4741	0	a	Tis game is good if you want to smash your PC against a wall. It is full of pay-to-win players and is not fun unless you pay to win.Matchmaking is trash and the players are bad. DONT GET THIS GAME
4742	0	a	it's quite fun but...   its kinda pay to win~
4743	0	a	I really like the customization,but it's too PayToWin. You can't just spend 100$ on a game.
4744	0	a	I like this game but... when i open it. it crashes
4745	0	a	optimized like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, boring and unfriendly to new players, half of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is locked behind paywalls and the other half will take you 3 weeks straight of the same boring â™¥â™¥â™¥ PVP to get 
4746	0	a	APB Was A Fun Game Until Getting Into The Salty Horrifying Community... Just dont get the game.
4747	0	a	this game is just a game, not intersting game, just a game.. not a good game. just a game.. just a game..  there are better games, this game is just a game
4748	0	a	region locked in brazil, meh ps: this game is pay2win af, don`t even install
4749	0	a	Gameplay is not smooth at all, and it is unoriginal. Well, atleast I did not loose any money, time, or my soul to this game
4750	0	a	This honestly has to be the most nonsensical game Ive ever played. The gun damage makes 0 sense whatsoever. You hit a guy with an AK 15 times and he survives, and he shoots you 3 times with a pistol and you die. Whoever is defending is guaranteed to win every mission. I havent won a single mission where Im not defending, and havent lost a single mission where I am. This games 'skill' is purchased in the form of better equipment, that you cant buy until youre a high level. #hide2win
4751	0	a	doesnt even launch just takes you to a facebook page   EDIT: managed to get past the facebook page issue it launched closed itself out after about a minute then locked up my steam and i cant get rid of it i have no options but to restart my computer to be able to play any real games and delete this piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so in end if you want to break steam download this game and have fun breaking steam i sure as hell didnt
4752	0	a	Game was awesome, too bad it WAS... That was one of the best 3rd person shooter I have ever played, too bad this game is stucked at beta and its release date - 2011y... I have more than 12000h play off steam, max ranked, having collection of most legendary weapons, I havent payed a single cent for modifications, and im actually feeling good that i didnt putted any of my money into this game, gonna give some reasons... 1st things new players has to know - game is total P2W... If you are not going to pay money on this thing - you will regret starting playing this thing... If you are player that has bigger rank than 100 and you get gold, you gonna get f*cked up by c*nts that either cheat or are P2W, having all the weapons bought from G1M... 2nd thing would be stucking in 2011 year, in whole my huge gameplay experience i had only 1 patch, that added some new weapons, vehicles and some modifications in the game (Yes, Im talking about rising max rank until 255R and adding 2 new characters)... 3rd thing - they started nerfing legendary old school weapons like sitting ducks and ect., making to spend even more money on new legendaries or G1M shop, I totally do not support any of these things... 4th would be server instability, game had great stability until community started asking new anti cheating systems, that totally destroyed stability, and havent helped a bit from cheaters. 5th - unreasonable banning just because some ppl complained that you hack, just because they are better than reporters, thats how i got my 1st account banned - without evidences and stupid reasons... 6th would be hilariously stupid matchmaking and balances - Gold guys are playing in silver servers, silvers play in bronze, and bronze dont have where to run from silvers, the other thing would be about golden players 7th - gold players... If you got gold in game - you can say goodbye to game, because gold is the place where P2W and hackers plays, if you get there, prepare for the worst... I stopped playing this game and dont play it for &gt;1 year now, because i realised G1 cares only the smell of fresh earned dirty money... I totally DO NOT RECOMMEND SPENDING A SINGLE BUCK ON THIS CRAP, SO DEVS WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOING TO LOSE ALL THE PLAYERS, AND I PERSONALLY HOPE IT WILL HAPPEN 1 DAY! Sorry if my review contain mistakes, nobody is perfect, but the game IS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION. -8/10
4753	0	a	Game wouldnt even start up for me.  
4754	0	a	DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!
4755	0	a	Was great years ago, now it's dead/ not worth the time
4756	0	a	So APB has had a rocky road. Real Time Worlds was the first company to develop and make APB. However, the game was plagued with issues. From talk of supposed ex employes, the game was rushed out for lack of funds. Some employees cam out and posted concept art and plans for what they wanted to do with the game but couldn't because lack of funds. It sounds amazing.  So you had this game come out and it was horrible. The optimization was in a horrid state. Griefing and hackers everywhere. Horrible progression system. Some horrible missions. General horrible map design. To top it off...it cost 15$ a month to play.  Needless to say, it failed. It went under. RTW went out of business (hence the in memorium at the start of the game). The game I think lasted like 2 months? G1st bought them up later in 2010.   Sadly...they've done nothing with it. Lets go over the major changes they've made to the game.  1. New Anti-hack system - this helped with the hackers, but there will always be hackers in the game. Its in a much better state, but as a f2p game...you know how it goes.   2. Fightclub - Essentially they took parts of the pre existing map, put up barriers around it, put it into its own instance, then threw 12v12 battles into it over certain objectives. Not really adding anything. Mainly just...re-arranging stuff.   3. Joker Tickets - a special currency from fight club. I will say that they did add in quite a few items to be used with joker tickets.  4. Cash Shop Introduction  5. Numerous cash shop guns  6. Numerous cash shop clothing  7. Numerous cash shop cars/kits  8. Festival events that often have a heavy cash shop undertone   9. New 'end game' NPC that sells new clothing/gear  10. New equipment/consumables  11. Performance fixes/bug fixes/optimization  12. Removal of 'bad' missions and poor designed missions  13. A 'better' matchmaking system  So over the past 6 years, those are the major things that have been accomplished. As you can see, they didn't really add anything into the game. The major things that can be considered additions are the cash shop related stuff, one NPC that is at the very end, better anti hacker, and their gear, and joker tickets gear. Fightclub wasn't really an addition since they're basically just copy and pasting pre-existing code and blocking off a section of a map that is already there. The asylum is a special fight club only map, but even that is rumored to not be made by g1st. Apparently it already existed in the game files but wasn't quite ready for released. I think it took them like 3-4 years to released it.   Now there are problems that existed in the game with RTW...that still exist.   1. Matchmaking. It's horrible. See there are two things in the game. You have a threat level and a rank level. Now I think the max rank is 255. Rank is required to use some gear and generally tells you how long a player has been playing. Imagine this being like levels in a standard MMORPG. Higher ranks have access to more gear, equipment, upgrades, cars, etc. Threat level tells you how 'good' you are. You go from trainie, green, bronze, silver, gold. It's insanely easy to get gold if you're even moderately good. So how does the MM work? It only takes into account threat level. So I've been in situations where you have a rank 50-110 with low level gear going up against a highly geared 255 rank in gold districts. Heck, even silver districts have this issue. It doesn't end there.  Now this game has districts. Districts are split by threat level. Gold can join gold and silver districts. Silver can join (I think) gold, silver, and bronze. Bronze can join silver, bronze, and green. A gold can't join a bronze district for example. What people do is intentionally lose games to lower their threat level to join lower districts. I just had a fight where you me and one other silver and a traine going up against two rank 150+ gold players in a bronze district.    http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/391733-matchmaking-at-its-best/   That's a good indicator at how bad the MM is at its current state. Even with their attempts to fix it.   2. Horrible Map Design. They never really tried to fix some of the map issues. In terms of a shooter, it's still bad. Full of choke points, campable areas, and just general frustration. There are freeways in the game and they're what they sound like...big open freeways. People love to get snipers and sit on them because they're insanely hard to take out since you have to find a ramp and hope you can make it to the sniper before he shoots you as you drive across a big open area.   3. Edge of p2w. Right now the game is basically 'pay money for good gear now'. Most of the guns/weapons you can get in game. Personally I consider 'pay real money now or spend 30+ hours working towards the same gun' to be p2w.   4. Progression is slow. You need to progress roles and contacts to get certain gear. Some gear like upgrades require you to use a weapon to unlock upgrades for it. So if you want to get a certain upgrade for your assault rifle, you've got to use your assault rifle a ton. So if you're in a gold district there's a chance you'll be fighting highly customized weapons with a unmodded weapon. It's very frustrating.  5. Horrible Mission Design. So the only thing they touched with the mission system is taking out missions. Sadly, they can't take them out (that would mean they have to make more). There are still horrible ones. Two off the top of my head. One is called VIP. A player on one team is selected to be VIP and everyone in the game can see the big VIP marker from anywhere on the map. Through walls, etc. Basically taking out any sort of stealth strategy for one team. The VIP has a set amount of lives and the attacking team has a set amount of lives. Putting the entire games success on the hands of one individual that may or may not be horrible (and is handicapped with a 'wallhack' so to speak) is very frustating. I hate being the VIP. It's not fun. Another one is where each team gets a big marker above the head of each member and a set amount of lives for the team. Basically a TDM. Again, no stealth. The amount of times I've seen people standing behind walls looking at one another with third person view waiting for the other to move is a ton. Or they all go to some insanely easy campable area only counterable with a nade launcher (which is like an endgame, last unlocked weapon). Or worse, they get enough kills to be considered 'winning' and then they run around the map running the clock.   6. Optimzation issues. Still huge FPS drops randomly. I think it has something to do with the gun smoke. I can run Gw2, GTA V, planetside 2, elite dangerous, etc etc. However, I still get horrible FPS drops in this game. Apparently they're making a new renderer which I hope will help the game. It's very frustrating to get into a firefight and have your FPS Drop to like 2-5 randomly in the middle of it.   7. Spawning. Spawning in both Fightclub and the vanilla mode is horrible. For example on the VIP thing. The amount of times I've been spawned in road right in the sights of an enemy sniper is a lot. Or wayyy far away from any team members and closer to enemies. Today I was playing fightclub capturing a point and TWO enemies spawned next to the point and killed me. So lame.   The major reason that this game is pulling the numbers it does (peaks at around 2300 right now) is because there's no other game like it. GTA V did put a dent in the population. APB averaged around 2100 players the same month as GTA V release and some months before that. After it released it has been dropping till what it is now...averaging 1400 player. If they actually did something with this game in the 6 years they've owned it, I'd recommend it. Right now it seems like they're putting forth minimal effot to keep it alive and makin money. Maybe they've spent all this time prepping it for console release
4757	0	a	Pay to win. Takes forever to advance if you dont spend money.
4758	0	a	ugggghhh if you dont wanna pay to win its really not worth playing this laggy game
4759	0	a	Pay 2 win game, better save the money and buy GTA V.
4760	0	a	Just a load of horse â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4761	0	a	its like a horrible version of GTA SA ONLINE.
4762	0	a	Was tempted to play the game after watching some gameplay. The only thing in the beginning that had me a little uninterested was the fact that there were people running around in weaboo outfits but that's just a small personal issue. After playing it with a friend for a few hours it was pretty clear that grenades were a fan favorite. Didn't have fun at all, we were going against players who were 'Max Prestige' I never cared to look at how the leveling works but that seems to be pretty damn high. First review I have done on a game and my butt hurts so much from this weaboo-grenade mess of a game.
4763	0	a	Just a load of horse â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4764	0	a	Used to be alright, now it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4765	0	a	If you're thinking about tryin this game, I would not jump in at this point because the learning curve is a bit too steep to compete with the players who have been on for a while.
4766	0	a	I have taken â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ better than this.
4767	0	a	One of the worst games ive ever played
4768	0	a	Anyone know why i cannot join the game. Im from mongolia so i think its restricted or something. It said this acc is already on use or some error numbers. For the developers fix this thing if you create this game for people to play. Make things full pleasure. Not for money. For future technology of game.You can make money from this but not just for money. Remember this. for the review i give 4/10. Who have same problem and same feelings with me ??
4769	0	a	When this game was first released in stores and offered all content available to it's users, I heard nothing but great things about the game. Only downside was a smaller playerbase since many people simply have backed away from monthly payments for MMOs in the modern age of F2P (Free 2 Pay) games.  So eventually the game went F2P and moved onto Steam where I myself started playing it. Now it had a few bumpy issues such as having %30-%50 of the customization content blocked behind paywalls. But this was to be expected of a F2P game anyways.  Then the game slowly started changing...getting...corrupted...everything started costing money...the fun started to disappear as content was getting added slower...and slower...until the game was no longer the fun and customizable world that it promised to it's players. Now it is but a shell of itself, whispering...'pay me...paaaaay...meeee' in your ear at every opportunity.  10/10 wouldn't play again...
4770	0	a	Can't even play the game until I leave a Like on their facebook page?! Are you kidding me? Firstly how am I supposed to know if I like your game unless you let me play it first and secondly are you so insecure about it that you have to beg for likes before you let people see it? Uninstalled, pathetic.
4771	0	a	Dont Get me wrong the Game is funn but theres some game changing bugs such as if someone is close enough to the wall the can shoot you through it killing you. another thing theres only one server For NA(North America) and theres way to admins that abuse i was kicked about 12 times in the middle of gameplay i enjoyed playing for a bit but the admins really didnt allow me to play its worth downloading if you Are able to play without getting kicked. good luck dont download this game if you dont have the patients
4772	0	a	Free GTA online that gets worse and worse every time you play  I'm not joking
4773	0	a	This game is full of cheaters. RIP Do not waste 5 gig on this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
4774	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ass game don't work.
4775	0	a	This game wouldn't even start.
4776	0	a	On the store page it says free to play. This is the worst free to play game that i have ever played you cant experience everithing without using money there are some game that you need to grind in but this game tops all of them.i havent played much but if i play a game and i get frustrated from it in 1 hour then its a bad game in my opinnion,but give it a try you might like it.
4777	0	a	i used to love this game, but coming back to it now i see its just another grindy steaming pile of p2w garbage. the only way to actually beat any missions is either rent expensive better weapons (you cant actually keep the good ones as they expire) or hope the enemy team is too busy killing you to actually do the objectives. you can grind money for better gear but it takes forever with the tiny payouts, and theres always going to be that jackass with his parent's credit card running around with all the good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. importing music is just terrible as it usually auto-deletes any copyrighted song so i have to wonder why that feature is even there. the lag is horrid, makes it hardly playable. The game's clothes and vehicle customization is the best thing about it, but getting good looking stuff requires you to unlock and max out huge strings of npc experience, for basic items like shirts and masks, which wouldn't be bad if doing so wasn't tedious. decals are also limited unless you get the premium.  long story short; if your looking for a terrible, generic p2w game you found it.
4778	0	a	here's a better idea; how about you make your game actually worth playing and fun instead of a boring â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of the same recycled â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t missions over and over again?   also another tip; fix your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game, it runs like dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, even on high end PC's, what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do you expect out of a xbone version? to make it even more un-enjoyable? i gurante it won't even hit 30-20 fps.   this is why your game is dying,you know you're only doing this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to make more money, and to top it off, this really shows how little you give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about you're own game, because if you can release and port an xbone version of this garbage, then you can make a fully functional â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game.   â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, G1.
4779	0	a	Legit player who took there time and money to this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game get Fairâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed while obvious cheaters can cheat for 2-3 years and not get banned
4780	0	a	This game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mach making is horrible so it like one level 3 versus 5 level 200eds. Its very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and im resigning on this game for a long time. Hear that APB im calling â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t!
4781	0	a	Fails to load Constantly
4782	0	a	WTF IS THIS GAME ITS PAY TO WIN HARD TO SHOOT HARD TO DRIVE LIKE OMG THIS GAMWE IS SDHITTY I SUGGEST YOU DONT EVEN MOVE YOUR MOUSE NEAR THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ DOWNLOAD BUTTON IF YOU CLICK IT IT WILL DOWNLOAD A CANCER GAME 
4783	0	a	I dont like this game
4784	0	a	It's got no controller support, a bunch of high priced DLC, and is just a mess.  I know it's free, but when getting rated, free games don't get a pass just because they can installed, and uninstalled at will. They are games that need to be rated. They don't deserve a free pass.
4785	0	a	I remember playing this like 3 years ago. And when i did, the game was plain up boring. The reason is that the game is way too pay to win - a cliche that most free games use to get atleast some profit... and that profit is way too off top and just unfair.  Terrible and boring - that's my experience.
4786	0	a	A few years ago i was like: did you want to play GTA online.. but as a GOOD game not that shity boring GTA... here you go,    Updated version: Became pay so you can win while after a update you have to pay again to win.....
4787	0	a	A great game with amazing customization that is a way smoother, better GTA Online.  APB: Reloaded is a repetitive game that you never just kind of get bored of, since its never just killing each other, you will always be tasked to defend/attack/capture an objective. Every mission you play is different, each team will affect how the mission progresses, for example, if your team has anti vehicle weapons, and the enemy team has to deliver cars, you will have a way higher chance of winning that stage of the mission. Using the right type of guns in the right situation will greatly affect how the match progresses.  Missions with multiple players are always chaos, as players with rockets launchers and light-machine guns come after your â™¥â™¥â™¥, other players out of your mission hurry to their mission, and on their way, crash to your car causing your car to flip and forcing you to continue on foot. Many things can affect your mission in a positive or  negative way. San Paro is absolute CHAOS.  Pros and Cons  Pros: - A great Grand Theft Auto like PVP game - Amazing customization (cars, players, clothes, guns, symbols) - A very unique type of game that you HAVEN'T seen before. - Many ways to play the game - Free to play - Very smooth gameplay - Doesn't get boring after thousands of hours of gameplay - Very fun to play with friends (not as fun alone..)  Cons: - Armas Marketplace (You can buy ingame stuff with real money,  prizes are ridiculously high and they should rather be unlockable through ingame progression)   (THESE ARE HUGE ISSUES WITH THE GAME) --&gt;&gt;&gt; Poorly optimized (even players with high end computers lag alot) --&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Servers lag often (only thing they seem to do is reset the servers which does nothing)   - Devs are really slow at fixing the game's problems - Hackers (they now get banned fast though) - Bad community (unfriendly) - NHVR sniper needs to be nerfed, ridiculously overpowered  ##################################################################  In the end, after 2,990 hours, was it worth it?  No. Servers at the moment are garbage, game servers lag almost daily (ddos or other excuse they say), and fps is garbage in the game always since they do not optimize it, and servers are always running on migitation (means more lags, less ddos)  Would not recommend this game as the core idea is good but the game itself is a HUGE disappointment. I've had to spend a ton of money to enjoy the game to the fullest. And to a degree, I regret it.
4788	0	a	just â™¥â™¥â™¥ this thing
4789	0	a	Crashes to much as soon as I get in game  
4790	0	a	Great visuals, lovely sound system, and nice array of weapons. However, the controls are clunky, the cars slide like they're on ice, and the game is heavily stacked against criminals. you can't even keep any guns beyond the starters for more than 10 days. I give it 4/10
4791	0	a	Game used to be great in the past....used to play it ALL the time. I mean ALL THE TIME! But things have changed.. Back in the day you had to have actual skill and had to grind to get the most op of weapons and whatnot...these days you've got lvl 9's ( starting rank ) using an Orange weapon and then dominating the whole match with it....Then there is the Nano..the most overpowered weapon in the game and the sad part is low ranks use this to get Gold threat..oh and did I mention the OCA Whisper? Then you have the Developers...they don't give a damn about the game other than adding more P2W â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and then adding in 'Events' like kill these many people with a specific weapon and get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥....they add absolutely nothing new to the game ( like they used to back in 2013-2014 )... Just play it, buy an Orange weapon and BOOM! you're a pro with no skills...From me this is going to be a sad No due to the MAJOR P2W the game has got
4792	0	a	Terrible. Just terrible. From its suspicious anti-cheat engines running in the background to the 2005 graphics, this game makes my list for one of the most bland and boring games. Do not download it.  Pros:  -It's free.  Cons: -Horrible lowly community of people who seek therapists. -Pay to customize. -Graphics are terrible even on the highest settings. -Frames are always 15-20 fps on a desktop that has 12 gigabytes of RAM. -Feels like a GTA clone. -A world with little to do but kill others. -Strange lighting. -Very confusing to get the hang of missions and what you're even supposed to do. -Launcher always fails at least once before it is able to successfully launch. -Disorganized world. -The two factions feel very unorganized. -Causes me to vomit.
4793	0	a	Most broken game i have played!  performance is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, uses ages to load anything, have to use 48x AA to fully use the gpu, and you're stuck with 75 fps the pvp is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t as mission makes you face people with rpg's that instakill you or snipers while new players are stuck with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ assault rifles and a pistol with barely any damage.
4794	0	a	I used to love this game when I didn't have many games to play, but after going back to it I have noticed how glitchy and also how extremely pay 2 win this game is. Also, it'd be wrong to call this game 'GTA online' but it has a lot of potential and I did enjoy this game a lot playing till midnight with mates on Skype.   But to sum it up, the game simply has reached a dead end, the playerbase is basically dead and the gliches and P2W aspects are just stupid.
4795	0	a	This is by far the worst community I've experienced in twenty years of gaming. This game attracts the lowest common denominator of every other game. Beyond the community, it's barely functional and runs horribly even on great machines. The engine update was promised for Q1 2014, yet it still hasn't happened. It can be fun at times, and it is a great idea for a game. However, the execution is extremely poor. I would not recommend this one.
4796	0	a	Tutorial turns you away from this game.
4797	0	a	The worst optimization I've ever seen. (Maybe Saints Row 2 matches this game). It's ok when you walk but when you're driving, it's a nightmare... And also driving model is very uncomfortable.
4798	0	a	Dis game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !! If u want free doritos and free mountain dew , DONT . EVER . INSTALL . THIS . GAME . M8 !!!!
4799	0	a	If they could remake this game but making it good.. it would be soo â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ best game for some good years. But not how they fked it :3
4800	0	a	wont even let me get in pieace of **** cant b ****** u crapy game go suck a lolli u drible bum im tow â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for this **** buy
4801	0	a	This may have differed now, but when I played this game, the landscape was a barren wasteland with nobody in it. (Not literally a wasteland) Also, it was hard as hell to find things to do but roam around. Half the time you would just be getting shot by other players and they are way better than you, so you can't do anything about it. It is also a GTA Clone. And by Barren I meant there were no NPC's you could ever find 2.3/10 -Wasn't Very Fun
4802	0	a	The game will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you over.   You will play it.   And you will soon be trapped in it's loop.   You'll play it and then quit.   Suddenly three months go by like it was nothing.   You'll be stuck in this cycle.   You will play this game and then quit then back you go.   I'm installing the game as I type this.   The curse has come back to haunt me.   Please help me.
4803	0	a	60 mins of play time with my friend.   10 mins of trying to figger out how the char maker works 5 mins making the char  roughly 10 mins to try and figger the tutoral out.  nothing said how to get money. or that money was sitting in the mail it just said check mail not (your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is in the mail) than moved on to the next thing  finaly figger this out and get my stuff good to go after about the 25 min mark  me and my team mate get going. 2 mins out. we get killed by one dude we go out again. this time find nothing and no one to do anything. 10 mins later we are swarmed spend the 20 mins dieing and dieing and dieing thanks to spawn campers who in fairness may not have known they were spawn camping.   2 cops agesnt 15 criminals  when no other cops in the area were helping  why am i a cop?  
4804	0	a	This game needs a lot of improvements, it's laggy, combat is old, and it's dead, no players play anymore :D But this game is cool and can be improved, and full customization bring BIG UP :D but i can't recommend it until it will be improved, i'll change my review if it will be updated.
4805	0	a	So I wrote that section at the bottom way back in 2014, recommending the game. I've since changed my opinion.  Honestly, this game does have great potential, but it's wasted by empty promises for better updates and non-stop premium shop content releases.  A lot of weapons are simply not viable thanks to a small meta selection that out-performs the rest, and the developers aren't looking to balance things out any time soon.  Terrible match-making paired with terrible mission objective locations means you'll eaver be the team that stomps, or the team getting stomped. There's no close matches anymore, it's always a hard win or a hard loss.  Developers have repeatedly promised updates that will fix things, such as an engine update for optimisation, chat moderation systems and weapon balancing, and each time a deadline has been given, it's come to pass with nothing but a few new premium items added to the market.  If you want to try this game, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it, it's free after all. Just don't invest your money into it, at this point the game deserves to die.  __________________  It's undeniable that this game has a great, unique concept and is literally brimming with potential. Endless customization and plenty of things to do let you truly shape your own life in this non-linear game.   Hours, days and even weeks can be spent on this game without losing interest and entertainment.   Sadly its full potential is yet to be met by the developers who bought out this game, but recently hope has been lit as they detail changes they're working on.   I wholeheartedly recommended this game to everyone, despite it's flaws. The entertainment this game delivers is truly noteworthy for a free to play game.
4806	0	a	Worst third person shooter I've ever played. Hackers everywhere, never miss a shot and can see you coming on radar you don't have. Pointless to play even with money.
4807	0	a	Good Game but Gamersfirst are a bad company, dont waste your money
4808	0	a	looks like a great game to play with your mates, but it would not open/run for me and it was laggin my PC so i got rid of it pertty quick
4809	0	a	MoneyFirst GamersLast, game blows.. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ registry, servers blow
4810	0	a	Take a good idea, make the game.  Then add pay to win. And then add hackers. And then add toxic community. And then add annoying devs.  There you go, a pile of s***.  But really, this game had lots of potential, fun gameplay, character/vehicle customization, unique gamestyle, unique lore etc.  But G1, just wow, how did you ruin this game at all?  Pay to win : YES! Game is P2W. Compairing the best weapon bought with ingame cash with the one you pay for it. Result? The one you pay for it wrecks everything. Weapons are not cheap, both ingame and G1 store. You won't have a chance (maybe a little) against a guy with a paid weapon.  Hackers : They updated their anti-cheat program. Did it do any good? NO! Still fighting against â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hackers.  Toxic community : So, you killed someone? Get insulted. You got killed? Get insulted. Left the mission? Get insulted. Was driving around but someone crashed into you? Get insulted. You did nothing? Get insulted. Well, if you want to stay away from rich kids, do not, DO NOT play this game at all.  Annoying devs : Sent few tickets, never got a response or got a trolling one. They see themselves as gods, if you say anything that bothers them, BAM, you get banned.

4812	0	a	The developers should be ashamed of turning such a great game into the most notorious P2W garbage. They better upgrade the engine soon or I quit APB.
4813	0	a	I can't tell if I like this game or not because I seriously can't tell if I'm playing the game right or not. I've never played something that's kept me utterly confused six months after playing it.
4814	0	a	APB Reloaded for dummys 1 download the game 2 sign in 3 fail signing in 4 make an account 5 sign in again 6 fail signing in sign in 7 fail signing in 8 realise you needed to confirm your email 9 confirm your stupid email 10 sign in for the last friggin time! 11 finally it works... 12 create your character anticipating that it has the best creation system ever 13 start the game with a crappy character 14 game lags like friggin crazy!! 15 realize, it wasn't love at first sight 2/10
4815	0	a	Seriously, dont play this game. If you don't get kicked after five mins, for some stupid reason, there isn't even a storyline in this game. And there is no one playing anyways. Dont waste your time on this..
4816	0	a	  Its a fun game. But its pay to win. Which no one likes games like that.
4817	0	a	I download this game to find oh i try to login and nothing happens,i click play and is acts like its gonna play then the browser closes. THIS GAME IS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OF A WASTE OF TIME!!!
4818	0	a	Sadly I got banned from this game but I would recommend for customizations but not recommend due to the in balance in game play when people buy from the micro transaction
4819	0	a	I don't get what this game is about
4820	0	a	well it could have been a great game but the missions are repetive and it just feels clumsy  also there is the pay to win part.. the grind is horrible on free player and customization even is limited if you dont pay  i dont really know what to say about this game... but it's horrible...
4821	0	a	If this game wasnt P2W it would be so unbelievable GREAT. The coustomisation is unlike any other game. The idea is really something else aswell as captivating and competitive. If you only had to use real money to look cool or have a cool car it would be amasing. But this game is too unbalanced by the obtainable weapons with microtransactions that its hard to actually engoy it.
4822	0	a	This game was fun for a while, but quickly got boring. Along with that you've got the most cringe-worthy and toxic of communities, and you just end up with a hot mess that likes to charge you 40-bucks for Pay to Win guns, and overall it's just not worth the effort.  This was a game we all looked forward to and drooled over... but in the end it didn't live up to what it could have potentially offered. And honestly I think a lot of that had to do with gamersfirst being in charge of it. Quit a slimey company, especially if you read any of their official responses on their forums.
4823	0	a	The admins are clueless, the mods who are not employed with the company are ignorant, the cheaters have taken over the game, Deep Silver is ruining their game, the admins are nowhere to be seen, the only employee who appears to have any form of discussion with players is CM Tiggs, i never met her, even though when i was a GM/CM over at T3Entertainment, i heard she use to be a CM with HanbitSoft, even though I'm not sure if that was true or not. I have nothing against her personally, but she needs to do something with the forum mods and get rid of them.   Depsite the BS. I click no on recommend 'in general'&gt; But read below , because despite all the crap with this game, I'm not against anyone playing it. But listen good, DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS COMPANY MONEY. Everything i mention above , they don't deserve our money until they do something about the things which i mention. And until the cons below are fixed.   NOTE: IF ANYTHING IF YOU MUST , DO GIVE MONEY FOR PREMIUM, ITS THE ONLY THING WORTH BUYING. BECAUSE WITHOUT PREMIUM THE GAME IS POINTLESS TO PLAY. But read below about that.  Pros+ Intro Music  Character Customaztion Car Customzation Music in General Feature to add your own Custom Music Driving around  OCA Whipser is very nice gun to use.  Cons- The game itself Gameplay is boring Missions are repetitive Only 2 maps They removed the old threat system which made the game run, i told them once they removed it, it will runied the game and lose players . As you can see they didn't listen to me lol.  Game popluation is very low Downgraded graphics Cheaters/Hackers Everywhere Lame Anti-cheat method Lack of GM's Firing Good GM's Fight Club Mode is lazy, which means, instead of them designing new areas for FC, they took the main 2 maps and use some of that and made that into 2 Maps. Now that wouldn't be a bad thing, if they added new areas/maps every 6 months. But its the same 2 FC Maps for what 4 years now. Very very Toxic Community, never add friends you don't know IRL, never group with anyone, never trade with anyone.  No PVE Only PVP Macro users Closet Hackers Corrupt GM's( now ) Forum is toxic due to mods not being employed with the company. Tech Mech honestly should be fired becasue of this. He's letting people who are not even employed with the company run his forum. But wait, Where is Tech Mech? Nobody has seen or heard from him in months.  Asylum after 5 years still not completed The main 2 maps are still unfinished. Very poor performance Without premium game is pointless to play  ...................................................  Bottom line: If you choose to play this game, you will get bored. Its like GTA but done in a very poor way. David Jones the Creator should be glad he left. Do not give money to this game. And oh yea, there's suppose to be a engine upgrade coming out, but the staff never listens and due to some NDA ( Which i highly doubt is in place ) they can't show anything. But wait, they already show 3 videos and 15 pictures. But now they can't show anything lol. So play this game, but never give money to them, if you must though, find alt ways to earn premium, or if you must, only buy premium and nothing else and use the market to get things you want. The market in game.   Such a great game years ago. My advice, and i strongly suggest you do this for the best alt for APB:  Saints row 3 and 4 Hellgate London (which has even more customaztion compred to APB) Sleeping Dogs Crackdown 3, which is being worked on by RTW staff and Dave Jones himself.  NOTE: I have no inteintion on fully coming back to this game until i see what the engine upgrade is going to be like. If they didn't add blue tracers back, the old threat system or 'more importanlty' HQ Bloom, I'm never coming back.
4824	0	a	The game has hardly any objective, the servers have a population of around 2-10 people. Everything in the game is played for.  Basically its a pay to win game making it automatically crap  Dont get, dont waste your time.
4825	0	a	Never play this game... I've played it nearly since 2011 but the game is always sucks. So many hackers and owners of the game just cares about your wallet. Bad.
4826	0	a	The customization in the game is great, but that is really all i can say well about it..
4827	0	a	It takes years to load up the game fix it please!

4834	0	a	Less fun more frustrating. I bought this back in 2010 like an idiot just before the original creators went bust, and the new owners G1 have added nothing of value in the 6 years they have been running it
4835	0	a	Dont waste your time playing this game
4836	0	a	If you want to rage quit download this game, if not go find another game.
4837	0	a	Alright game but most of this is pay to win.
4838	0	a	love the game but all the hacks in this game, it's just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. and it sucks how there are no npcs to even fight either. it's strict always pvp fighting but I'd love there to be PvE fighting in the game also.
4839	0	a	Gets boring real easily. Customizations to your character and vehicles are extremely expensive, and you get killed a lot!
4840	0	a	Its like Mexican Candy (No offence to Mexicans just a Joke) It Looks good but really Its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Worth your Time? Dont! you know the awncer, its like Going to the mexican store and getting the candy you are clearly gonna throw away is more worth your time.
4841	0	a	Sadly I have to change my good review into a bad one. Once I defended this game, now I have to agree with every single person who says 'APB is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!' it is impossible to defend this anymore.  So to add a little context here, I started APB on christmas of 2011 having just upgraded my PC, and I loved it. I would roll with friends taking down crims and enjoying the great sort of arcade feel to the combat and overall play of the game. I took breaks every now and again but I started to play more and more, sometimes playing nothing but APB all day. Come 2014 and I started to see and feel the problems with this game, the player base was dropping, more glitches were arising, stupid balance changes making some weapons boring or bad to use and no new content was being released.  2 years later here I am, trying to find a similar game to APB (in terms of how it plays) to replace it because APB is just not fun anymore. I still hop on it for a short time occasionally but that is mostly filled with frustration rather than fun. APB is a prime example of what happens to games when there are no other games to compete against. APB is pretty much a one of a kind, so the devs can get away with being idiots and people will still play.  By all means, try APB is you want, but do not expect much out of it.  TL;DR: APB used to be a fantastic game, now the devs have made it not fun.
4842	0	a	This game is unique and addictive. It's like GTA, just that it has smaller maps. The gameplay is a lot batter and the customization is epic. Back when it came out i would recommend this game, but not anymore. I am not saying that all the things GamersFirst did were bad, but a lot of them were. Now let's go to the sad part. It has unbalanced missions and weapons, bad spawns, matchmaking, community and it contains lot's of bugs, that are not getting fixed. Marketplace is too expensive, the servers are unstable and are sometimes being ddosed. When that happens the ms jumps over 150, makes it unplayable. They are not adding any new stuff to the game that they promised long ago (like new contacts, free content) nor are they listening to community wishes. The engine upgrade has been in making for eva and they keep postponing the date of its release!  The game has been in a really bad shape for a long time and considering what have we the community seen so far, there is no chance it will get any better anytime soon, maybe never who knows....
4843	0	a	Was a decent game at one point in time, now is full on Pay To Win and everyone is Level 100+. Also Controls feel like crap, wasn't too bad when the game was fun but now it's very noticeable.

4850	0	a	One of the best games ever. Don't get swayed by the pictures though. Almost if not everything on them has to be paid with real money in order to be used, and nothing is actually that cheap. The game has serious flaws that need to be fixed ASAP, but are there for a long time now. The game has potential, but the company behind it is too slow to make it a game worth paying on the long run.
4851	0	a	awefull balance on top of P2W and cancerous community.  Amazing character creation system, spoiled by the terrible actual gunfights where if you dont submitt to the meta of the game (tank LMG, or clotting SMGs/shotguns/RPGs.) then you will always be at a disadvantage.  Game developers are cancer with the players, constantly worsening the game and adding in just more pay to win aspects to the shop, all of which cost about $30-40 just for a permanent single weapon. Having added almost no extra maps besides 2 small arena modes and 2 open conflict (kill on sight) versions of the already present ones.  No graphical updates, and the only vehicle diversity among players you'll see or hear is either loud crotch grabbing rap music or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over compensating short â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ metal/hard rock with only either Humvee vehicles to troll payers with ramming outside of missions, or a mustang based car thats only got speed on its side.  Faction balance is also thrown away, enforcers seem to be a high risk, high reward play style, with the only way to gain money being missions or alot from arrests. You can earn money through impounding stolen vehicles and evidence delivery or witnessing but good luck as most players on criminals are smart to remain unwitnessable and rarely use any vehicle but their own unless they are new, making enforcer faction practically impossible to earn a decent cash sum up on unless you get good gear. On the other hand criminals can get money practically anywhere, and can reach a $1000-2000 bounty extremely quickly, before being unwitnessable by just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing away from normally quiet areas. Giving criminals an almost endless suply of cash when needed, as well as having the population majority based there. (probably due to that.)  You know how i mentioned arresting criminals in apb as an enforcer? Good luck as well, without the stun shotguns or the taser you stand no chance from premium weapons or rather really any guns. The AR based one requires 7 hits of a 20 round magazine and when players are jumping and running speedy gonzales, then your bound to have almost no spare ammo.  The character customization is amazing, and personally this game's selling point, but again, its squandered by the fact that you cant unlock anything clothing wise fast enough to expand customization. Though if your a good artist you can make a pretty penny from the marketplace from your clothing creations, and probably could turn a profit that way.   The map lay outs and draw distance is honestly some of the worst i've seen. The draw distance has only ever gotten worse becuase people complained about snipers, now its at 100 meters, where litterally any pistol could outgun you, so the only 'snipers' you'll see are corner peekers and jump shooters. When this game has so many potential campaing spots with hard to reach manners, and dont give me the anti-camp â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Its a legitimate defense strategy in video games if given the option, you complaining about it is the same thing as the allies saying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you to germany during WW1 for using submarines when it was a practical and obvious choice for the war of attrition.  On top of the draw distance all the mission lay outs are CQC based, litterally no sniping spots are able to oversee the positions of objectives, and this brings me to another major flaw:  THE RED â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING NAME TAG. AT THE MAX DRAW DISTANCE your given an extremely bright, red, nametag thats litterally visible to everyone even looking around, and this litterally makes it impossible to flank, snipe, or even set up actual good coordinated stationary defensive ambushes.  I do like one aspect of the gameplay and its that the minimap is only gunfire, and audio based. You will not see enemies on the minimap if they make no noise, or are not spotted (good luck not being spotted for reason above.)  The ranking system for pvp is also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, golds can ACTIVELY put themselves lower rank, thus fighting people litterally lower tier than them, think of CSGO an global elite versus new players to the game. Which msot of the time you wont see green tier servers (which are the only locked ones.) having player counts enough to support new players healthily.  The vehicle handling on almost every early-mid tier vehicle is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and delayed. Taking a full second to actrually obey a command to turn or such, the only exception is fast cars, which leads me to believe its speed based. Meaning all those mustang based car users (forgot actual name.) are, again, getting the best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the game.   I give this game a 2/10.  I'll only rarely even think of touching this game, and thats mostly for customization amazingness, but like i said, thats really its only selling point. BF: HARDLINE Was legitimately better than this game in every field but its Dead on PC, the only reason this isnt the case is everyone loves the customization thats never present in any other shooter. That and the P2W buddies are willing to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on their OP weapons which the devs refuse to nerf. (check the forums, youll never see patch notes for weapons that involving decreasing or increasing any stats unless they are sniper rifles or other weapons that are never used. The AK47 (N-tec) was one of the only competitive rifles to use against SMGs and they nerfed its tap fire, but they havent even touched the commonly used p2w weapons.)  My recomendation for improvement: Kill this game, and actively dont play any gamers-first games, if we're lucky theyll do a 180 turn and actrually balance it once they see profits go down (this is what happens with games like warface which was a notoriously bad P2W before finally shaping up and are now semi-decent F2P games.).  Otherwise, i dont see hope for this game. Its loosing a small amount of players every 2 weeks, which is honestly a good sign, and it finally lost its positive status which was litterally just people trying to sympathize with the game due to its character creation aspects and unique cops vs criminals....or nostalgia. All of which never address the issues of the game or handling balance issues seriously enough.

4853	0	a	Don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in play this game  is cancer  I broke a chair
4854	0	a	THIS GAME DONT WORK ;) for me  
4855	0	a	Right well played the game for a while and i must say it could be fun if you enjoy unfear match ups and almost impossiable leveling up. The game could use some help in combat CUZ the headshots do same amount of damage and taking cover is ussless most of the time , custermizing is a ******* pain and finaly making money if you dont do ingame purchase is slow and repetative. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FOR ALL YOU LOOKING TO GET THE GAME DONT!!!!!!!!!
4856	0	a	it's like when you click the video with the really cool and interesting looking thumbnail only to realize what you came for is not actually in the video  its just pay 2 win, you cant buy a gun permanently without a trillion coins or real money same with everything else  summary:  https://youtu.be/Qg4SVGFbPZk?t=65 
4857	0	a	I played a total of 14 hrs. I would not recommend this game for some reason.  1: you can't permanently keep a gun after buying it with real world money and would only last 10 days  2: gameplay is bad  3:erverybody even your own team can be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ most of the time. 
4858	0	a	Honestly I would not reommend this game. When you start its quite fun doing missions and stuff but after sometime you get bored and realize all the missions are the same none of them are different. Well of course they are diffrent but very similar. The customization is great i hav had alot of fun with that but money is needed and getting it is very boring i mostly just played the game to custmoize my charater but after an hour of customizing i realzie i dont hav enough money lol.and its very anoying it is highly possible to be walking around then you would get shot with a rocket launcher or when hackers join and kill everyone also another thing is that the maps are incredibly small which also makes it even more boring. So i really wouldnt recommend this game to others.  The only way i would recommed this game is if they:  1) improve and expand map size 2) Add diverse and new longer missions 3) remove hackers 4) add more ways to make money 5) improve or redsign vehicle physics (or the traction and torque and thoes tins) 6) add first person. 7) improve AI 8) add aircrafts? (only if the map size is increased) 9) add more attachments to weaponry and make weapons customizable. :)
4859	0	a	If you want a spawn and get kiled simulator get this. if you would like to smash windows and steal the same car to get the same â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ youve stolen to sell over and over again get this. if you want the worst possible community in the world get this game.  This game is like cancer had a baby with hitler then hitlers cancer baby â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed stalin  it would be more beneficial to drink bleach you would have a far better experience.   Real review: i played this game for 28 hours, The only time i had fun was the clothing and cars. but after about 11 hours the game got so repetetive all you did was smash windows to get some items put them in your car then drive to some place miles away to sell them. the misions seemed somewhat uninspired it was either kill these people or get this thing to that place. Then the market oooooh the market...you had to smash windows do missions and sell sperm or organs just to buy anyhting off the market now some things are of reasonable price but everything else is just so damn overpriced it cost millions no billions to buy a single gun or car. altogether 28 hours was more than enough to know that i love to hate this game.
4860	0	a	Now I dont have 1000 hours plus in this game like some people here but Ive seen enough to make a fair verdict. As a noob its hard to pick up like most games. But in order to combat the higher ranking played s you either must get MLG or pay 40 bucks for a weapon. (real moeny) You could buy the weapon for a few days but then after that your screwed. I am no means good at the game but I'd like to think Im more of a novice as I was ranked silver 2 I believe? (This is actualy decent in this game not like CSGO) The whole conecpt is pretty cool and the customization amazing. But the whole combat and progression system is really hard to get used to. If anyone has anything to say about my verdict (like my opion matters) please tell me, am I just bad? am I using the wrong guns? Or am I just doing everything wrong? But for now, this game needs some serious balancing issues.
4861	0	a	This game sucks horsecock, DO NOT INSTALL THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! even tho you aint doing mission and still are on tutorial u can get killed and has to waste another 3 hours on thes hitty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game. I promise you that will will uninstall this asap. I got 1 day premium and it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up the game and my pc with 8gb ram ran this game smooth 3 hrs ago but after 3 hrs playhing this game it turned into complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

4874	0	a	run while you still can
4875	0	a	What is wrong with this game ? They let me make an account and after that they told me I'm too young. When I finally entered the game I realise how garbage is it.
4876	0	a	IT IS CRAP 
4877	0	a	game sucks don't download
4878	0	a	So I decided to change my old review since its been some years and the game had updates. But sadly the only updates were box updates. Not really anything fun to do except have some awesome looking customizations to anything. You can get sniped by a pistol from miles away, unload a whole clip on someone do no damge. So many funny things that will make you question what is life. Just play the game and expect having cool customizations. Don't expect anything else.
4879	0	a	This game sucks... You are level 1 with the shitiest weapon that deals less than they regen per second. At level 1 you are instantly paired up vs max ranks that usually one shot you and spawn camp you. AND THE PERFORMANCE OOOOOH MY GOD, one second you have 60 fps in another you have 10-15 fps. And believe me its not only me its everyone. Don't download this game it sucks.
4880	0	a	Bad optimization, has a lot of bugs and the Dev's don't fix them Countlessly,shity server couldn't keep up  the DEV No communication, lies and not listening to the community  DON'T PLAY THIS GAME! Atleast not now. It as been release more then 6 years ago, and its sill in alfa '-' GG WP G1 :)
4881	0	a	looks terrible is terrible the only thing good is that it is free
4882	0	a	I dont recommend this game. 2 hours in loading ....
4883	0	a	This game is an awesome idea,but there is just too many mistakes made in it.  First of all its complicated,atleast it was for me. No real tutorial rather than text. Pro players in starter area. Glitches. Pay to win.
4884	0	a	I'll probably get lynched for saying this, but there's nothing to do in this game. In addition to the lack of activity, the two main elements of the game - driving and shooting - feel cheap, weird and unrewarding. There's a big fan following though, so you might like it. I didn't.
4885	0	a	I barely played this game. When I opened it the load times were awful and it ran terribly and I seem to remember it crashing once or twice. When I finally got the game going properly I was completely at a loss for what to do and none of the other players were of any help. Overall 2/10, bad community, bad game.
4886	0	a	I do think this game is fun, but it is broken at the same time. The radar sucks in this game, there is hackers. But there is hackers in so many games that I play on here. It's kind of like H1Z1: Just Survive with cops and robbers, that is the best way i can explain it. Your best bet is to go in with people you know   Edit: After playing this game quite a bit, it is a play to win. You want to pay to win? You will be amazing at this game, there is a lot of hackers and rage quitting will happen. Best way to play is to go in with people that you know, it makes it easier and fun. But you will ALWAYS run into trolls and hackers no matter what.
4887	0	a	I downloaded the game when me and my friend wanted to play a game with some entertainment value. Kinda hard to find that when everyone is teleporting right next to you while you are shooting at them from across the street.  This is what I get for trying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games again...
4888	0	a	Day by Day game dying cause lot of hackers and bad Very bad server perfomance! If u want to get free cancer please join the game! Gamersfirst or as many people calling them Moneyfirst dont care about this game anymore. But they care A LOT about ur money so feel free to throw some money on their faces! Have fun!
4889	0	a	I have recently gotten back into this game, alot has changed but not all for the better.  Aside from its incredable redeeming characteristic in its diversity in customization, it is dificult to play with out getting upset, or feeling cheated. The weapon system, while reballanced slightly, remains unballanced and biased to paying players. There is still no way for a free player to obtain permanant weapons regardless of their playtime and support. Also, a word of warning for new players, G1 apears to be more concerned in making money than securing their game, paying into APB:R seems to justify players who use 3rd party programs (ie artificial aim) these players tend to have a higher concentration in the 'gold' rank.  While the world(s) are large, they lack the ability to captivate players. The only anarchic activity is played out by players, making the non-player enviroment feel boring and unrelated. Every citizen of the wold is weak and feble (killed by 1 shot from any weapon). Contact storys are boring and disregardable, and sometimes get in the way. In all the wold only feels like it was designed for PVP while i could have a more chaotic nature with a few AI alterations. If the wold felt more dangerous the storyline and premise would feel more believeable.  With the occasional trolling with cars and symbols this game, and the sparce pairing with decent  people, this game is worth playing, so long as you dont let the bull get to you. Please dont pay into G1 as it only encourages lazy developement and biased gameplay, generating a disturbingly Pay to Win enviroment that drives out good people.   This game is worth the play, if only an example to build off of and improve.  2 stars/5 and a comendation for updating glitches and issues that broke the game.
4890	0	a	Literally just play GTA Online instead
4891	0	a	I wouldn't force Hitler to play this game.
4892	0	a	The developers should be ashamed of turning such a great game into the most notorious P2W garbage. They better upgrade the engine soon or I quit APB.
4893	0	a	I can't tell if I like this game or not because I seriously can't tell if I'm playing the game right or not. I've never played something that's kept me utterly confused six months after playing it.
4894	0	a	  Its a fun game. But its pay to win. Which no one likes games like that.
4895	0	a	APB Reloaded for dummys 1 download the game 2 sign in 3 fail signing in 4 make an account 5 sign in again 6 fail signing in sign in 7 fail signing in 8 realise you needed to confirm your email 9 confirm your stupid email 10 sign in for the last friggin time! 11 finally it works... 12 create your character anticipating that it has the best creation system ever 13 start the game with a crappy character 14 game lags like friggin crazy!! 15 realize, it wasn't love at first sight 2/10
4896	0	a	The admins are clueless, the mods who are not employed with the company are ignorant, the cheaters have taken over the game, Deep Silver is ruining their game, the admins are nowhere to be seen, the only employee who appears to have any form of discussion with players is CM Tiggs, i never met her, even though when i was a GM/CM over at T3Entertainment, i heard she use to be a CM with HanbitSoft, even though I'm not sure if that was true or not. I have nothing against her personally, but she needs to do something with the forum mods and get rid of them.   Depsite the BS. I click no on recommend 'in general'&gt; But read below , because despite all the crap with this game, I'm not against anyone playing it. But listen good, DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS COMPANY MONEY. Everything i mention above , they don't deserve our money until they do something about the things which i mention. And until the cons below are fixed.   NOTE: IF ANYTHING IF YOU MUST , DO GIVE MONEY FOR PREMIUM, ITS THE ONLY THING WORTH BUYING. BECAUSE WITHOUT PREMIUM THE GAME IS POINTLESS TO PLAY. But read below about that.  Pros+ Intro Music  Character Customaztion Car Customzation Music in General Feature to add your own Custom Music Driving around  OCA Whipser is very nice gun to use.  Cons- The game itself Gameplay is boring Missions are repetitive Only 2 maps They removed the old threat system which made the game run, i told them once they removed it, it will runied the game and lose players . As you can see they didn't listen to me lol.  Game popluation is very low Downgraded graphics Cheaters/Hackers Everywhere Lame Anti-cheat method Lack of GM's Firing Good GM's Fight Club Mode is lazy, which means, instead of them designing new areas for FC, they took the main 2 maps and use some of that and made that into 2 Maps. Now that wouldn't be a bad thing, if they added new areas/maps every 6 months. But its the same 2 FC Maps for what 4 years now. Very very Toxic Community, never add friends you don't know IRL, never group with anyone, never trade with anyone.  No PVE Only PVP Macro users Closet Hackers Corrupt GM's( now ) Forum is toxic due to mods not being employed with the company. Tech Mech honestly should be fired becasue of this. He's letting people who are not even employed with the company run his forum. But wait, Where is Tech Mech? Nobody has seen or heard from him in months.  Asylum after 5 years still not completed The main 2 maps are still unfinished. Very poor performance Without premium game is pointless to play  ...................................................  Bottom line: If you choose to play this game, you will get bored. Its like GTA but done in a very poor way. David Jones the Creator should be glad he left. Do not give money to this game. And oh yea, there's suppose to be a engine upgrade coming out, but the staff never listens and due to some NDA ( Which i highly doubt is in place ) they can't show anything. But wait, they already show 3 videos and 15 pictures. But now they can't show anything lol. So play this game, but never give money to them, if you must though, find alt ways to earn premium, or if you must, only buy premium and nothing else and use the market to get things you want. The market in game.   Such a great game years ago. My advice, and i strongly suggest you do this for the best alt for APB:  Saints row 3 and 4 Hellgate London (which has even more customaztion compred to APB) Sleeping Dogs Crackdown 3, which is being worked on by RTW staff and Dave Jones himself.  NOTE: I have no inteintion on fully coming back to this game until i see what the engine upgrade is going to be like. If they didn't add blue tracers back, the old threat system or 'more importanlty' HQ Bloom, I'm never coming back.
4897	0	a	Never in my life have thought that potential is the only good aspect of a game. The environment is toxic, not so much the people but due the fact that after 3 years of playing I've determined that this is not a 3de person shooter but competitive credit card swiping or job creation for your friendly neighborhood hacker. In essence this game is only fun after a patch for the first 10 or so hours.
4898	0	a	only played for 3.7 hours but to me it was meh its your choice if you want to play it though
4899	0	a	Pay 2 Die from Hackers... Don't bother...
4900	0	a	Extremely p2w
4901	0	a	This is a lot like Grand Theft Auto, if you took GTA and removed a ton of the content, made it nearly impossible to make money, and made it more of a pay to win. If you want to somewhat enjoy this game, you're going to have to shell out more money than it would cost you to just buy GTAV, every single month. So, in other words, just go buy GTAV instead.
4902	0	a	I probably haven't played APB Reloaded enough to call it trustworthy review. Still, there is a reason behind that. First of all, I played APB Reloaded over 2-3 years - first, when I just started my adventure with Steam, then few months later after some update and my last time was maybe half of year ago. Is this game bad? Not really. Is around 10 hours all the fun you can get from it? Probably not. When I started to play this game, I looked for something GTA-like but focused on online play.   And I found it. Played for a little while with my friend and we had some fun. Still, day after I started to play once again San Adreas multiplayer. After some time played it again and sadly, suddently this error on 32bit operation systems game wasn't playable at all. Some time later I changed my OS and tried it again. Sure, there were some players but once again I had fun only for short time. Played some missions together and one day uninstalled. Maybe it wasn't really for me? Or maybe because of lags, since there were countless time when I emptied my whole magazine shooting on enemy and didn't managed to kill him, only to find out that there was lag and I'm already dead.  I know one thing - it's free to play game, you can at least check it out. Maybe your experience with it will be much better and you will find something that is worth spending in your time. I probably won't install APB Reloaded again and even if I will, I doubt that my opinion will be changed.
4903	0	a	  Opinion/other stuff
4904	0	a	GTA but online. Super fun. Download it!  Edit:  I used to love this game, but it has been ruined by G1. The game is entirely pay to win, there's a huge amount of hackers, no communication from G1 about what's going on with the game, and when I just recently tried to play the game again, I couldn't even connect to the server. This game would have done well in the hands of capable developers and publishers, but unfortunately that's not the case.
4905	0	a	I dislike the clunky controls, yeah, theyre all customisable but its a game, i just wanted to be dropped straight into this with the controls set up for Xbox controller without having to faff about.Tthe graphics are 2004 spec, and leave a lot to be desired. if you like clicking menus and mucking around customising T-shirts, and bits and pieces like your nose, and the shape of your lip then it may be what you're looking for. Sadly i wasnt. I was looking for something to get stuck into, like GTA, but instead its just menu after menu of tiny icons and numbers followed by crappy visuals and clunky controls. I gave up in the end and generally regret wasting my time downloading the 5.3GB, failed updates and a restart, mucking around with making an account and creating a character.  Not for me im afraid, will be un-installing shortly as i lack the patience to withstand the drawn out menus to ever achieve anything, let alone control the character properly or be pleased by the visuals, Sorry
4906	0	a	This game was fun for a while, but quickly got boring. Along with that you've got the most cringe-worthy and toxic of communities, and you just end up with a hot mess that likes to charge you 40-bucks for Pay to Win guns, and overall it's just not worth the effort.  This was a game we all looked forward to and drooled over... but in the end it didn't live up to what it could have potentially offered. And honestly I think a lot of that had to do with gamersfirst being in charge of it. Quit a slimey company, especially if you read any of their official responses on their forums.
4907	0	a	run away before its too late
4908	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Game  Pay for Anything

4911	0	a	Literally 10 minutes into the game, and I gave up. Now that says something.
4912	0	a	The lag you'll experience is going to be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing unreal. Besides, so many p2w weapons have been added which can only be received through mystery boxes, this game went from awesome to complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trash. Don't waste your time on it. Your skill doesn't count when everyone's teleporting due to the lag and p2w â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ spray the AMG Medusa all around you. Idk why g1 is so money hungry, little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s
4913	0	a	At first I thought I found the basic version of GTA V but I was dissapointed. Even though it says 5.5hours on my profile, 4 of those hours were spent trying to log in. My computer back then wasn't a pathetic piece of equipment but was actually rocking a core i7 @ 2.2Ghz, 6GB RAM and a GT520M. So it all landed back to APB having a bad community and little to no support. After successfully logging in, I found the game to lack anything that would keep me hooked and want to come back and play it again.
4914	0	a	Didn't play for two minutes before I was shot and killed by my own team for doing a mission objective. Tried a few more times and same thing. What a great way to start a game,being tk'd and cursed out. This was on the American server so it could be different on European/Asian servers. Community ruined it as constant barrage of insults filling the message box for the most inane things(not even related to my own noobiness). It was like a bunch of junior highers hitting puberty at the same time and not knowing what to do with all the new hormones invading their system. Instead of saying 'hey we don't raid this because it gives us a serious disadvantage or hold out here' you get called 'stupid *&amp;^%()$ trainee' for doing what the game instructs. Don't even want to know if there is a good game underneath it all. Eve online's community is more forgiving.  Edit:The concept and gameplay are quite solid but the lag is terrible. I know it's not just on my end due to user reviews along with people screaming in unison about it while playing. I just can't give it a thumbs up as of yet.
4915	0	a	UPDATE--9_7_2016 If you guys know by now the game now simply a PayToWin! I sorry G1, after i see what marketplace sale with useless and dumb equipment and other stuff, i have no choice to set this not recommend. You guys(G1) said going to update the engine, but for me, i suggestion move on! Meaning make new game,new APB, advance than GTA5 and MGS5, combine 2 into 1...  I hope one day someone made that happen!  --This is the preview review below when the game was great before, feel free to read what i felt if you willing to!--  For those who wanna step up into hardcore battle similar like COD and GTA stlye, here want you looking for!  Honestly i have few word of reason that recommend and not recommend for you guyz..So here me out then! Why i'm recommend?  This game have customize character, art design for clothing and cars and make cool music that the game provide the tool they have~  It was amazing how you can choose you own way depending what you like it.Well you can't make any art design and music of your own, why not buy other creativity stuff then. The gameplay was awesome just like gta but it most liking of COD battle stlye when health can regen itself if you take cover! And now, why i do not recommend?  1st, the game is hard.Few players that you will might encounter was a pro or averge that think themself they are the best but not and among of them might mock you or takedown many times when you about to learn how the game work.After that you might give up by the stress from them and play other game~  2nd, Some newbies give up this game easy,right?...Well some newbie might not giveup but will break the rule of the game.Yup! that right, other you will encounter is cheater and hacker that might ruining the game and your's fun times.  Lastly, well everyone already know that some server you enter is lagging. No matter where you choose, it will still lag.  Lagging might come if your internet slow, sometime is your grapfic card or memory ram not enough for the game to run it. But this year lagging alway be there wheather your pc low or high that another topic that ruining the game else well...but hopefully, next year i think, G1 try to fix the problem of lagging so hope is work.But if the next year didnt fix the problem, well it up to you guy to decide then.     Overall, the gameplay, customize character, design stuff is really awesome for me but sadly there might few downfall to it, so it 8.5 out the 10 for me.  The game very old now, so if the Game Creator planning to make 2nd installment with improvement gameplay most similar like Metal Gear Solid 5, i definintly want help out the character design then~ :D
4916	0	a	Not that good tbh
4917	0	a	An awesome game , ruined by his publisher. Try it just for fun , if u wanna win , you will have to pay.
4918	0	a	great game, however, still awful controller support, down right unplayable for those who don't use keyboard and mouse
4919	0	a	When I saw videos of this game I thought it looked fun. I was wrong, I'm not paying just to get a in-game gun, car, clothing item or anything like that. No more pay to win games for me!
4920	0	a	game just ins't fun anymore. This game has barely had any updates in the past few years. They are just milking this game dry. Please spend your hard earned money elsewhere than on this POS.
4921	0	a	ye while youre at it, you might as well shoot your self in the knee
4922	0	a	It's dead and even before it went dead i hated it
4923	0	a	Pay2win, car controls are garbage, extremely CPU and Memory intensive for very poor graphic quality. Enforcer criminal catching functionality is extremely unrewarding and labour intensive.
4924	0	a	There's a lot of reasons giving this thumbs down let me just give you some reasons before you play this.  First you'll hear kids on the mic flaming so bad, you'll see disrespectful words all over the chat people disrespecting each others every time  Joining gta V is faster than joining this game  Unfair play as you gotta pay money to get a godlike weapons and 80% of losing the missions, people playing there for years like robots killing you with a shotgun from a far distance  Glitches everywhere, you send APB support a ticket and they don't respond as i sent them a ticket a year ago how to fix my game i didn't get any reply from them  Hard to drive cars you gotta get used to them  As you're in a mission and you responding to something and finally get used to the cars people will come with a truck and ram your car to a wall and then it'll show that you suicide as they're not even your teammates or enemys to hurt you  Your teammates sometimes get butthurt and they killing you, after asking them why they trolling the game and killing me what i get is 'Because you're a really bad player learn how to play you dumbâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and you responded to the mission late so pls uninstall apb'    The game is free like there's no point going against the game and giving it thumbs down but again you gotta pay to be a godlike you gotta pay a lot of money.
4925	0	a	This game has potential, but GamersFirst (lol) is clearly incapable of giving it the attention it needs to reach that potential. The game is mostly fun, but to have that fun, you have to be prepared to deal with lag/microstutters, hitreg, botters, hackers, crap server performance, exploiters, pornography (player made images), racism, sexism, threats of real world violence, and a near complete lack of GamersFirst presence on the servers. I say near-complete, because there are occasions when the staff makes an appearance, but those are extremely rare occurances.   I would love to recommend this game, but i simply cannot. I have logged almost 300 hours into this game, and i've watched it mostly degrade in that time.  Best i can tell anyone is, STAY AWAY from this game until GamersFirst (can't even say that with a straight face) either gets the game under control, or sells it to a company that will.
4926	0	a	Well, the game is an good Game. BUT. There are many hackers in the game and seriously, this game is pay2win.  I payed more than 50â‚¬ and much work in it to trade my legendaries in this game. And i got banned from GamersFirst.  GamersFirst Support is just poor. They answer very quick, but never give you the best solution.  There are many overpowered weapons that never get patched. Thats the only thing that destroys the Game.  Im still playing the game, i enjoy it. Tho if it is really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off.  I dont know why, but i just like it.  But this game, is Pay2Win and upâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Dont play this Game if you dont like: Pay2Win, Hackers, Scammers, a poor Support, and reasonless Bans.

4931	0	a	The game and the idea behind it is good. But the Pay-to-Win system just kills the experience for all newcomers. Basically premium players are guarantee to win, and in frustration all new (none-premium) players don't last too long, and forced to abandon the game. This game will die, unless they change the Pay-to-Win system into more fairer progression level system and true and fairer matchmaking..
4932	0	a	I dont have that many hours put into APB when I wrote this review. But from the time I've played APB at the lowest graphic settings and with 20 FPS I currently think its a decent game. It IS ONE OF THE FEW games that allow you to customize the absolute hell out of you and your cars. The combat system is OK, although infinite stamina isnt that realistic. 'Headshots' do the same damage on your head and your foot, which disables headshot instakills, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Now about the buying system in APB. You buy a guy in the game, a decent gun. Do you have it? Yes, for 10 days. ARMAS marktplace, you can buy quite a lot of decent and nice stuff. Like nice packs which can include clothes, weapons, attachments, modifications, vehicles and emotes. BUT the best guns in the game you HAVE to buy with REAL money. Which makes this game lean even more to a P2W. Now if they were to put the best guns and every gun in the in-game shop which you buy with your well earned in-game money AND make them last FOREVER and not for only 10 days. I mean, you dont buy a car IRL to drive 10 days with it and then bring it back to the car dealer, do you? You dont go to the mall to buy some bread, eat it, then crap it out and then bring it back to the mall, do you?  I would give this game a rating of 6.5/10. It has amazing customization, an interesting server setup and a free-roam to mission 'map' but the developers are greedy, very very very very greedy. They want you to BUY somewhat EVERYTHING in the game to keep it FOREVER. Thats not how it works. Not at all.
4933	0	a	this game. issue after issue. so, first off. after opening it the 2nd time. the launcher was scanning. infinitely. for god knows what. after disabling IPv6 protocol, it worked. but when i tried to launch game. it did absolutely nothing. well, it opened chrome tab, 'like us on facebook to get 1 day free premium' (big whoop one god damn day..) after pressing launch AGAIN. it opened a splash screen. then opened another one. after leaving it like this for couple mins. nothing. so far, from my experience. this game. not worth 1 hr of downloading. (5GB from steam, then came with 500MB update from launcher, which only downloaded at 25-50% of my max download limit..)  (as i havent been able to play this game yet. dont take in consideration of my 'do you recomend this game' as u may not experience this issues like i have.)
4934	0	a	This game is laggy as hell with a constant fps of 8-15. Also, this game is a true pay2win game.

4941	0	a	Well... this is a game and should not take it seriously but back to the topic I, ve been playing this game for quite some time and i would say this is an ok game. It used to be really bad but past couple of weeks they improved this game a lot and there is no P2W wep they are all reskins. most of the hackers are gone and server will get engine update soon so right now this game is good but then again if you re willing to spend money then make sure you have lots cuz this games sucks it like a bat since one reskin costs around $30.  Take it back: this game is sht
4942	0	a	Before I start anything, play the game first, make your own decisions and then come back and read the reviews. Reviewers shouldnt tell you to play or not to play the game, its so the devs (and sometimes the players) can see what is good and or bad about the game.  ________________________________________________________________________________  With that being said lets begin, I will chop this review into 3 segments, in-depth pros, in- depth cons, some issues or insights and then my conclusion. ________________________________________________________________________________  Pros -----  - The game is smooth i was able to run the game on high settings with a PC that I spent $400 on (and all the parts were used as well) if you can sacrifice the graphics just a bit you can run the game at 70-90 fps, with the frame rate dropping only when there's a HUGE row of explosions happening all at once (which is very rare).  - The game is OPEN WORLD, the fact that you can run around causing havoc or if you're a goody two shoes you can silence that havoc, is amazing, there's so much you can do in this game, you can rob random citizens you can crash into a shop window and loot the store, or you can patrol the city streets looking for criminals to arrest, you can drive around recklessly or you can just cruise if that's your style.  - The Choice of preloaded music (while not ALL of it is my taste) really hypes you up when you're driving around looking for that cop to run over, And if that's not your taste then you can upload YOUR OWN MUSIC from your desktop using the in game browser to search for that folder full of music you probably got through illegal means...  - The options, this game is SERIOUS about its customizability, and I mean SERIOUS, not only can you edit the clothes you buy if you wanted, you can customize your car, your tattoos, your characters face, and body in general, you can create your own death song, for when you kill an enemy so they can hear your music mocking them when they just got blown away, there's an awesome market and bidding system that was catered for the player so they can find what they want easily and quickly, and every gun has an unlockable skin you can acquire through achievements or special events that are going on!  ________________________________________________________________________________  Cons -----  - Im gonna start off with the matchmaking, because it is the MAIN reason this game is deterring people away from continuing to play this game. The matchmaking sucks MAJOR OX â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. players are split into ranks Green, bronze, silver and then gold, each rank having a deeper ranking than the one before. The first time you load up the world and join you are automatically readied up, which is cool and you can quickly switch it off if you just wanted to roam around and see the sights. Your first day in your Green ranked, once a match has started you and your team will fight against another team and guess what, most of the time they are all GOLD, yes GOLD the highest leveled player against a player who JUST joined, and this isn't gonna stop now, no no no it'll keep happening over and over and over again till you quit because you're going 0 and 19 (K/D) if you delve in deeper into the server selection (on the advanced menu, where you can be specific on which server you wanna join) EVERY GOLD, and I mean EVERY, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING, GOLD, is on a bronze server. Its ridiculous, and they purposefully do this if you haven't noticed, the servers are spread out so each rank has their own server so bronze can play against bronze silver against silver and gold against gold, but no they don't give 2.5 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about that and just join in so they can rake up that nice money and achievements.  (more about it here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/113400/discussions/0/357285562482069506/  )  - The weapon system, oh my god, the weapon system. When you first start off you're given this toy assault rifle, not only is it meant to only be able to kill an enemy bronze, but you're stuck with it for most likely your entire play through, you won't make enough money to buy a new gun, which you can only own for 7-10 days UNLESS you spend a huge sum of money to own it permanently, which isn't that bad if you're making a lot of money.  - Game population, doing /pop in the game chat will show you how many people are playing in your US/NA server (last time I did it showed me it was only 300 players playing 300!! not all on one server no they are all spread out with the bronze server ranking about 80 players while the rest 220 are all dispersed into small 10 or 8 player servers)  - Flat our PAY TO WIN/FUN, if you ACTUALLY want to have fun in this game then you need to borrow your moms credit card. or if you can afford handing over your hard earned cash then go ahead, because this game is going to beat you and frustrate you and stress you enough to force you to hand over your cash. you want to get cool guns and cars? Money. Cool clothes? Money. Wanna customize your car to more than SEVEN, YES SEVEN SINGLE graphics to put on your car and or clothes)  - Community, the community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, its cancerous, and toxic, worse than 5-year-old Minecraft kids, worse than GTA V kids, and the entire LOL community combined. they are snobby, unhelpful, bigoted, racist, closed minded, rich edgy tweens and eugenes. if you are paired up against an entire team of gold and you die, god help you your team mate(s) isn't(arent) higher leveled than you (most likely golds) because if they are and you die EVEN ONCE you are going to get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on for than entire match because you a helpless new player was killed by a player that probably played this game for years. You are going to get called a 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ie' 'noob â™¥â™¥â™¥' and 'fragits).    _____________________________________________________________________________  This game doesn't care about the bugs, or the hackers, or the community, or the game itself either. Its worse than a pyramid scheme. 'Gamersfirst' really should just become EA's snobby son. Regardless of all I said, (and if you actually read all of that then wtf is wrong with you) play the game, create your own opinion and write a review of it and send it to the devs. The ONLY way this game is going to change is by speaking to the devs and getting in contact with them, and just like EA the only language they speak is money, so to do that, the game has to either start DYING OUT which is going to happen very soon unless something changes or if they start losing people who are paying a monthly fee to be a premium. _____________________________________________________________________________
4943	0	a	Was a great game and all, but some of even the most top players recently and FINALLY got caught in a major banwave for hacking.  No longer worth playing when respected members of the community are caught aimbotting after years of doing it.
4944	0	a	Got banned from the game for no reason. 10/10 Would make new account.
4945	0	a	Wellfare GTA 5 Online.  With somehow even more hackers.
4946	0	a	can't get past launcher. not worth the time.
4947	0	a	i lunched iy 5 times and it did not lucnh and then i cant delete it so i dont like the game 
4948	0	a	The game is fun but the community is mostly consisted of a**holes :(
4949	0	a	wow. amd + apb = lag spikes. fix it and maybe it might just about get -1 out of 10
4950	0	a	It was a great game until they change the game. The server so laggy when they put the server together {west and east}. Building load slow, bad community and banned for no reason even if its 'skills'. I believe the banning is causing the game to be low population 'silver is now gold' from what i heard. I hope they fix the game ASAP or its gonna go POOF.
4951	0	a	You will encounter pro players if you are new in game, those players have plenty of premium and P2W weapons you dont stand a chance and thats why this game is dying all new players, are rage quitting because of that, the devs dont care about it because all the Golds are paying in $ Gold/premium hackers are not getting banned, they get supported by game masters.  roughly 54% of the players are hackers, 30% are Pro players and clans and all the rest are randoms and noobs.   gold players play on silver servers to pwn the regular players, the silvers are mad and play on bronze servers because they are tired of getting owned by golds and the bronze players and trainee players are getting pwnd by both and thats why they are leaving this unfair game, you shoud NOT download this game until they fix it or you will have a very frustrating/painful and hard start into this game, which means you are forced to go this way because they will NEVER fix this issue.
4952	0	a	.|. 
4953	0	a	Updates are ruining it, bad tutorial, multipayer is almost dead.
4954	0	a	This game has potenital, it really does!  But its full of hackers, there is nowhere you can go an play where there wont be lots of hackers looking to ruin your day, they have a new anti hack that they says is getting rid of them, but as a player i can tell you i still play against hackers most matches, i cant play it anymore as the hackers just make it unplayable!  Update in 2016, So ive come back to this game and it is still in the same state. They have two antihacks and still the game is FULL of hackers, for the first time in years i redownloaded it and it is still full of them. It is clear that GamersFirst cannot solve the hacker issue and that they also dont care about it. If you put in a ticket about it they will ensure you that they are on top of it. Go into game and it is a different story. I was in a silver district and had been playing for 2 hours, 17 out of 20 matches had a hacker in it. So this game is clearly making no improvements. As much as i hate to say it, Battleye is better then the rubbish being used on APB. The only way this game will become playable is if someone else takes over from gamersfirst. Gamersfirst do not put gamers first at all, they put money first. They are making no attempt to fix this game.  DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, IT WILL DO NOTHING BUT INCREASE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND ANGER YOU!
4955	0	a	WHY CANT I PLALY THIS GAME?? 
4956	0	a	If you're gonna play it, you'll get bored about 2 weeks after.. Not worth the time.   But had potential :#
4957	0	a	Sucks like a camel
4958	0	a	The driving mechanic doe and the in-game perchase neh i rather buy gta v then the in-game perchase
4959	0	a	An awesome game , ruined by his publisher. Try it just for fun , if u wanna win , you will have to pay.
4960	0	a	great game, however, still awful controller support, down right unplayable for those who don't use keyboard and mouse
4961	0	a	This game sucks, it is nothing the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trailers, all you do is go into a mission which has several objectives in it. everyone kills everyone no matter the team. I can't believe I wasted 1.7 hours of my life on this. I'am deleting it off my computer until they fix this laggy â™¥â™¥â™¥ piece of trash game.
4962	0	a	Overall? A massive disappointment I came back to a couple times in hopes it had gotten better. Sadly, it never did.  Such a shame, I loved being a wheelman for people.
4963	0	a	Okay it is a good game totally right but it is always kicking me outta game :( It is not the reason of my 'recommendation'
4964	0	a	Ty for ban PB and GameFirst and ignore me. I played 2 years and U BAN.
4965	0	a	Has potential but it is empty , souless and NOT fun. Would have been great if others (GTA/Saints row IV) had not already beaten them to it.
4966	0	a	Cancer game
4967	0	a	GTA but online. Super fun. Download it!  Edit:  I used to love this game, but it has been ruined by G1. The game is entirely pay to win, there's a huge amount of hackers, no communication from G1 about what's going on with the game, and when I just recently tried to play the game again, I couldn't even connect to the server. This game would have done well in the hands of capable developers and publishers, but unfortunately that's not the case.
4968	0	a	I've been playing this game for 227.7 hours in total. I honestly have mixed opinions about the game. I haven't played it for 6 months, but I can tell you everything about it.  What I really loved about the game itself was:  - The customization features - The cars, weapons, and clothing  - Cooperative players (If you have friends)  But here, are reasons why this game came into a disappointment:  - Bad shooting mechanics - Bad gaming optimization - Laggy servers - Noxious community among players (Hackers, idiots, aimbots, cheaters, etc.) - Unbalanced matchmaking - Misleading tutorials - Too much microtransactions - Greedy developers  What I overall think about the game itself is that it's cool in its own way, but it's not a game that you'll like to play very often. I would recommend this game, but not at the same time. You're free to try it for yourself if you like, but be cautious of what you're gonna face in the game.   In the end, I'll give this game a rating of 5/10.
4969	0	a	I'll be honest, it was very fun at first. The physics for cars, looting, riding aroudn with a friend able to shoot at the cops in the passenger seat... playing your own music in the car(that no one else can hear but you apparently). It has good customization, a bit pricey for good stuff but managable... guns and etc aren't pay 2 win to my knowledge but overall this game was a handful. It's buggy, load screens are rediculously long, there's hardly anyone ever on, the policemen side has WAY too much power in their hands to stop the criminals. Hell, accidentally bumping into something with your car gives you a split second of warning that you could be captured and disabled by a policeman... lucky me, once a policeman sees you... They just stalk you to the ends of the earth(sounds realistic lol) because there's no one else online. The pvp got to bed fun but it overall felt like the game was too dead, too unbalanced, and buggy as hell. This is a potentially nice game but it's just another one of those 'never heard of it' mmo's that vanishes off to the side. I enjoyed the little time I played it, but I can't say it was the best experience for me to recommend to another person.
4970	0	a	This is a great game, fun to play, and enjoyable as you progress through the ranks as either an Enforcer/Criminal.  Unfortunately I will not play this game again, due to the community. Not even 5 minutes will pass without there being some outburst of someone accusing someone else of hacking, or being a noob. Even though there is a solution to this, it will never change on APB's community.  Hackers - Can be resolved through tightening security protocols etc. I mean when someone openly admits they cheat and have spent huge amounts of game-time proving it, as well as accumulating a large amount of reports, they still not banned? This game is not administered. Not at all. And if someone just has to google 'Aimbot for APB' etc just to get a download link and start ruining the game... Then there must obviously be a lack in administration.  As for those who repeatedly call someone noob. Kill team-mates repeatedly. Go AFK or just idle-by. Well done, you have just turned this game against itself. Those high ranked players who wish to be kicked from the team so as to not lose with some new players, achieved by harrassing and killing team-mates. Do they realize that they making the game un-enjoyable for new players. Let me put this simply... NO NEW PLAYERS = EVENTUAL SERVER CLOSURE.  I swear the community is childish. Someone once argued with me because he called me a noob, yet I agreed saying I was new to the game and added that he shouldn't be too hard on new players. Be a little mature, I said. The next 30 minutes of me trying to find out his reason for team killing resulted in him finding out he is 5 years younger than me. After that it was a pure ignore.  So basically, admins must admin the game. Players must not deter new players.
4971	0	a	Complaint: On 2015-09-09, my Gamersfirst account was permanently suspended under the accusation of 'Hacking.' I sent in multiple support tickets asking for a legitimate investigation of my account and a chance for me to entirely explain what I was doing and what I was not doing. However, all of my tickets were closed with the generic copy and paste response that their system sends out when they refuse to be a respectable company and engage in a human conversation. Before my account was suspended, I had been an active member of the community for the game APB:Reloaded and had accumulated up to $2,000 spent for services and items for that game. Not only was I denied any legitimate customer support, I was personally lied to and falsely accused of 'Cheating' by the employee ***** ******' ********** who is the current Community Manager of the game. I was told that I would be allowed to 're-roll' by making a new Gamersfirst account and 'not cheating again' after multiple attempts at getting a human response from the company, however the account I made while I was waiting for any further responses was permanently suspended as well, without any justified reason. Afterwards, ****** personally blocked communications with me over the Steam service on which I had attempted to speak to her through, and not once has responded to any of my emails sent to her company email address. I did not cheat on any of my accounts at any point in time, and this employee personally interfered with any attempts at having my suspension being properly investigated. I had invested THOUSANDS of hours into their service, and had spent TWO THOUSAND dollars to make their service more enjoyable for myself and others, and I was disgustingly treated like I wasn't worth the time to communicate with.  Desired Settlement: At this point in time, it has been over seven months since my original account was suspended and I am no longer interested in having my account restored. I would absolutely demand the chance to personally be contacted either by phone or email by anyone who is capable of providing a human, unbiased conversation on the details of my original suspension, and to explain why I was allowed to be treated the way I was by the specific employee mentioned previously. In fact, I'll even accept a formal apology that I was falsely accused of cheating, and that my suspension was because I had been searching for unreleased content via the game's main executable. If either of these outcomes occurs, I will stop wasting the time of their game moderation team by no longer creating new accounts on a daily basis just so they have to search to remove me from their game repeatedly.  Business Response:  Thank you for contacting us. This account has been permanently terminated due to our staff verifying that it was involved in illegal in-game activities. As our Terms of Use  (www.gamersfirst.com/terms)  and EULA state, this is an explicit violation and necessitates account closure. We apologize such action is necessary and understand your frustration on this matter but we do take all levels of cheating quite and had to make the regrettable decision to close an account. Thank you for taking the time to submit communication through the BBB.  Consumer Response:  Better Business Bureau:  I have reviewed the response made by the business in reference to complaint ID ********, and have determined that this proposed action would not resolve my complaint. For your reference, details of the offer I reviewed appear below.  The response I was given was no different than a copy/pasted message provided when a customer contacts their customer support personally, which provided absolutely no functionally acceptable information on which to discuss this issue, though I appreciate the incomplete sentence about 'cheating.' They say that they don't provide information about bans because it can help cheaters avoid future bans, but in reality they do it because they can screw over paying customers and not provide legitimate proof of any illegal in-game activities. I did not cheat, and had not cheated, on any of my active GamersFirst accounts until they showed their true colors and I had nothing further to lose. I appreciate the effort of the BBB in their attempt at getting a reasonable excuse from this pathetic excuse of a company. ** *** **** ***** ** * ***** ******* *** ******** **** ** *** ****** ******  Regards, ******* *******
4972	0	a	My grandfather was a demolitions expert in Vietnam. His wife was an O.R. nurse. Other 2 grandparents lived through the depression. All this strength in my familyline and it couldn't save me from this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cancer of a game...  APB Reloaded is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing joke. Yes i realize i have over 600+ hours. The only reason i do is because i was dickin around with friends.  When i decided to start getting more into it. I began to realize this has got the be THE SINGLE WOOOOOORST GAAAAAAME EVVVVEEEERRR.  The devs literally are telling you to go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself with every possible pixel in this game. I have a list of pros and cons for APB Reloaded.   Pros:  -Unsurpassed Character Customazation -Wide range of weapons to use. -Mugging and Raiding storefronts. -Massive amount of clothes to buy (ingame money for regular clothes. cool clothes cost real money.)  Cons:  Holy mother of all that is holy, where the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do i begin... -Matchmaking is horrendous. -CASHGRABCASHGRABCASHGRABCASHGRAB -Hackers, botters, dirty cheap unskilled players who tbag even when they lose. -This community is such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥how it makes MOBA ragers look like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Mother Theresa. -Only 2 maps. 2 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MAPS. This game has been out for over 6 years. -Completely lifeless dev team.  -Did i mention cashgrab? -No teamwork at all. -More hackers. -Rerolls. so...many...â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing...rerolls. For those who don't know. A reroll is a person who starts up a new accoutn with prior knowledge of the game. Nothing wrong with that except for the fact the game is programmed for newly incoming players who just made an account and downloaded, to have whats called 'beginners luck'. Its programmed so that you will do well for a while and want to keep playing. People use this 'luck' and a p2w weapon to be unstoppable. -P2W. its so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing p2w its vomit worthy. Yet the asshats in this game seem to think otherwise. -Dirty players who purposfully go out of their way to farm kills and rank up off new players.  -HORRIBLE COMMUNITY OF HACKERS.  -Seriously do NOT ever play this game.  -Seriously.  0/10 Didn't proff read my longass review. It's the internet who cares?
4973	0	a	It's like Saints Row. It's ok, not the best and not the worst.
4974	0	a	It sucks that players that want to invest in the game itself, have much bigger advantage than others.
4975	0	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible.
4976	0	a	This game Refuses to work.
4977	0	a	Worthless game with worthless developers. They ban innocent players rather than banning the actual hackers. I'll never recommend anyone to play this game even if it's free. You'll regret it whatsoever.
4978	0	a	the game is great when the devs cared. they promised the pc community an updated engine of the game . still never got it all they want is more money and there goes their loyal players. the EU got the engine upgrade which makes me believe they don't have enough funds to make an engine upgrade to the US since they stalled it and recently came out with the xbox one version of the game. makes me believe their going to try to milk money from the xbox version and upgrade the US engine with that. this game is struggling to survive against GTA. this game has potential but its help back by a crappy dev team that only fueled by greed. they are also not so transparent about anything , its clear and thats why people left this game. the game is not bad if your new to it, but definitely don't waste your money here its not worth it, i made that mistake and regret it. game is worth playing though lots of fun especially with friends.
4979	0	a	I used to recomend this game, but after 6+ years of playing it there has been so little change that i can longer recomend it. Maybe after the fabled engine update comes out (whenver the hell that'll be) that might change. But with the ownership of the game currently under the money milking copany G1, nothing will happen. There hasn't been any change in 6+ years, the haker problem is getting worse, half the weapons are unbalanced, and there are many more issues that make this game hard to enjoy, even with all of the potential it had

4981	0	a	Updates are ruining it, bad tutorial, multipayer is almost dead.
4982	0	a	did i really spend 6 hours doing nothing
4983	0	a	I do not recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game to play and have fun in it, I had to download the files, the install them on the launcher, and after that i had to fix corrupted files and then re install the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, not only that but whenm i finally got into the game i had to make a seemingly useless account so i can play, and once i did everything, made my character, chose a name, and finally picked a server, I got in and had great gameplay, no lag everything loaded fine, i could see the other players and i could see they custom shirts and what not, but i kept on getting kicked from game because of aparent 'slow internet' so when i kept try to play i kept getting kicked, so i really dont think this game is worth it, it looks fun, but it doesnt let you play, good job developers.
4984	0	a	It's a great game, the pewpew action is very satisfying. The sound is absolutely incredible! And i'm always a sucker for games with the level of customization that APB has. However: The hacking is absolutely ridiculous. It takes two shots to kill someone with a sniper rifle, but people will kill you with two bullets from a side arm. Then there's the ability to shoot through walls (not as bad as CS used to be). Many times i will hit the wall I'm hiding behind, with half my body exposed. But other people will have barely a head showing, and waste you.   I try to play bad, so I can go back down in threat, where the hackers are not prominent. But it's tedious. If you can tolerate the hacks, it's a great game. I will unlikely spend money on this until they fix that. I'd uninstal entirely, but my character looks badass.
4985	0	a	Horrible game, New player gets matched with people who are WAY stronger, Game was made out of grenade launchers and snipers, It's not fun being new and playing against people are are 50 times ur rank.
4986	0	a	i use to think this was alright, but now i cant even load up the game
4987	0	a	Doesnt even launch.Best piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on steam.
4988	0	a	Addictive but also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ttingly frustrating at times. Rounds usually aren't very fair.  Probably wouldn't waste my time on it again.
4989	0	a	Created by wallets first. It is purely Pay to Win. You also get matched with people who are a higher threat level than you making it completely unfiar.

I am protecting a case from being stolen and BOOM teammate throw grenade on me  trying to chase enemy and BOOM teammate blocking my way and kill me.  Instead of say sorry they laughing at me.  conclusion; Never play this mothaâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing APB   
4997	0	a	Such a horrible game, Match making is terrible. People with with speed buffs, Regen buffs, Health buffs, get put against new players and people without said buffs and totally wreck them. Gameplay as a whole is unbalanced, seems like almost all FtP games are Pay to win, and that the Devs don't give 2 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s about hackers and security even though they say they do, they actually do not.  You might get lucky and win a game or two, then not win one for like 20 in a row. Or just get players who do nothing, or get put agianst players who purposely go down in rank so they can wreck noobs and lower ranks and get wins easily.  On another note, seems this game has a file integrity problem, and if your unlucky after a while you will never be able to load into the game again. No matter how many times you uninstall and reinstall the game, or repair the game as I've done. I am not even going to bother sending a letter to the Devs as I am sure they will not give a flying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
4998	0	a	The game is so ugly!! How to hack my pc can't get on low damn 30 fps! That FPS drops and lagg!!  To start the game! That is during like 88 hour!! Pay To Play game!!! A lot of bullcrap!! Why are there womans in the game!!! Everybody knows they are smaller en harder to hit in fights!! Cutscnene's, crap!! Loadings screen also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ie girls! People thinking I am watching porn...
4999	0	a	EDIT: After having a second account banned for cheating when I was not cheating, one of which was one I had spent money on, I'm going to have to say that since I have now lost a total ~550 hours of time spent on this game, it was an overall negative experience. Such a shame, it could be so fun if there was more community interaction and the customer support at least TRIED to discuss.  This game is great. Best customization I've ever seen in a game. You can have leggings with a hamburger pattern, or a Strawberry Fish tramp stamp.   Don't ask a Sanctum fan about his dark secrets.    Also, it's just about all free, premium just lets you use more at once. The only beef I really have with the customization is the fact that the minimum boob size isn't really all that small.    Flat chest is justice, small boobs are true.     The driving physics can be really wonky, but really funny. For example, flipping when you clip the ~2 inch elevated curb, or trying to go in circles and clipping a wall, resulting in your car lying on its side.  Your character and Weapons can all have mod slots, which usually have upsides and downsides, so you don't just have a sniper LMG with no downsides.  The combat is pretty fun. Basically you run around like a maniac while holding/spamming LMB and trying to keep your crosshair on the other guy. It's more fun than it sounds, trust me. I also notice almost no latency issues such as you being shot just after going behind cover.  Now, something important to note is that this game WILL make you angry. To properly enjoy it, you have to be able to deal with getting stomped. And stomped again. And again. But after the dust and tears clear, you'll stand up, and find that after hours upon hours of being pounded into the ground, you're now a gold, and beating most of your peers and even a fair few players who outrank you. The stomping doesn't go away forever, and comes back from time to time, and usually when this happens, I get quite worked up, but I just play some other game for a while. It probably helps that I have a bit of a masochistic side to me, but I ALWAYS find myself coming back. It might be a couple hours, it might be a day, it might be a week, once it was even months. I was just playing other games, mostly Planetside 2 and Dota 2, I had decided that G1 was nothing but a money grubbing game killing company that barely moved the development along at all.  Then one day I decided, 'Hey, maybe I'll check out the APB forums. It's not like I have anything better to do.' I don't really have a habit of browsing the forums, but I found a thread that compiled codes for free items and premium. Seeing the headphones code, I realized the immense customization this game had, and thought about how cool it would be to make myself look like Sweet Autumn in-game. Eh, why not? It's not like I'm losing anything by playing a couple rounds. I had put on three days of free premium off the codes thread, and I realized that everything just felt a lot better. In my time away from APB, thanks to Planetside and Dota, my aim and reaction time had greatly improved, and I won A LOT of matches. And on top of that, I was earning a lot more money thanks to the premium. A few days later I realized that between the thread and a couple of events that gave small amounts of G1C, I had amassed enough G1C to buy a Joker Mystery Box. I figured there was nothing else I'd spend the tiny sum of G1C on, so I tried my luck, hoping I'd get crazy luck and get a legendary weapon. I didn't, but I did get 30 days of premium, which was pretty cool.  I sat back and realized, 'Hey, I'm actually having a lot of fun now, especially with all the improved customization thanks to all this free premium.' Since I loved the carbine weapon type so much, I bought the permanent version (Which had like three sales on it at the time) off of the Armas Marketplace.  Then, there was a guy standing near a spawn point at a mailbox. He turned around and shot me. I fired one shot back. He invited me to his group. I figured 'Why not?' Long story short I now have a cool new friend because he shot me.    Whoops, don't try this in real life, kids. People don't take it so kindly.     You know, for a low-down, money grubbing, game-killing company, G1 does a pretty good job.  Also on the joker server there's a guy named KuvoskiStrauss who sprays up lots of well-done pictures of topless/bikini clad animuu girls. Also he sometimes does cool airplane posters. I like airplanes.
5000	0	a	doesn't work, so i reccomend downloading it from the GamersFirst website.
5001	0	a	This is everything wrong with free to play games
5002	0	a	Ugh
5003	0	a	Very unfriendly to new players. Also lot of weaboos.
5004	0	a	I wouldn't force Hitler to play this game.
5005	0	a	When I download the game it just keeps on updating I wate and wate but nothing happends 
5006	0	a	Customization in this game is incredible, sadly hackers have destroyed any will to play. Was one of my favorite shooters.
5007	0	a	Loading simulator 2016. My 1.5 hours was spent either in loading screens or wondering why the game went to a black screen, during a load screen. Never even was able to play the game, when it actually loaded I went to play. Then it crashed
5008	0	a	I'll be honest as I possibly can be with this review in particular.  The game is tough when you start out (ofcourse, because ALL games do), and when you progress on, it becomes easier. I'll say it again, tough when starting out... easier when you keep playing. The only thing that most people dont realize and should. There are also, positive and nevative things to the game (again, all games do), but to be basic, i'll narrow it down to the exact things that are good and bad about this game.  So, whats good is, theres huge customization on just characters alone, as well as symbols and audio, with its own feel for car physics and mechanics that are actually quite interresting and unique.  What is bad, is nothing of the actual game its self, but the people who play it. I wont lie, the majority of guns are quite difficult to handle, which its not that bad if you think about it, just means you need to try... since you cant win anything by doing nothing. But, the majority of people that tend to play this game on a daily basis, end up ruining it for everyone, including themselves. Stupid, is it not? Sadly, these are all of the ones who end up cheating just because they dont bother to play the game, or just do it because they feel powerful and have no actual lives to do anything but ruin things for everyone.  If you can do just one thing, maybe... just maybe, I can truely recommend this game to anyone. That one thing is: Try, without ruining everything, even for other fellow players who desperately attempt to make a good clean day of APB:Reloaded.
5009	0	a	my older brother used to play this game ah back in the good times but eventually i got convinced to trying it immediatly i noticed it has the same frames and 10 minute loading screens from gta only the graphics are from 2006...... i wondered to myself why dont i just play gta but then i noticed the games paytowin right on the announcments theres some small sale on the paytowin â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pretty dumb some reason i have friends that actually enjoy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i dont id rather just play gta now why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ are you reading this review be productive and have positive vibes man

5017	0	a	Great game back in the day but pretty much dead population wise. GTA Online killed what was left when that came out. I'm amazed the servers are still on.
5018	0	a	Just dont waste your time on this game like i did.It's really addictive and incredibly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.P2W ,lots of bugs,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up community and devs who dont give a f. what you have to say.Since the early beta the game is the same nothing new except few guns reskins which u have to pay your real dough for.
5019	0	a	I don't recommend this game for a number of reasons  1. Takes a hour and 1/4 of a hour just to set it up and play the damn game  2. Vey laggy, laggiest game I ever played on Steam  and 3. The loading times, are so damn slow!
5020	0	a	how do i block a game from my viewing
5021	0	a	Your Amd graphics will not work on this game, even if it's a powerful Pc. They only accept Intel, game will stutter and be unplayable in close combat.
5022	0	a	This game si â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ too shooting.
5023	0	a	You see a lot of the cool ads and all of the cool character customizations... when you get into the game all you get is confusion with no tutorial (or I didn't get any) and the game is just bland and boring.
5024	0	a	Spent 40 dollars on this game. Finally hit rank 197 so I can use everything. I was banned 3 days later. For no stated reason. Wrote them a ticket and still no response. Stay away from this game and this company.
5025	0	a	I was banned for literally no reason.
5026	0	a	The game summary: The User that has the best hacks wins.
5027	0	a	I made two new accounts that i have never played on before and my account got suspended because of a terms of service thing. I am over 18 and i accepted the terms of service on both accounts and i saw nothing wrong but as soon as i try to join a district im banned.
5028	0	a	I have been playing this game for a while now, and it was really fun until I join a financial server, then it brings me back to the menu saying my account has been permanently suspended. I'm just happy I didn't spend a single cent on this game.
5029	0	a	Okay I heard this a pretty good game but I cant play it because i figured i needed to download a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of stuff fit=rst then it cant play on windows 10 if they can fix I'll recommend it but for now no stars
5030	0	a	I can't say I actually would recommend this game. That doesn't mean it's not a fun game some of the time, but usally it's honestly pretty bad. You'll get lucky if you find some people who aren't hacking, scum bag trolls or self-procalimed 'pro-players.' The people you'll typically run into are your average scum bags who will constantly tell you how bad you are and that you suck and blah blah blah even though they can't seem to win the match either. BUT when you do find some good people and get in a group, the game can be pretty fun. The customization is very good too, plus there should be an game engine update sometime in 2016 as well.   Edit: Yeah that engine update still hasn't happened.
5031	0	a	TL:DR - You must be a masochist to take this game seriously.  Still a terrible shooter. Somewhat fun for the veterans, just the new pay2win guns make it hard to be enjoyable. Not to mention the hackers. There's an average of one or two per team on Fight Club, at weekends. Don't know about the action districts as I hardly play them, but it's safe to assume they are there as well. It's a game adored by hackers for some reason. G1 should legalize wallhack and everything to level the field.  Grind is less terrible than most F2P games, kinda of goes fast if you are dedicated. But it's hard to raise credits to buy anything, since the payouts for missions or the fight club are next to abysmal. Obviously there to help selling premium subscriptions/premium stuff.  To summarize, you must be a masochist to install this game and keep it, to take it seriously. Believe me, I was one of those maschists that wanted to have everything the game could offer back in 2011.   You may have one or two fun matches, then it's a neverending streak of awful matches that'll probably end up with a broken mouse or worse in a fit of rage. There isn't a friend I met in the game who doesn't have one of those nerd rage stories.
5032	0	a	idfk what is this game...... it seems prety stupid to me
5033	0	a	game isnt actually free to play
5034	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5035	0	a	Game used to be fun. I've been a player since about 2013. Got some ups and down, but it was mostly fun. Today, as I come back to play with my friend and wait for the upcoming halloween event, I get perma banned for 'breaking the terms and service'. How can someone break the rules of the game if they haven't played in 3 months? Really sad as this game was really fun, and they are now banning innocent players for others crimes.
5036	0	a	I like this game quite a lot, which is why I have 258.4 hours in it, but I can't recommend it becuase it uses the worst anti cheat known to man. We mortals merely call it 'punkbuster' this god awful invention is believed to date back to Soviet times where Soviet scientists were thinking what the best way to ruin the western games market was. They decided that the absolutely best way was to make a anti-cheat so horrible that it kicks random people off server, aswell as scan your files when you are not even on the game. So in summary great game but uses anti-cheat developed by the soviets to troll gamers.
5037	0	a	It might say I only have 50 hours, but I mostly played without steam on another account. I played atleast 600 hours of APB in total.  Whatever you do, don't play this game. It's trash, such pay to win. The legendary weapons are way too overpowered and expensive, all the free weapons hardly match up and even if they do, they have been buffed with modifications which p2w weapons already have those. Gamers First doesn't fix any bugs in APB, this is the buggiest multiplayer game I have ever seen. They can't even fix the fighting club bug where it reverts your progress when you reach the gold place.  I kept saying to myself : - This game will get fixed one day, it will become even better.  I was wrong. I actually spent some cash on this game just to get banned 3 months later for.... for.... nothing. My account got a random block out of the blue. I wrote a ticket only to be greeted by a bot which simply stated that my account was banned for 3rd party application use. DOES â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SKYPE COUNT??! NO? THEN HOW IN THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I GOT A PERMA BAN? I am not the first one to be banned for absolutely nothing.   The worst part is that I lost the weapon I bought for over 40$...  The game it self has a great concept, but the company only wants money. Don't even get me started on the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t events they do...  Overall, I don't recommend this game for : Poor customer service, in-game p2w shop, sloopy events, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ server/game maintenance, unfair bans.

5046	0	a	the leaning system is crap beacuse you have to aim in order to lean and it goes into a over the shoulder POV witch is crap i feel like what would make this game better is if it was both 1st and 3rd POV
5047	0	a	Can't even launch the game anymore. Tried every possible fix or workaround. Reinstalled 3 times.
5048	0	a	Has something gta 5 dosent, blinkers. Other than that this game is terrible, stay the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ away.

5051	0	a	This game is pretty bad..!   Matchmaking almost none existant. Open Mics HUD / UI is bad not player friendly. For 16 years old and under ! The cummunity is horrible everyong just trash talks everyone.. Pay to Win --  The only good thing is rich customization of a charecter/Items.  Industrial/Cyberpunk Style game!
5052	0	a	This over all in build is a nice game really cool build and art makeing sytem to it.  But but the biggest problem so over looked is the pay to win if you pay for the over tope guns and then go to the low level zone its eays picking wich kills off new players really unless you have too much money in game and levels also there is no real balnce to the game what so ever.  In the end this game will make you rage quit its a love hate kind of one i hope one day the dev team for APB will think about fixing the problems and working on other elements too.

5061	0	a	This game has people that spend money on items that are either perm or temp. Before their were any hackers but now we got aim hackers and speed hackers everywhere and the anti cheat is just plain garbage. If you dont spend real life money on this game you will not get anywhere unless you get boosted. I get 1 shot by a pistol when my shotgun cant even kill them close range which is what it is meant for. I wouldnt recommend this game if you dont wanna waste money. But if you do then go ahead.

5068	0	a	I did a previous review explaining why this was still a good game and delved into the issues with hackers and defended this company and game full heartedly. I then got false banned for 'hacking' under the new FairFight anticheat system, along with many others.   This was just another slap in the face by the ironically named 'Gamers First' company. Literally no proof is needed to be banned; so play this at your own risk because you are guaranteed to be an ignored, unvalued player.  I suggest that if the same thing has happened to you, consider filing a complaint against them to the BBB, they might still get away with it for now but eventually action will have to be taken. This is not okay and this company is scamming players.
5069	0	a	I cant even get the game to load! the launcher has MANY, MANY problems that need fixing. even when I can get past the launcher the game wont load, so I dont really have any oppinion towards the game/gameplay but this game need alot of help. I also asked a friend how he got the game to work because i saw him playing it, but he replied with 'I havent even gotten it to work, ive just been stuck in the launcher trying to fix it'
5070	0	a	Honestly, this game has gotten pretty good on PC, they are really working to improve the community by banning hackers, and releasing frequent updates on how the game development is going.  However I'm not going to talk about the PC version, I'm going to talk about the Xbone version which seems to be doing terrible as of this moment. I mostly want to talk about false bans but there are other issues I will address here as well.  First the game was super laggy and broken when released, which is to be expected. However it still frequently crashes and lags up pretty hard despite the 'fixes' they have released.  The community is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but that comes with territory.  So I personally don't play the xbone version, I'm pretty loaded on PC and I'd rather not start over. My girlfriend however, plays the game almost religously. The clan she is in is pretty huge in the community, and is well known for elite players who have way too much time on their hands. Recently however a rival clan started PAYING people (he admitted to it, the owner has a recording of it) to mass report members of the clan my girlfriend is in. Pretty much half the clan has gotten false bans at this point, and G1's only response is 'we don't issue false bans' even after posting said proof of false mass reports, they just ignored it. The man in question paying his clannies to false report, is sitting back, laughing, and bragging in social about how he's gotten an entire clan banned, and G1 STILL refuses to do anything about it.  This is beyond pathetic, some of these players have already put quite a bit of money into the game. So why would it bennefit them to mod their xbone, and hack in APB? Also why haven't they been console locked for modding console and 'detected' hacks yet?   Exactly, because there was no wrong-doings on the part of said clan, except they were rivals with another huge clan that just wanted them out of the picture, and G1 doesn't give a single â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about what goes on in the community, only what they feel is right and wrong will be addressed.  SOOOOO, until they decide to start giving a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the xbone, which a lot of players have now moved to, or started playing. I'm not putting another â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing penny into this game.
5071	0	a	When I heard about this game I was ecstatic. It was much before GTAV got out with online mode. I saw myself as a veteran criminal turning the whole city into a battlezone, making my money from extorsion to laundering and why not trafficking. HOW DISAPOINTED WAS I. People are WAY TOO FAST, getting a sniper shot in the head doesn't kill most of the time, and if you want to be decent, get your credit card out. Also, if you are a criminal, you can mug people on the street, it should get you far enough to buy a kitkat bar and some sweets. You can also try to ram a shop display to grab everything in it, you should end up with MUCH MORE, like, enough cash to buy yourself a new scarf. If you are a cop tho, ho ho ho, you are in for some pain. You get money from missions only. So if nobody is playing criminal on your server, you are bound to be a poor officer without enough cash to start your alcohol addiction untill the rest of your life. Even tho, you got cash, what next? Buy yourself a weapon, keep it 30 days and give it back. BUT YOU CAN CUSTOM YOUR CAR AND IF YOU ARE SKILLED ENOUGH YOU COULD MAKE PINGU ON THE SIDE OF YOUR CAR AND START THE NOOT NOOT PATROL. So yeah, if you want to stay alive, keep sprinting in ALL DIRECTIONS and hope for the dude to not have a VERY GOOD AIM.
5072	0	a	This game is getting dead faster and faster. perfect, but its your bad, devs, you dont give a single one about the community. only the new thing you release is an update with a car that can only be bought with some p2w cash? really? this is just fun  APB 2010 - 8/10 was fun APB:Reloaded - 0/10 just awful  Let me just put this into a small review of APB:Reloaded  This game community is absolute garbage, it is the most pay2win game I ever seen, devs dont give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the game, matchmaking is the worst, worse than cod, bad performance, if you have wealthy mum with some huge â™¥â™¥â™¥ money filled credit card, play this game.  if you dont... please, dont even install this game and just give it a 'No' at your review. this garbage doesnt belong on steam.
5073	0	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ don't play it
5074	0	a	This game is unbalanced as f*ck!
5075	0	a	Guys, im sorry to give this a bad review. But there are alot of bugs and things that i just hate in this game.     Ok so first off, i have played this since i was 6 and i loved it. That was when i was 6. i got back into it at 11. (my age right now). Im going to list alot of topics in this.     Aiming  So i have alot to say about aiming. I think its unique but stupid too. When i am aiming at a person i have to press v to switch sides. and this is my personal recomendation but i prefer when its in the middle of the screen.I cant hit them with anything because of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t aiming even at point blank because any mouse sensitivity doesnt work, even with a damn shotgun. Also i cant even see my shoes when looking at my character, except when im looking down. Next topic.      Radar  Ok this is not as important but you should still read it. When i am trying to kill someone, it doesnt show them on my radar, unless they are in plain sight, also it mostly all of the time, shows people below you. Which i think is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in stupid. Also it doesnt show them when they are 'hiding'. i put that in quotes because that mechanic is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Next topic.      Grenades and Splash Damage  Ok when a vehicle is near me and explodes it should kill me. Even with perks. Also grenades, without perks.      Loading  Ok the loading is way to long, if they could fix that it would be nice.      G1C  You get a ripoff of G1C when you pay. if they could increase the amount of G1C that you get it would also be nice.
5076	0	a	It's a fun game however lacks updates and fixes. The map becomes boring after a few hours of playing, and is certainly pay to win.
5077	0	a	This game makes me want to kill myself!
5078	0	a	This game is not fun. The customization is amazing, but that is the only good quality about this game. The driving is the worst I've ever seen, the combat is ridiculously annoying, and the overall feel of the game is crap. It's fun to force loser pedestrians to give you their money, but the animation is always the same, and it gets old fast.  While you are mugging the 30th half naked white girl, you will pray for a idiot to run her over in a car.   I give it a 10/10 'cause I'm an idiot.
5079	0	a	The game USE to be good and full of players a lot like how Payday is. However its no longer the case and the game is dead with really no players and horrible layout. Theres no HUD or mini map, I did like how there was no real story to the game however without any story you don't know the point. I will say this game beats Half Life in terms of ragdoll effect I wish they added cross hairs.

5086	0	a	This Game is completly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up Technicaly; there are a lot of Incohenreces with the objectives wich makes you lower your win/loss ratio wich determines your Level(And the more you loose for no reason, the more it'll be hard to progress since the ratio will change each time more slower). There are huges leaks of Memory wich makes your RAM overflow, if you aint got 4Gb ram minimum you'll crash every 5 hours of continuous playing, The Hitboxes are 9 times larger than the character and the perpetual lags makes you die with the least powerfull weapon.Furthermore the actual developers(not the originals) are just using this game to get money so dont expect anything to be solved.  MEANWHILE, The Concept of this game is so awesome that even if you rage every 10 minutes you WANT to play such a cool game; In other Word the player's possibilities are Infinite, you're able to do quite everything, it would just need some stunts like dashing or rolling on sides.  Concept=1337/10 Development=-666/10
5087	0	a	it was crap because in the costomise player i couldnt accept to next stage because it filled my monitor right up and couldnt change it in game because i couldnt pass the stage so would be good i could pass it aye
5088	0	a	They have a good idea but poor design its a little laggy and it gives trouble when trying to open up i think if it gets more work done to it it could be great but as is gonna give it a 3/10
5089	0	a	It's like Crackdown and GTA if they both sucked
5090	0	a	p2w, one of the worst communities ever. would not recommend.
5091	0	a	A game with great potential ruined by a negligent company and microtransactions. Very addictive, I caved into the microtransactions hard, but eventual realized the endless pit I was throwing money into and decided to stop playing entirely. Not worth anyone's time.
5092	0	a	I dont know how much time I put into this game some reason it isnt even in my steam library anymore. I had fun while I played the game but it got repetitive very quickly. There werent a lot of people playing it a few years ago I imagine the amount is a lot less now.
5093	0	a	Im pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that the game could not properly install or run. I've been at it for a few hours now troubleshooting endlessly.  1. I had problems with the launcher installing Visual C++ 2005, 2010, etc. 2. Every time i launch it says installing Direct X, making no progress as far as i can tell. I checked my task manager and could see the Direct X installer doing its thing. Yet every time i launch it tries to install Direct X again. 3. I recieved an error that said something about it not installing properly. I changed the properties for the launcher so that it ran as administrator, hoping it would fix the problem, alas no progress.  Im pretty dissapointed, I was excited to play the game, and still am but this is frustrating.
5094	0	a	Updated Review 2016 - The bloom in this game is awful, picture this...fingerprints all over your phone screen and then smudged. That is what you can expect to see while playing this game. Now once you get past the dated graphics the actual core of the game is fun..provided you don't mind PVP. Tons of customization options to your character and your items. Sadly the Armas Market (real currency required to purchase vehicle body kits, guns, weapon skins etc..) is very pricey. The real bad part is the insane amount of cheaters since this is a free to play game...you can expect to come across them daily and just about every other match. The anti cheat detection system is fairfight and some in-house countermeasures....all of which puts its fair share of catching and banning them on a daily basis. SO dated graphics, gnarly amount of cheaters, expensive market place...and a toxic community are what you can expect here..oh and I shouldn't forget this game's developer has an uncanny knack for UNBANNING hackers/cheaters which really should deter you from investing any amount of time and money into this game.    Old Review 2014 - The most expensive FREE to Play ingame items.
5095	0	a	What got me to try it was its intricate customization system but, sadly, it wasn't fully accessible without having a Premium account. Along with my other disappointments is that the game is Pay-to-Win, meaning that new players can just buy off stronger items (with real-world cash) than to work hard for them. I don't recommend this unless you have a stack of money to burn.
5096	0	a	this game suck
5097	0	a	I've saw other people saying this is a bad game, I bet it is, but I'll just try it. That is why I got an extra bit of ram to play this game for my birthday.
5098	0	a	nothing changes...poor graphics and servers lagging like hell ,, but i've good memories with this game :/ was fun but i don't play it anymore :/.
5099	0	a	.
5100	0	a	I've wasted too much money on this game. Don't consider downloading it, even if it's free. It's completely pay to win, bad engine, bad service, bad company everything is bad, except the customization.

5110	0	a	This over all in build is a nice game really cool build and art makeing sytem to it.  But but the biggest problem so over looked is the pay to win if you pay for the over tope guns and then go to the low level zone its eays picking wich kills off new players really unless you have too much money in game and levels also there is no real balnce to the game what so ever.  In the end this game will make you rage quit its a love hate kind of one i hope one day the dev team for APB will think about fixing the problems and working on other elements too.
7493	1	a	I think this game will appeal to you if you are a certain kind of person. Do you like Firefly or Mad Max? Does the post disaster/apocalyptic setting appeal? Do you like melancholy, moody music? Do you tend to like more serious 'grown up' games that allow true role playing? Are you happy to wander around on your own, sometimes for long stretches of time, without seeing a soul? Are you more of a loner (a strange question for an MMO perhaps)? Are you more of a calm person who takes gaming slowly rather than rushing to experience a game in the shortest possible time? If the answer is mostly yes this game could be for you...  For me, the atmosphere in this game is second to none. Fantastic music, incredible view distance that really hammers home the immense size of the game (around 1000 square kilometres I believe - to put that into perspective Skyrim is around 40 I think) and true freedom to go pretty much wherever you want right from the very start of the game. Note though that I play as a single player - I'm not a clan type of person - so I can't really tell you much about the social side of the game. It is fairly quiet of late - not too many players - but that suits me fine.  It's certainly not a polished experience but then, if you're anything like me, that won't matter in the slightest. There's plenty of minor bugs although hardly any will stop progress (a simple relog usually sorts out most things) and there are plenty of minor gameplay things to moan about but, overall, the game is very unique and well worth the download. A huge thing in its favour is that it's a true free to play game. You can play the entire game without spending any real world money. Real world money will get you cool items to wear, cool vehicles, nice buffs and such but almost all of it can also be purchased with in game earned currency if you are patient and keep an eye on the auction house for bargains. It's also worth noting that a lot of the coolest, unique weapons and clothing items can only be earned through questing.  I'm not going to go too heavily into the mechanics of the game - it's pretty standard MMO levelling and crafting (but a very deep and rewarding crafting system) and such but it is one of the very few MMO's with real time skill based combat - think first person shooter - and the whole experience of the game is very 'manual' - nothing's on auto pilot - it's all on you to use your skill to stay alive basically.  Right, I think I've talked enough now...
7495	1	a	For those of you looking for a fallout-ish experience, you wonâ€™t find it here For the very few people who actually read this review, Iâ€™m going to start off with everything bad that it does. 1) The community feels as dead as all the enemies I had to kill to complete one objective 2) The game does nothing new, it is very generic and copy-paste of other games in the genre.  The purpose of a game like this is to do what similar games of its genre did and build on those ideas and make them better. Not fabricate what already exists and slap a â€œdoneâ€ sticker on the front. I want something new, with a quirk or unique feature, not a copy paste.  3) There is very little explanation about how skills, items and game mechanics work, only basic key mapping like moving, turning and combat. 4) The story is fairly mild at best 5) Melee combat is dull and unsatisfying 6) Quests have a tendency to â€œbug outâ€ or have confusing objectives, one situation was where I needed to go to a point on the map, let an NPC follow me and walk back to the start point. Apart from I failed the quest somehow on the first try, the game never explained how or why.  When I went back there the NPC that was meant to follow me no longer appears, and as such I have no idea how to complete the quest. Other situations like questing disappearing from my menu also happen frequently, meaning quests I was halfway through needed to be picked up again from a guy quite literally 3 miles away and completed in one go.  7) Menus are very clunky, from the start I was bombarded by a bunch of skills I didnâ€™t know (and still donâ€™t know) the effects or uses of. 8) The crafting system does nothing new, by which I mean it's all dull bashing objects togeather to make something out of thin air. It's also crafted in real time, which can sometimes be up to half an hour for some items. Maybe more. 9) How skills work is never explained, you have to figure it out via tooltips. 10) For me this game took over 50 minutes to download, unpack and patch before I could play. This was on a 100 mbp/s connection with no bottlenecks and commonly downloads big budget triple A games in under 30 mins. 11) I have no idea how they got the screenshots on the store page, I push everything to max and it still looks like something a commodore 64 would play. 12) Fallen Earth tries way to hard to be funny. Often forcing vulgar 12 year old humour at every turn.   So what is good about it?
7497	1	a	Alright. This may as well be a rant but I'm going to break this review down on some subcategories. I've been playing this game for a while and recommend it to new people. HOWEVER, for people playing the Alpha and Beta like I had, GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR CHARACTER BACK. G1 basically said 'screw you' to me and I haven't even been able to access my character from maybe...3-6 months ago? Not even? TERRIBLE.  CATEGORY 1: Graphics Now the graphics AREN'T FALLOUT LEVEL. They're about average MMORPG...Like ArcheAge or TERA. Yes, you can set your graphics really high and I get about 50-60 frames on Highest, and when I lower about 110-120 FPS. They can use some work, but I noticed if you turn your graphics down even slightly, you loose A LOT of really nice detail that they put in there for fine polishing.  CATEGORY 2: Gameplay (Combat, Movement, PvP, PvE) Gameplay is...it's...it's alright. The combat is either 1st or 3rd person; and personally I would rather go 3rd. 1st person is extremely wierd and awkward, and rather dull as well. Now, as for movement- THE MAPS...IN THIS GAME...ARE SO FREAKING HUGE. I SWEAR. TO GOD. They split them up into 'Sectors,' and the last being 'Alpha County' which is basically the end game area. Now, that being said, you can ATTEMPT to run there. However, I tried to get from Sector 1 to Sector 2, and didn't pack enough feed for my horse. I was left STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE with a horse that eventually DIED on me (No it didn't literally, but it may as well have with the speed it was going). So, if you're going between Sectors, be sure to grab a mount. But what I would LOVE to commend G1 for doing here is I have never...NEVER...IN MY LIFE..EXPERIENCED A LOADING SCREEN TRAVELLING. Only will you ever for teleporting and loading INTO the game. Travelling is loading-screen free, along with dungeons as well.  -Mounts in the game are very nice to have and can be pricey at times, but they're well worth the buy. You have two types of mounts, machines and natural. Natural covers things like horses and some kick-â™¥â™¥â™¥ massive wolves you can ride on. And no they aren't your stereotypical wimpy â™¥â™¥â™¥ wolves. These things are H-U-G-E and well worth getting in the quest line that you complete to get them (yes, you can actually get mounts through questlines; GOOD ONES not just starter ones). Machines covers ATV's, Bikes, Buggies, and Cars. But, the higher tier you get on mounts, THEY ARE GOD-AWFUL TO TAKE CARE OF. Be ready to spend some in-game cash to take care of them, 'cause some use 'premium' fuel.  -PvP in the game is fairly decent, involving some ethics of 'skill' and dodging. However, if you want PvP, it is HORRIBLY balanced. Rifleman and snipers are left in the dark, along with some longer range classes while melee is the way to go. Oh, and you think carrying a massive club around is going to get you where you want? HELL NO. Yeah, you have the OCCASIONAL good heavy melee weapon that can get the job done; but no, you'll be faced with a load of VERY....VERY...VERY fast DPS melee weapons that literally shred you. So for PvP, get some very fast dual pistols or duel machetes/knives.  -PvE/Questing is nice in the game and is pretty alright. However, questing can get..repetitive. 'RUN HERE, SHOOT THIS, RUN BACK, TURN IT IN. DONE.' Now, there are the exceptional quests that do have you doing some pretty cool things such as setting explosives on a vehicle or hunting down massive bosses. And the bosses in this game are VERY...VERY hard to beat without a group. Other than that...Not really much else for questing. I commonly found myself GRINDING THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of high level enemies just to rank up. Took me HOURS and loads of cash for ammunition.   CATEGORY 3: Community The community is alright, but nothing different from any other MMO community out there. You're going to have those OBVIOUS dickwads and terrible people. Hell, you will even FIGHT...LITERALLY FIGHT over loot sometimes. Seriously...fk that. Even then, on GLOBAL channels people are being harassed. I had to step in once and tell someone to back off, which then lead to me reporting these asshats to the online GM (Game Moderator). Their accounts were issued a warning. Don't hope for the best from this community, 'cause you ain't gon'na receive â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Now....now comes the Pay-to-Play/Pay-to-Win. N-O. All things you will get to buff up your character is IN GAME. The only thing in this 'cash shop' is going to be cosmetics and SOME boosts such as EXP. Overall, a fun game, good setting, terribad community, decent cash shop. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ TRAVELLING BY FOOT. IN. THE. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  EDIT: Funny Things in the game &gt;Running around in a speedo with a gasmask on. &gt;Crafting horses. With Kits. That's right. There's a kit to craft a horse. Oh and one more thing, this game, as it is made by Gamers First, MAY NOT WORK ON SOME PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS. I don't know what is wrong with it but sometimes these games just don't want to work.
7499	1	a	How to do a review for a game that you spent over 3000 hours playing? Could it be objective? Hardly. But i will try at my best to keep it real as much as it is possible. First off, this game is not old. Its ancient.  Graphics  are, by todays standards, in world that saw titles such as Crysis, CoD:AW, Battlefield or Witcher series, laughable at best. It looks old, it ''plays'' old, but it has some of its charm for it.  Story ? Interesting, starting parts are very cohesive, but later on its starts to be very watered down.  Gameplay ? That depends solely on player. There are multiple things you could do ingame (crafting, pvp, pve, farming, exploring, ect), and it works well on its part, but some features definately need to be worked on. I could spend hours explaining each part separately, but generally, game has complex crafting system, pve is fun as far pve goes in other games (there are bosses, instances, dungeons, team raids, ect), farming and harvesting are nice way of getting materials in large quantities if you dont mind posibility of being attacked while doing so (depending on place where you farm/harvest). Over the course of playing i met lot of interesting people. Some were nice, some were not, but all around, Fallen Earth has (or had) one of best comunities around in MMO's. There is always someone who will help out new player, give some usefull advice, share money, resources or items. There are also individuals who organise various community events. One of biggest problems most post apocalyptic games have is that they are constantly being measured towards Fallout universe games. That is a problem, since most games do not measure up to Fallout. Fallen Earth is one of games that comes very, very close to that. Not the same, but not too much diferent from it. Each of those games has its own pros and cons. Sadly, at current time, it seems that G1 (company who owns FE) isnt too much interested in adding new things (although they do occasionally, but not to extent from before), but we always hope they will come to their senses and finish polishing the diamont that Fallen Earth is, and make it shine as it should.
5112	0	a	World is not interesting, enemies are not interesting, dungeons are boring with bullet sponge bosses. The end game pvp is borderline pay2win with the way the shop works. The combat is aim/action based but still uses spammy hotkey skills. Overall the combat is worse than WoWs style due to how horrible the animation and unbalanced the skills are. The crafting takes a long time to do unless you pump money into the game. You can straight up buy the best vehicle in the game, and you have to buy a item to craft the best weapons. This is not fallout the mmo, this is a sad attempt to milk fallout fans.  I have a lot of time in it from pressure by friends to play it. Same reason WoW still has so many subs who don't actually like the game much, they play it as a social experience. Also have a lot of time simply from being AFK. The best way to level is waiting in a place called Citadel. Also crafting is only viable if you AFK in game next to a bought crafting table.
5113	0	a	I was part of the beta testing for this game and played it up until the game went free to play and got sold to that third company, Gamers First.  When the game was handed over to that company I lost access to my old account and the characters on it. I followed the instructions to 'merge' my account to their new system and lost access in the process, I contacted them and received no response on the issue.  I tried making another account but found the game was being filled with microtransaction pay to win garbage so I just dumped the game.  The old Devs were actually active within the community, and very helpful.  The new Devs, in my short one sided interaction with them, are complete garbage.  This game had a lot of promise to it but was snuffed out by the new company's greed and lack of customer service.  This game is dead.
5114	0	a	This game is dead. You can try it, but DO NOT spend money on it.  Bottom line, AbandonWare.
5115	0	a	I played this game early on, ran a very popular clan, and loved PVP. Gamersfirst destroyed Fallenearth. In 3 years, they have made 4 new weapons. No new levels, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ exspansion areas. This was one of the best games I ever played, but G1, destroyed the whole game. Don't let my hours through steam fool you, I played way before steam launch. The PvP used the be the best I could find anywhere, but now it is so plagued with aim botters, and all the PvP builds are cookie cutter builds. I made a build from my own preference, a low heals high damage fighter, and it worked, so what happens, they nerfed it till I couldn't use it anymore. Building a character for PvP through your rp mindset doesn't work. The PvP is down to a variety of six weapons, and four reskinned sets of armor. The developers of this game, take all the money from it, and dump it into other games. It was one of the best MMOs I ever played, and it will not be forgotten, but as it stands I will never play again .
5116	0	a	Not worth the install in my opinion. When you look at this you think 'COOL! AN MMORPG JUST LIKE FALLOUT!' What you get: Hard to follow missions with rude players who are really into it just to troll the ***k out of you continuously until you either quit playing or get good enough to beat them to death in return.
5117	0	a	Downloaded enormous game file. This took an entire day.  Created account.  Read EULA. Standard stuff.  Read SECOND EULA. Code of conduct and a few weird roleplay related rules. Mental note to stay away from those servers.  Downloaded five hundred updates. Another day is now nearly over.  Loading screen / ad.  Create character.  Loading screen / ad.  Finally get to make my first gameplay related keystrokes.  Game freezes after 4 seconds of play.  Wait.  Game resumes.  Punch small man.  Small man yells at me.  Game freezes.  Wait.  Game crashes.  Uninstall.  Moral: you get what you pay for.
5118	0	a	don't do it. its a good game and i've loved it for years however the past 6 months it's died and there's not much point in anyone playing. there are bugs which damage the game greatly and have been known about for years - but never fixed.  The GM's / devs put very little time or effort into the game anymore and it's barely supported by them. The game has a crash or a downtime every day, but still the cash shop sales are pumped out. I feel they are just milking it for as much money as they can, when it's no longer worth anyones time - let alone cash.
7501	1	a	For SOME reason, my old and well viewed review for this game got removed and now i'll have to repost it:   OH MY GOD, how could i have played this crap for more than 170hours?   It seems like some people wanted Fallout New Vegas to be a MMORPG. And here it is. Well, one thing is for sure, it can be addictive if you like power play. It's art style is obviously some post apocaliptic stuff, wich looks not that bad itself. But seriously. this game is out since 2011 but yet it's full of gliches ,unfinnished animations and messed up or even missing sound files.That ruins the atmosphere.  But the thing that kept me playing for so long was the gameplay. First you start off with PAINTBALL GUNS AND SELF MADE SHIVES while rinding A FUKKING HORSE!. But then, you see some heavily armored guys with cool Gas-Masks and badass looking rifles, revolvers, and machetes while driving a dune buggy or a pocket bike(love em).  So.what does a power player think? 'I WANT THAT SH/T RIGHT NOW!' Then you realize how fast you can get EXP by just exploring and killing mobs wich acctaly makes really fun. (atleast at the lower levels.) Of course finnishing quests gives you WAY more exp than just killing stuff.But the thing is, most of the quests are not as repetitive as in the most MMORPGS.Well...not all of them are...let's say 50% of the quests you can get are repetitive.But that's something everybody who likes MMORPG's has to deal with.  Another thing is the crafting system.You can craft gear and equipment wich you could get from merchants and quest rewards 5-10 levels later.This includes....C@RZ!!!!!!!!!.you can craft your own ATV (wich is some sort of quad-bike) really early in game...if you do the right quest line.  The AI is....well...not that good acctualy.If an enemy detects you in it's view (wich is 360Â°...) it will follow you untill it's close enough to attack. If you run away from it it might give up the pursuit after like 8seconds.Usual stuff.  BUT it's the way they follow you....you can't hide from then.THEY CAN TELEPORT!  Example: I was in a house sniping out of a window. I shot some ugly a$$ mutant who was standing outsite and doing...well nothing.I shot him and took about 20% of his health.Then i wanted to swich to my shotgun and wait for him to get into the house so i can shoot him from upstairs.but while i was swiching weapons: GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR. It was RIGHT INFRONT OF MY FACE.So yeah, teleportation.This sucks.  But i must say this game got a LOAD of different enemies from Aligators to Zombies(and humans of course).Seriously a sh/t load. But sometimes....i though to myself 'why in a game like this?' Im talking about animals....NORMAL A$$ ANIMALS like bears, pumas, wild dogs, rhinos,snakes,Zebras etc. It seems like they ran out of ideas and started taking models from zoo tycoon.  ANYWAY. This game if great if you are only about the essence of a MMORPG since it's full with content and customizable player skills. If you care about visual stuff like graphics, visual gliches and overall atmosphere then....GTFO-------&gt;  I'm not sure whether to recommend this game for everybody or not. If you're someone who likes MMORPGs, then go download it.  Um...yeah...that review is way too long and like 2 people are going to read it anyway.k thx bye  (Sorry if there is any wrong grammar, english is not my native language.)
5120	0	a	This was a tough one to recommend or not, but I'm going to have to go with no. I wanted to say yes, and I would have, only if the Devs paid more attention to newer people who play the game for the very first time. I will first start off with a Pros/Cons list  Pros:  Decent Graphics HUGE map Good combat (not just point in click, you actually have to aim and shoot) Factions is a neat idea ontop of clans PvP is for the most part, actually about skill Lots of things to do at max level  Cons:  HUGE map, but not much in it Melee is SO overpowered Can't trust faction members, you have half chance of them betraying you Not nearly enough support at lower levels (will explain later) Rude community GM's don't do much Horrible customer support (will explain later)  Now, when I say 'Not nearly enough support at lower levels' I mean that there has been so many updates in the game to keep higher level'd people to keep playing, example, the G.O.R.E. update (that whole update was a mess), while there's no updates or anything for lower level'd people, the game has a decent tutorial system, but just like anything, a tutorial can only help so much, you actually need to do it to get better. If you want to craft, you need to scavenege in PvP areas for certain things and people usually just camp there waiting for people to show up to get stuff to craft and waste them before they even know what happens. The economy is pretty messed up, ammo, which costs nothing to make really, is sold for a pretty pricey amount, I understand supply and demand but holy crap, it's hard to get money as a lower level so ammo isn't going to be cheap for them.  Customer support... It literally means 'customer support' if you're a f2p, they don't give a flying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about you, (it's kind of like TF2, if you buy a single item from the online store, you unlock things, such as no money limit and all that), in fact, unless you bought something or have a subscription, you can't even file a ticket! Even people who are paying a montly fee for the game, they barely care about you. GM's hardly do anything to help you, but they do throw bans left and right on a power hungry trip. The community is rude, 80% of the people there are the ones who have still played when the game is P2P so they thing they're better than everyone in general.  As for factions, there are Techs, Travelers, Light Bearers, Enforcers, CHOTA and I forget what the last one is called, they're kind of like hippies, anyways, each one has a natural ally and a natural enemey, Techs hate the hippies, but Techs are allied with Travelers, but Travelers hate Light Bearers, etc etc, but unfourtantely none of that matters since if you if you're a Traveler, you'll get freaking shot up by another Traveler, otherwise the whole faction thing would be an awesome idea.  I really liked the game at first, but it kept going downhill, the last thing I will say is the G.O.R.E. update, it released new weapons, a rifle, pistol and sword. Each one of those weapons were able to be upgraded 2 times, so it'd be rifle, upgraded rifle, upgraded upgraded rifle, but of course, each upgrade was harder to do, and the most upgraded rifle, could easily one hit kill someone, the DPS on the pistols (which shot in three burst (now fixed)) was insanely high, and well, for the sword, all melee is over powered so you get the idea on that. Some people made a clan to nerf the guns, some people made a clan to get rid of the update and killed anyone (the clan was always in a zerg) using the weapons, whether they were in the same faction or not. And then there was a clan that said to keep the update as is, and of course, they were using the Level 3 weapons. So they finally nerfed the weapons after about a month or so. Some people are wondering things like 'Why is he even saying this?' Well, I'm saying this because if the Devs released an update that had insanely OP weapons without even thinking about if it's OP, or to test it or anything really, It really makes me not being able to trust them with future content, and also, the only reason the nerfed it, is because people were canceling their subscriptions until they nerfed it  Edit: Typos and added a statement in the 'Customer Support' part
7503	1	a	How the f*** did I craft a horse?!
7505	1	a	The 3 day install was my favorite part.
7507	1	a	Over all a pretty good game , but FE has it's share of issues as I'll discuss below.    Story:   There isn't one. There is a bare bones backstory to the different factions, what they're about, and what they offer....but that's about it. There's also general story lines in each settlement along with a ton of sidequests, but they do little to establish any kind of narrative.    Gameplay:   FE works like a 3rd person shooter combined with WoW. You have to aim your own weapons (more on this in the PVP section) and there are a number of abilities you can activate during combat to give yourself an edge. This part of the game is done pretty well, combat is intuitive and if you pay attention to the tutorial, fairly easy to pick up.   The crafting system in this game is fantastic, almost every material needed to craft everything you could ever want can be salvaged from the world, harvested at player created farms, collected by player made harvesters in PVP zones, or purchaced off the Auction House.     Graphics:   This wasn't that big of a deal to me since I don't get hung up on graphics much, but this game was developed in 2009 and the graphics look pretty dated.     Player population:   I don't get alot of the complaints about this as at no point were any of the sector hubs empty. As a crafter I had no trouble making money off the Auction House as there were plenty of buyers for most of my products (once I figured out how to price them properly). You probably won't be tripping over other players when you're out in the middle of nowhere on missions, but is that a bad thing?    F2p or pay to win?   FE is good about this aspect as well. There is a cash shop where you can buy boosts to things like experience and faction point award rates; but there's no explicit thing you can buy in the cash store that will give you any advantage against an equally skilled and leveled player whom has never bought anything from the cash shop. The items you pay real money for are largely cosmetic or purely for convinence.     PVP:   This is by far the most mixed aspect of Fallen Earth. FE does reward pvp kills against different factions with a pvp currency, but in a move I haven't seen in any other MMO (except EVE), FE adds a reason to fight in PVP zones other than pvp currency, Harvesters. Harvesters are player created structures that generate crafting resources that hard to impossible to find outside PVP zones, and as you can guess can only be placed in PVP zones. When all goes well PVP is fun &amp; rewarding, regardless if your faction holds the conflict town at the end of the day.  So what's wrong you ask? First off you're not likely to get a real taste of PVP untill you're close to level cap, granted if you hang around the level 20-45 conflict towns you might bump into an enemy faction; but if you do it's likely to be a clan blob of 5-10 people leveling their alts &amp; steamrolling anyone in their path. The reason the lower level zones are so empty? The level debuff, which cripples anyone above a given conflict town's level range. The idea isn't a bad one: to keep tweaked out lvl 55s from curb stomping fledgling pvp players. But instead of bringing them on the level of people supposed to be in that zone it effectively renders the higher level player helpless; as a result nobody goes near conflict zones if there's even a chance they'll get hit with the level debuff.  But the absolute worst part is the proliferation of hackers (aimbotters and the like) in pvp. G1 does a pretty inconsistent job of keeping hackers in check; every once in a while they do a purge of hackers and PVP becomes fun again, but they always seem to come back. 90% percent of the challenge in pvp is consistently hitting your opponent, preferably with headshots which do considerably more damage, getting good at hitting and avoiding being hit is the core of PVP. So you can see how the fun gets quickly sucked out of this critical part of the game when you have ENTIRE CLANS able to sweep whole PVP zones simply by activating a 3rd party hack and racking up 100% accuracy while their opponents have no recourse what so ever. The fact G1 has been unable or unwilling to find a long term solution to this problem is by far FE's biggest problem.    Summary:   Fallen Earth is f2p game that isn't pay to win; that alone makes it worth a try. But digging deeper this game has plenty to offer in terms of PVE, crafting, and (if the hacker population is culled at the time) end game PVP. It's really up to what you value in an MMO if FE is worth your time; it certianly is for me despite it's faults.
7509	1	a	You may have heard this game is buggy. That is an understatment. You may have heard this game is full of chat and PvP trolls. Well I am not going to argue against that. The things is I would not normally tolerate that from a game. It is unacceptable.  The game however is in a league of its own. I cannot take my business elsewhere. There is no Elsewhere. Fallen Earth is an MMORPG that does not always look the prettiest but actually provides you with a massive world where there is a point to going off exploring. Resources are everywhere. Everything is needed in someway and almost everything has to be crafted by players.  Character development is very customizable both in terms of appearance and performance. All clones are created equal but some are developed poorly. It is an easy system to learn, but much tweaking availiable when mastered. Fallen Earth really is the MMO you can play your way. Every clone can find a niche. Fallen Earth is not at all P2W, with the only advantages being convenience and cosmetics for cashers. Even a subscription can be bought with in game currency. The community has many helpful players and questions are answered quickly via the help channel. If you start playing use the help channel. The game is quite simple to learn but not very well explained by the game itself. Stick with it. Each in-game sector brings fun and different game mechanics. Do not be in a hurry in this game. Speed levelling when you don't know much is a very bad idea.
5121	0	a	I couldn't recommended this game to anyone. I've played it for years and now with the declining player base and lack of care from the company that owns it, the game has less than 200 players at peak times. This leads to an inbalanced system of older players having everything and newer players struggling to get what they need at lvl55.   There are no updates anymore. Events have become non existant and if you need GM help forget it. There is very little oversight from G1. The game is being left to decay. Lag has become a real issue and over the months it has not improved. If anything it has gotten worse.  When I first started playing FE it was great. Lots of players. events, GMs on daily. Any issues were sorted out in a timely manner. It was a very fun game to play. Now it is very different, which is a shame as there seems to be no other game like it.  If you are into PVP forget it. It is dead. Only PVE remains with the very occassional PVPer online.  In my opinion Fallen Earth isn't worth the download anymore.
5122	0	a	I used to play this game very frequently and would again if one could purchase crafting queue slots.  Since the addition of the patch 2.4 the style of gameplay has changed. Please be aware that this game is only marginally F2P like WoW, you need a subscription to properly play.  A year on from this review and my opinion has softened, but if you want to play this game without micromanagment and a large sink of your time it will be hard to do so without a subscription. Bearing this in mind, I wait with baited breath for an expansion good enough to lure me back in or some way to permanently expand my crafting ability.

5123	0	a	I love Fallen Earth! So many great memories in this game. I downloaded it in 2012 and deeply regret that I missed its early days. I still play it pretty regularly, but I can't willingly recommend it.   The player base is dwindling due to lack of advertising, non-existent updates, and what seems like complete abandonment from GMs/Devs. Every anniversary that I have in memory was met with a celebration for making another great year! And if you were subscribed you would receive an article of clothing with the game's name, usually. This year, (marking Fallen Earth's seventh) there were only three redeem codes to celebrate it. Just depressing.  I unfortunately can't see a future for this game, if this continues. Recommending Fallen Earth is just letting gamers waste time, effort, and money for a game on its last leg. It pains me to write this because I don't want this game to end, but have no power to change its fate.
5124	0	a	I quit playing this game when I found out that the 'Devs' were also the same people who were Hackers, who Hacked the game and used their cheats to ruin the game for other people.  There is no customer Support system.  You can send a 'Report' to the company, but, the same people who are the game 'Devs' will recieve it, reject your complaint, and then ask you to shell out more money for a Premium account.  This game was a complete waste of time, and some money.  The only good thing I found in this game was a Clan/Guild, that soon left the game due to Hackers, and the Devs that don't do anything about the Hackers, because they themselves are Hackers, and enjoy tormenting people in PvP with Invulnerable Characters, an are extremely abusive toward the Players. 
7513	1	a	This game is one of the best F2P games I have ever played, and the biggest F2P game I have ever played.  +The game world is huge. It spans over sectors and the overall map is bigger then triple A titles such as GTA V and Just Cause 2.  +Character customisation. When you start the game you have the ability to change the appearance of your character, and during the game you can equip things that can add benefits and features, like dusters or combat suits.  +Clans and teams. In game there is a team system that people can join into so that you can complete a mission together, and some missions require that. The team system also allows voice chat. There is also a clan system that works like normal, and the clan has a special 'clan vault' that they can use.  +Mega server. All players are on one server, but it works due to the map size.  +Vehicles. The game has various mounts, such as horses and even giant mutated chickens, along with motorbikes, ATVs, dune buggys, and more.  -Microtransactions. Since this is a free to play game, it is a given. You can buy almost any item in the game on their store. But I do not mind doing this from time to time, as I enjoy the game to the point that I want to support it.  -Graphics. They aren't very good. Good news for people on lower end PCs like me, but for somebody running a machine that costs as much as a small family vehicle, not so much.  -Voice acting. Barely any of it... at all. It is really BAD, it just isn't common.  -Buggy. Some bugs will occur in the game, but there is usually a fix. Usually.  TL;DR: This game is a pretty fun first person post apocalyptic online RPG. Possibly the only one of its kind. If you liked Fallout, you should try it out. If you hated Fallout, you. I reccomand this game for anyone, really. 
7515	1	a	Best post apocalyptic mmo I have ever played, but then again there are not many out there. I will admit as of this recommendation I am not that far in-game, but from what I have seen, it's definitely a keeper! You have got to try fallen earth.
7517	1	a	With a story that was developed with obvious care, to the extent that character-respawning is one of the largest facets of the game, you can tell that this game had it's heart in the right place. This may seem like nonsense to you, but a lot of games out there these days simply tack on the story to the rest of the game, rather than the other way around (as it should).  With a game like Fallen Earth, you can tell that the story came first, and everything else was built around there; from the architecture, weapons, vehicles, and equipment, it all makes sense within the setting. With the way the game's story is, there isn't the problem of 'when everyone in an MMO is the chosen character, no one is', and the characters within the game treat you as a person and not The Big Cool Hero. Extremely refreshing.  If that doesn't say anything, let me tell you something about my hours in this game (on the other version of Fallen Earth, as there are two in Steam, as for a little while FE wasn't on Steam): I have over 2000 hours in the game, a feat surpassed only by my GMOD hours.
5128	0	a	Appeals to a large variety of MMO players but due to the lack of support over the last few years and the constant downtime and crashing nowadays i just can't recommend this game to anyone.
7519	1	a	First impressions:  As you can see (at the time of writing), I haven't played the game much, as such I can only write about first impressions.  Loading the game initially through steam, account setup is pretty basic (log in, verify e-mail, get to playing) except for one tiny detail... you can't choose your user name. The software generates a hash code for your name (around 20 characters in length including upper/lower case letters, numbers, and hyphens ( - ) ) and I have to say... the support team is *FAR* less than helpful (their response : we can't change unique user names)...  Okay, let me rant a moment... so what they're saying is their programmers can't use SQL? Can't use PHP? Can't... um... access their OWN databases? I think not... I think someone is too lazy to correct their mistake. Log in with an e-mail because 'that's the username'... but tried logging in with my e-mail and it says 'invalid username' but using the hash... all hunky dory.  There, that's out of the way, let's get to the game itself and not the customer service.  The game is old-school. The graphics sit somewhere between Fallout 2 and Fallout 3. The NPCs and 'Monsters' are all standing around in one place, tethered to a spot (where they will chase after you for a predetermined distance before giving up and returning to their spawn) ~ a lot like EverQuest 1. The world itself is a little on the empty side, but I cannot honestly say if it remains this way (the internal zones and buildings are pretty cool, and for a game that is set in a wasted world, it's as desolate as it should be).  The story-line is thoughtful and creative, even if it's a little flat and tired. It is interesting, it is engaging, it's just that it's a bit 'old.'  The GMs are super helpful, and I've seen them online every time I've logged in. The help channel is busy, and responsive (I can't even begin to say how refreshing that is)! That said... they have the typical censored chat system that is pretty much par for the course... but don't bother censoring your own words (like: aw s*** that sucks) because a GM will threaten to mute you for language (a redundancy which borders on zealous). Hardly anything to complain about... keep it clean (and PG so you don't offend the super-innocent teenagers playing this game - note sarcasm).  Movement is a bit cumbersome and unweildly ~ but once you're used to it it isn't too bad (such as hitting tab or the middle mouse button to turn on targeting, and therefore a locked mouselook instead of free-look). It's pretty hard to get the camera around front of your character (but it's entirely possible I've just overlooked something).  Skills, stats, levelling, trades... a detailed system. A wonderfully detailed system. APs (which I may mistakenly believe to mean 'action points') are granted frequently in small doses for everything from quest completion to simply levelling up your trade skills. Mousing over anything will give you a clear and detailed description of what that thing is for and what it does and what it effects - I've long desired that games did this, some do, but FE starts with this right out of the gate... they do NOT leave you in the dark (as long as you can read at a Junior High level, it's sweet).  Questing is a bit weird to get used to - the map (okay, the map... WOW... if you like detailed maps that don't hold your hand, but make some pretty obvious markers... then this map system is for you - detail, detail, detail... easily one of the most beautiful map systems I've seen in a game in a LONG time)... anyway, the map... shows a little red X on your radar that when you mouse-over it will show you the name of the quest it's for. There are no indications of distance on the radar or for quests, and some quests are a bit ambiguous (really, they just don't hold your hand there - read it... then figure it out ya lazy bums)!  Will I continue playing? You bet. What is the not free to play? Buying keys for dropped lockboxes. Unlocking your entire wardrobe. Paying for premium content (usually access to skills, timers, clothing, zones, etc) in three different monthly plans (from about $12 to $30), not so bad - but pretty steep considering you can get a great deal more out of a game like LotRO (Lord of the Rings Online) for about $15/month, with far better quality and content. Still, not too bad, save that it's comfortably on the expensive side (especially for what it is and offers).  Do I recommend it? Yes. Get past the opening stuff. Put some points into Intelligence and Perception (both of those increase your maximums for tradeskills), and READ THE QUESTS.  If you don't like reading, or actively engaging a game... this isn't for you. I, however, love reading the content in a game (I want to see what other writers and creative teams are doing with their work) and I enjoy a challenge. As such, I really enjoy this.  In short, a rocky start, some negative experience with the customer service and GMs, a bit unweildly and old-school, and expensive beyond the F2P... but a game that grows on you quickly and really eats up time (that's a mark of a good game right there).  Test it out. If you liked Fallout 2 and 3, then you'll probably enjoy this. I don't think it's a 'long term' game (as far as playability) in my books, but that's simply my own opinion and nothing more. Plenty of players are really enjoying this game, and that speaks volumes about the overall content and quality.
5129	0	a	Fallen Earth is a post-apocalyptic game with sci-fi technology. It was released September 22, 2009 and with that said... Making a game with let's just go with a major title, CoD or Battlefield like graphics...It'd need a engine to process it and this is a game already finished. So the graphics are dated, even at it's highest setting can look like a mudded mess.  You know what, no, no, I wanted to be a bit nice to this game. Look at my screenshots. The mane of my horse, a free mount is beyond s***. Hell my shadow while in first person is cut in half at the waist, and there's no first person animations what so ever. There are in third, but that is just horrid. If that isn't bad enough you get spells and skills like in World of Warcraft..I'm playing at max settings mind you. There are no animations, effects, nothing like that for anything you use in first person. So I don't know if I'm using a poison spell or a spell that s***s f***ing rainbows. Should I mention if I try to heal while in combat that I'll actually heal my enemy? WHAT!?! Oh yes, you have to TARGET yourself to HEAL yourself.  This game is a hardcore knock off of Fallout 3 and New Vegas. The graphics are the same if not worse then both, huge lack of animations, glitches, and just awful, dreadfully poor, sloppy and LAZY design work. If that doesn't p*** you off then what about the fact you have to swap from mouse to aim every 2 minutes to click on a quest, item, object, whatever it be..Ending tutorials, etc.. Oh your mouse cursor is what they use as the game cursor. That's just f***ing pathetic work.   Another fun thing is crafting, and timers. They haven't yet, but I'm damn sure a single timer can easily eventually be an hour if not longer. By the way you can only craft ONE, ONE ITEM AT A TIME IF you do not buy their stupid VIP. Want more, I've yet to go into PvP and frankly I don't think I want to with the other reviews I've read. Already see paid content is able to move ridiculously faster, and it seems at best if you don't pay for the game you're getting a horse. My mind is just blown. That's just mounts/vehicles...What about these keys and boxes and crap that give amazing gear you CANNOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE?! No. Just no. It figures, any title under 'GamersFirst' is nothing but a pryamid scheme for your money. I'm dead serious too, look at APB: Reloaded and APB.  Oh and the learning curve on this game might as well be a f***ing mountain flying in the air. If it wasn't for having looked at my keybinds, and even then I'd be having difficulty as hell. Don't forget, no animations, effects, etc. with most spells/skills/s***s/f***s I don't give about! The game is about you though and the other 20 or so people around, you died at the Hoover Dam and now you're a clone. Should I mention everyone here and everywhere else f***ing hates clones? You might as well be a Jew in NAZI Germany. Question, what game allows jumping that can't allow turning while in mid-air? Answer, Fallen Earth. S*** YOU NOT. The map could be really big, the thing is though... I DON'T HAVE THE F***ING ABILITY TO SCROLL AROUND THE MAP.  3/10 I will never recommend playing this game, even to see if it's really that bad. It's worse.
7521	1	a	I highly recommend Fallen Earth as a long time player I've seen this game go from greatness down to the mud and back again. The community is great and has a high loyal player base. No other game that I have ever played has brought me back to it as much as this one has. I see many negative reviews on this but if u notice their play time in game its less than 2hrs at most. Dont be fooled the game is even better with a low player count, it truly does give it that feeling of an apocalypse. Instead of running into someone every 2 secs considerably takes away the immersion of being a post apoclyptic game.   I highly recommend this game, Join Royal Bloodline a noob helping clan.
5130	0	a	  There once was a good dev studio icarus who made this game, and they made it really well, the core game is awesome. Huge world to explore, somewhat interesting story, there's about 400 hrs of pve content, after that you'll ask yourself what's next? Well right now the answer is nothing, with population so low there's no pvp going on, which is actually really fun, even though hard to learn how to do it properly.   This game is not pay to win, I mean I really enjoyed game at first and bought steam package, I don't regret getting it, you can purchase subscription or buy tradeable premium for ingame currency, I bought a lof of them, I always had commander premium and it wasn't hard to earn enough game currency for it, there're multiple ways to make money in game, pve and pvp(but that's not the case now probably as population dropped heavily). I like the game so much that I would even pay for subscription anyway if not one but, and that's a big one, the G1, who bought the game doesn't develop it anymore, they keep 3 or 5 ppl on the staff and they do very little in game, it feels very abandoned. There's no anticheat and there's also ways to dupe in game, they can't fix that, even though some dupers sent them mail telling how to fix it, but they didn't do anything.  it's no longer an mmo, more like a bunch of ppl online, on top of that they downgraded their servers a few times, so there's much more lag, the content that G1 did is unfinished, and it's just a dead side of the map where nothing happens, they ruined the game and as long as they own it I can't recommend this game.  
5131	0	a	The updater is beyond broken so good luck even trying to update. or even play.  This should be removed from steam since it's dead and broken beyond repair.
5132	0	a	Dig the game, but the shortcomings are a bit too many. The crafting system gets to be a bit unbalanced, and the length of time it takes to make things, can frankly put folks with jobs and real life responsibilities, off. Add in a slew of cash shop items that give you insane advantages, and you can begin to see the problem. This feels less like fallout, and more like a generic mmo with cash shop.
7523	1	a	Fallen Earth. A game based on around the Apocalypse in the year 2156. It's a cool concept and was definately in its own league when it was averaging in the thousands for players on daily login a few years ago.  'Is this game like Fallout?' No, they share the same genre. Nothing more. Fallen Earth tops Fallout when it comes to roleplaying and exploration. I've been playing this game for 6 years, I've still only achieved 25% of the achievements on Steam and still haven't found all the tourist spots.   'Is the game dead?' Compared to its prime? Yes. I'd prefer the term 'quiet' there's still a large number of people playing Fallen Earth in areas all over the game world. If anything, it adds to the genre of it being a post apocalyptic game with players being few and far between.  This game is heavily based around crafting, as such the in game economy is subject to amazing highs and devastating lows. Inflation sets in, items you farmed for hours are worth nothing and that one item you kept hold of is worth a small fortune. Give or take a certain length of time it returns back to normal.  The controls in this game leave a lot to be desired, it doesn't compare to your up to date MMORPG currently on the market, but that is not where this game is a powerhouse. It's not in PvP either.  So what has this game got, that all other games on the market seem to lack? A social community. Fallen Earth was and is full of players who have roleplayed with one another and had a blast, those who have made clans numbering in the thousands for membership and those who organise fairs for everyone in the game to attend.   So should you play this game? Yes. Don't expect the game to blow you away. The game is what you make it and for me it is not only a game that has allowed me to meet so many good people but also blow me away whenever I come back to it.   The only way for us to get this game worked on again is to get enough players to come back so they will realised Fallen Earth should not be abandoned. The potential here is massive. Lets not waste it.
5139	0	a	I truly want to like this game. It is a post-apocalyptic MMORPG, reminiscent of Mad Max but with a much greater technological and traditional science fiction slant. It is an FPS, with a proper akimbo system and a good variety of firearms. It has delightful melee weaponry in all the flavors one would expect and desire from such a game. The landmarks of classic MMORPG gameplay are all there: mobs, crafting, looting, harvesting, and all the economic factors that come with them. On paper, it is the MMORPG of my dreams, and years ago it was probably up to the task of meeting my dreams fabulously.  Unfortunately, it seems someone forgot about it. Development has stagnated almost completely, its team brutally eviscerated and scattered in the desert. It has aged as well as tropical fruit on the windowsill, no longer pleasing to the senses. The combat is flat, awkward, and crippled by latency issues. Performance is what you would typically expect from an MMORPG, but with some inexplicable stutters and framerate drops that you would not (given the level of visual flair and fidelity). There is an option for Advanced Post FX which is apparently vaseline on the viewport that destroys what little definition and detail the game actually has.  In essence, it has all the ingredients of a fantastic MMORPG and may very well have been one at some point in time, full of promise and ambition. It's such a shame that it has aged so poorly, received little in the way of meaningful updates in the past few years, and seems to embrace a trend of short-lived fascination for new players and long-term disappointment for veterans. It achieves the goal of feeling desolate and abandoned - as all wastelands should - but not in the way that makes a game something one looks forward to jumping into; instead, it feels like one that everyone is quite eager to jump out of, and justifiably so.
7525	1	a	how can a planet fall
7527	1	a	I enjoyed Fallen Earth, but there is a lot to this game that makes me cringe. The crafting times get ridiculous, you don't get much help from the Help chat (if anything you just get extremely annoyed by the noobs asking how to ride a horse), the GM's act like punks as well as most other players, some enemies might be a little overpowered and may require you to bring friends, which are hard to acquire if you aren't lucky, and I guess you're not allowed to hold a ton of chips on hand...? I dunno, I had red chips in the mail and some on hand, but couldn't collect them. It's been a while since I played, so I don't remember everything, but I think I had to get premium to hold more or something like that.  It's not all that bad, though. It's good for an apocolypse game that comes with good ideas for character builds and such. I like that you can craft pretty much everything you need, but some materials are extremely hard to get, and as I said beore, the crafting times are crazy. FE is basically an apocolyptic World of Warcraft. Obviously not as big, popular, or 'fixed'.  7/10 in my opinion to say the least.
5141	0	a	Well, despite the fact I have 101.9 hours playing this game on Steam, I am a veteran that played it almost 2-3 years, when it became F2P (yes, this game was once paid), stopped for a period of 5 years, and came back to play again. So my review will have lots of comparisons with the former years I've played.  Long story short: Actual state of the game is almost --dead--. No other word to define it. Few players (barely 60-70), counting with the newer players that come slowly in numbers. The peak number of players, I suppose, never reached 200 or maybe 250. You will understand that this number is important when you know the HUGE extension of map.  I will now point the most important details that will explain my veredict:   OBS.: It is a HUGE text with plenty of details. You were warned.   1. Features and Gameplay  Fallen Earth implements very nice features, specially in terms of crafting and item reuse in crafting, that means, sometimes you need a specific craftable item to craft a better one. So, you won't waste a ton of items just to grind th hell of your crafting skill and throw away all â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you built to the air as it wasn't important. It was (when there was a handful of players around), now it is NOT anymore.  Gameplay is still kinda robotic, with some need for grinding. Yeah, it is not a freaking grind, because there are plenty of missions, and most of them, are related OR with the linear storyline, or with a sidestory that reflects one specific situation, like, the reason of a decaying state of a city, per example. So you don't need to kill thousands of mutants to just earn levels. Just do the missions.  The need of teamwork only is vital on the last level (55) when you reach a region called Alpha County, where the mobs are very difficult to beat alone, specially if you're a full crafter. On some middle-level bosses there is also one need of teamwork, but mainly, after you reach 55. And it has no meaning because the missions in Aplha County give mostly chips (ingame money), experience (that you won't need as you've reached the cap) and, a few of those missions, faction reputation. So, in a basis, no one does those missions because there is no need to do so.  2. Missions  As I've said, the missions are quite well made, and have some history behind (some of them). But indeed they're very straightforward (kill x wolves, collect y materials, destroy z element). There are no puzzles, nothing that could difficult the conclusion of a mission except for one or another boss that has a big pool of health and so you need some friends to finish it. Apart from that, easy missions, nothing spectacular, nothing puzzling. Just normal missions that follows one sidestory or the main storyline.  The only exception are the Defense Towns, where there is a mission to maintain one player-built town (it has 4 in total in game) and, from time to time, a big raid distributed in various waves appear to storm this city. The mission asks you and the other players to defend the town and counter this raid. Remember teamwork? If you don't have it, you lose the city, the city that you and other players built, and can rebuild again if lose. Why that? What's the advantage? Resource nodes around the town, plenty of them appears depending on which buildings were constructed. Trust me, it worths.  3. Crafting  Here is the jewel of the game, and I really thumbs up for this. The game has a complex crafting system, where you have a wide range of melee weapons (hammers, pickaxes, slesgehammers and even a big bar with a 40kg weight), ranged weapons (pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers), various armors and clothes, food and drink, buildings (generally temporary, except from Defense Town buildings), vehicles parts and vehicles assemble, live mounts (horses and wolves), medicine items, poisons, grenades, bombs. The variety is damn extensive, and everything has its purpose: help you against the dangers of the Wastes (including other players). Full crafters have some fun unlocking complex recipes and distribute the products for your clanmates or the open market (Auction house), and this is one thing Fallen Earth still maintains on a positive stats.  4. PvP  The PvP on this game has a freaking damn potential, because it is firmed in one thing: the Faction Wheel. First things first: on a determined level, you need to choose a faction. There are six, i won't go into details, but if you choose one, you start to build some reputation with the faction (throught certain missions) you chose mainly, and with two other factions on a lower basis. On the other side, the other three becomes your enemies (your reputation with them diminshes on the same amount you earn for your faction and allies).  Inside the huge territory of FE, there are PvP areas with outposts or keeps, where a faction that takes control of that keep, rules the area, and has some benefits, including special resource nodes and the option to lay down harvesters (resource drillers). When the game had a big amount of active players (5 years ago), the fight for power was so imense AND insane, that keeps and fortresses normally were conquered and reconquered within one or two hours (counting that it has 45 minutes of immunity after it is capped).  The actual state of PvP is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, because there are not enough players to maintain an all-out war or a domination war over the PvP areas. You even find one or other flag caps, but nothing near the PvP state of 5 years ago.  5. The company (Gamers First)  I could say a bunch of bad things about G1, because, there are mostly only bad things about them related to FE. Suffice to say, when G1 bought FE from Reloaded Productions/Icarus Studios and changed the business model to F2P, a massive number of players quit the game on the next weeks, they knew what exactly would happen with the game, even with the fact Reloaded team would keep working on the game changes and new expansions. G1's legacy in turn one succesful game in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is long and bold. Just ask the players of APB: Reloaded how the game is now. FE isn't an exception: the only news we, FE players, see are the Subscribers Rewards every month, mostly. Fallen Earth became, for G1, another reasonable source of money from subs, veteran players who still manage to like the game despite the lack of improvement over the years (only one new map expansion, a few new vehicles and gear and a new PvE coop mode called The Dome, all this in 5 years ... FIVE YEARS!!!!). What I could say to G1?? Follow the example of Keen Software House and 'Space Engineers' game title. One update every week, either bug fixings or new improvements, EVERY WEEK FOR BLESSED 1 and 1/2 YEARS!!  Conclusion  I'd say, if you want one good experience of free open world game, you can even try Fallen Earth. It is a nice experience. You can still get addicted, but BE SURE that the end game, from the day of that review, is frustrating. To be very honest, the word that resumes all my experience from 5 years ago and now is this:  frustration . But well, I have friends on this game, so that's why I still play. And the game has some nice features (thanks to Icarus Studios) I do study to develop something similar, so that's why I play. But, after all, considering the whole product and its actual state, I do NOT recommend the game.
5142	0	a	OMG This game had the potential to be great, not good but GREAT! As usual they are out for money, but they don't care about their customers. Features are there but due to the bugs are unusable and do not get fixed. The customer service either is incompetant or just unwilling to help with some issues and that makes the game not worth anyone's money let alone time. The crafting is good except for the time to craft gets very bad. Grouping and their maping system is terribly executed and still not fixed. MOBs are everywhere including areas that do not need it but in areas you would expect it, it is empty. it is a game that you can play and reach max level really quick if you want. No real story and some quests are terrible while others are set perfectly without any rhyme or reason. Tradeskills are about 90% to where they need to be but better than most other games out there. Storage is okay but needs more upgradablity.Help channel is okay but don't bother trying to talk to the GMs about anything because they really don't care and would rather help their friends not you.
7529	1	a	  It's been 7 years or so, since I first started to play this game. For almost 2 years, I was barely surviving around Midway, trying to search for resources, never heard of Crafting recipes. Might sound like a bad joke, but truth be told, I was making some chips through the scavanging and buying new weapons, killing NPCs, then scavanging again. I was in love with what I've been doing, although I did not know at all anything about how the game works or where I had to go. In time, I was gaining a lot more knowledge about the game while growing. Sadly, humans can't understand many things at such a young age. It is 2016, almost winter, almost turning 2017. One year ago, the game has lost a massive amount of players, yet, Veterans still have the Fallen Earth blood running through their veins, keeping the game alive. All respect. I also count myself.
7531	1	a	Really fun for a while. Environments are beautiful and the people are generally nice.  The Role-playing Community is one of the best I've encountered however, most have left (with myself) due to the fact it gets very repetitive and boring after a few hundred hours.  Good time killer.
5143	0	a	In my opinion this game is not worth anyone's time, and here is why: 1. Launcher downloads and installs 200Mb worth of updates for ages.  2. A lot of EULAs which activate every time I launch the game. 3. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics and animations. I know the game is old, but for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s sake refresh it from time to time. If modders can do it, so can you. 4. Character customization unacceptable. Not enough options to choose from, and existing ones are fugly. 5. Controls are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Movement is jerky, its god damn hard to access stuff around you. there are two screen modes where one is basically there for no reason. Everything could be and was intergrated into a single mode and nobody should have to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing switch it. UI layouts are kind of neat, but god damn hard to access with those camera and mouse modes. Designer should quit alcohol. 6. Can't block in melee, gun recoil is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, shooting sounds and effects are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 7. Right after the tutorial game glitched and caused me to fall perpetually. Had to close it by ending Processes in Task Manager.   2/10
7533	1	a	Crafted ammo and I earned a horse 10/10 would craft again
7535	1	a	a decent game but as i have seen pointed out it lacks imagination in some of the enemies and the bosses just soak up bullets but overall its a decent game about like runescape but again not the same you will just have to check it out  things it has that make it worth the time  - player built vehicals - factions (player controlled and non) - pvp and pve  - decent respawn system that will make you work to get your stuff back but wont make it easy mode - interesting selection of weapons   thats the highlights feel free to try it out its a free game aside from some in game things but thats how the gaame keeps running so overall its a decent game but fun if you like FPS games
7537	1	a	Amazing for a f2p game, the feeling of getting your first actual gun is like getting your first helmet in WoW back in vanilla. The mount system isn't perfect, but is deffinately above par. The crafting system is actually really fun to grind for, and the actual explorable world is massive, none of it feels like blank space inbetween more detailed areas. PvP sounds like it would be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ show, but is actually fairly balanced. Auction house system is deffinately well thought through. Although there are immense amounts of weapons, none of them feel useless or like filler. Quests are actually fun and have some difficulty. There is always someone friendly at the beginner town who would gladly accept help or offer it themselves. Combat is okay, nothing to write home about.
7539	1	a	Post Appocalypt Earth caused by Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Zombies. being the first MMO I actually Liked, going into towns and helping peopled was a realy sattisfying experience. But then I ran into delema's with the main story where you are not a single man army. This game will probably be more fun if you work in packs or join a guild, Also, this game isn't free if you, it's just got a free mode that used to be sweet. It still is sweet, but a sometime after the release of the free edition, they removed the ability to have craft ques for free players.
7541	1	a	Updated : 8/18/15  Currently the game has undergone large changes to the combat system (Skills and Mutations mainly) which gives far more choices for character builds. Previously there were skills, and mutations, that were not worth taking for any given reason. This isn't the case anymore.  Missions beyond Sector 1 are terrible unless unlocking vanity items or social boosting items, you're better off spending your time killing NPCs that give the best XP for the least effort (rats for example) because the Devs are most likely never going to fix this issue.  The 'story' within the missions is still good, but you will feel cheated after completing a 5 hour long quest that you could have earned 30x the experience along with 20x the profit/reward.  Weapon choices for PVP will feel very 'one sided' in 1v1. I recommend not going 'Rifle' if you plan to fight 1v1 in PVP. In Group fights is where it shines, I strongly recommend avoiding Assault or Battle Rifles at level 55.  Lack of updates since the previous major update (8/1/2014) beyond increasing 'Dome Tokens' have lead to a heavy decline in population. DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME TO HAVE REGULAR UPDATES, the Devs are depressing when it comes to this. Not to mention never finishing projects completely... they simply move on to the next 'big' project.  Examples : Terminal Woods, Alpha, TC, and Dome, None of these are 'finished', just 'acceptable'.  If you plan to get to end-game, ignore ALL previous weapons/armor at 55. As there is no progression into the newer armors, it is best to save all your chips/DT for the AP weapons and GT Armor since they are the same price or lower than the previous armors.  DO NOT EXPECT TO NOT DIE TO SOMEONE WITHIN YOUR FACTION IN PVP : It is intended through lore and mechanically for your own faction to beable to kill you in PVP, this is indeed a wasteland and should be treated as such.  THERE IS NO GROUP CONTENT WORTH DOING IN THIS GAME : It is nice to bring a friend, but don't expect to find some amazing place for your 8-32+ group that's challenging... let alone rewarding :(  I only play now to help others learn the game, kill rerollers (those who remake after previous bans), and PVP if there is any.   While the game is old, it is limited by F2P standards I would recommend it for a game to play if you enjoy MMOs, crafting, and of course PVP. Only downside, don't expect to master 1 skill, it's better to be great all across the board on skills to give yourself the best advantage in PVP at least.
5149	0	a	Combat seems very basic, npcs stand still till you get close enough and the menu system isnt as user friendly as other games. I dont see how this was ever a pay to play game.  Has good theory but isnt pulled off, the world has no life to it.
7543	1	a	i actually enjoyed playing this game, it is different, but i think it is still a bit too buggy for my taste, getting stuck in the respawn tube or transporting, or even just on pebbles in the road this needs an update badly to fix some issues then it would be awsome like fallout on crack, but now its fallout if fallout was that one 'special' student we all had in our class growing up, but still i think it is very much worth a try, the devs should open it up to allow fans to maybe help them make better and newer patches for the game, just an idea
7545	1	a	I consider myself very discerning when it comes to games. I don't play very many, but the ones I do play I tend to play a lot. More often than not I'll find myself getting bored of whatever game I'm trying out within the first few hours. I decided to try this game out and take a chance on the mixed reviews after seeing it on Steam many many times.   At 30 hours in I can safely say I'm hooked. The crafting system really is AMAZING. Potions, poisons, medical kits, weapons, armors, clothing, dyes, VEHICLES (including but not limited to motorcycles, ATV's, cars, trucks), and you can craft create temporary building and camps. That's just a small portion of it.  Skill system is easy to use and straight forward, combat is familiar and was easy to transition to, not sure what else I can say.   On the negative side, the game world coudl use some more clutter. Wandering around the map feels quite barren. And the server downtimes need to be addressed. This is killing this game for me despite all the great potential it has. I've been playing it for 5 days and the servers have gone down for 1 hour intervals at least 3 times and has gone down for extended intervals on anther two seperate occasions. This is on top of regular maintenance. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Despite this I'll give this game a positive review and recommend it assuming this one huge issue will be fixed ASAP
7547	1	a	Download the game Call it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Uninstall the game  Come back to the game it's pretty cool it gets boring uninstall the game  Come back to the game It's awesome it gets boring uninstall the game  But somehow, the game is still fun.
7549	1	a	Fallen earth really was a surprise for me. Ive been playing for around a year now on the standard client and I can't say enough about this game. Switching over to steam client version was perfect for sharing moments with friends. I am really having a blast playing it right now. Steep learning curve keeps a lot of the 'usual' mmo crowd out. This I like! Huge open sandbox world. Think I read over 5,500 quests and 11,000 square miles of area? MASSIVE!  The game has some amazing developers under its wing too. They are trying to improve the game daily with small updates, bug fixes and is one of the minor few games which takes community thoughts and feelings into persepctive.  Great community and if you get stuck or need a friend to help there are help chats, auctions, private chats &amp; town chats (In-game!)  Class-less characters to play as you wish and 6 factions and the factions are not all against each other but have their enemies, arch enemy, and allies among those 6. The character design feature is superb also! Very open and user friendly.  The graphics and model designs are not the best in quality terms but its not about the graphics on Fallen earth. The quests and community is the main focus in my opnion; which is great! Got a nice mix of PvE and PvP. PvP in certain areas as well as conflict towns in the higher zones.  Concluding, Fallen Earth is a great game if you have a varied lifestyle with a couple of hours every week to login and play. System specs are a little high but this keeps the younger generations away, A more adult style game.   Worth a try! (4 Stars)
7551	1	a	Fallen earth is a great game that has a larger then most like learning curve,and that's most likley why it gets bad reviews. For being 7 years old and has no Dev support for the last couple. I still have a lot of fun running around the wastelands. It's crafting system is one of the best I have ever come across in any other MMO, only one better is SWG.  I would recommend this game over many of the new trash cookie cutter WOW clones that have been coming out lately.
7553	1	a	You like: - complex crafting - open worlds - classless character progression - postapocalyptic setting - manual targeting  You don't expect: - a very colorful cheerful game - a set on rails progression - next-gen graphics  If this fits to what you like, then you will most likely like this game. The crafting is great, the graphics are in some ways not so good (character animations), in some ways average (character models), in some ways really nice (for example having a huge view over the open landscape during a sunset).  It's definately not for everyone, but I enjoyed it a lot and played it a lot. The community is friendly and helpful too. There are a lot of factions, an ongoing storyline, and you often have 'what is behind that hill' moments. And Fallen Earth lets you find out what is behind that hill. There are no invisible walls (except that you can't enter water, of which there is not much to begin with).  I think the game is very relaxing, when you ride over the open landscape and look forward to have your next crafting items finished (crafting can be done while you are offline or doing other stuff), and at times intense, when you are stuck in a cave full of spiders and slowly running out of ammo.
7555	1	a	If this game is next gen then I am building a Delorean and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing myself with it's tailpipe. This game is so gay it makes my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ smaller, even though asian woman want that on their feet, I don't. I will literally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in a cup and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with my tongue then finger it to hell. I would rather suck my own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of my 2 buttcheeks than play in the garbage that makes me â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ myself twelve times from sunday morning.
5152	0	a	This game just sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥. Devs aren't going to fix anything. Ai can heal them self to full health instantly if they want, They can jump to roofs and run trough walls and hit you from 100m distance with a melee weapon. This game is not worth your time, don't even try it.
7557	1	a	Cool game to play with your friends/roleplay/explore. The world is pretty cool and the crafting system is neat but it's also a bit grindy. Would recommend for people who like to grind or roleplay with their friends. THANK YOU.
5153	0	a	The microtransactions are unbecoming. The community is mixed, some trolls some helpful, and the gm's, on average, are over zealous. I had some fun while playing, but making a purchase is the only reason it was playable. I have an acquaintence who RP's and they really enjoy the game and has made no purchases, however, they recieved the perks of males being nice to a female. While I know what it is now, and I wouldn't waste the space on my drive knowing what I know, I'd still suggest that if you're curious find out for yourself.  *Update: My characters have been deleted while that could be due to inactivity my g1c purchases are forever gone. Caveat emptor I found out about the missing characters when I logged in on my female acquaintance's PC.
7559	1	a	Fallen Earth is a very fun and unique game, it has a lot of features such as mining rocks and scavaging in rubbish piles...with the copper you mine from rocks you can craft into bullets. You can also lvl up geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards. I have not seen many fps open world mmorpg's around and this is quite the package if you are looking for a game like this.
7561	1	a	very good game   take control of towns with your gang and get cars and guns fight monsters lvl up   9/10   
5154	0	a	The uninstall button worked. Nothing else.
7563	1	a	I like this game, but it has many problems people won't simply dismiss. I for one can forgive them but it confuses why these problems exist. Problems like animation, hitboxes, crafting system. They all seem outdated and worse versions of what other games do. The first person animations are monstrous, but the third person animations are alright. The hitboxes can be a bit wierd but bearable. The crafting system is a click, wait, get kind of system, where you get the materials, hit craft, wait a while (5 min to 10 hours depending on the item.) then you go and get it from the menu. Also something that bugged me was that this game came out in 2009 originally and that they had the nerve to put a price on this game before it went free to play. This game is a good free to play but paying for it is a horrible and idiotic idea, simply because the polish in this game is next to nothing. This game does get in depth later on though with factions, vehicle (Better vehicles I should say, since you get a horse ealy on.), and more advanced and better looking weaponry. The quests are interesting and sometimes challenging but luckily I had friends to help me out, this also improved the amount of fun that I had with this game. When you first get in it may look like another hotbar World of Warcraft like game (I actually like WoW it's just that many MMO's borrow so much from it that it gets boring.) but all those keys are 100% option for a more 'magic' oriented player. The tutorial is horrible, boring, and useless aside from simply teaching new players and should be skipped if you have played before. Now onto the better parts of this game. It progression is slow but it feels good to finally get that first revolver after using pellet guns for a while. The custimization in this game is good ingame but in character creation it is limited but acceptable. The towns feel alive due to all the other players going around doing their missions, crafting, learning, etc. Now for a more personal opinion, I found this game alright, it gave me fun times with my friends but sometimes I would get locked getting resources in an area for crafting and trading. I saw myself just joking around a lot before heading out to do a mission, which my friends would have fights over because some would go ahead of each other and it honestly annoyed me. This game also has PvP which I never participated in since I had no real reason to. This game gave me some rewarding progression (Which was created from the effort and time put in), confussion as to why it isn't more polished and improved, and a annoying but sometimes fun time with my friends. If I would have to give this a score it would honestly be a 5/10. I see the appeal here it's just I can't get over why it is like it is now: a messy MMO shooter with mechanics which could be improved easily. I recommend this game to someone who takes MMO's as serious as a mature Arma player.
5155	0	a	If you like fallout, please do not play this trash. This is a terrible, broken game. Hasselhoff does not approve of a game that does not allow to actually edit audio. Some woman was talking and it was like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 1000 decibals.
7565	1	a	This is a very good game. I love the crafting system, and being able to buy the gear you cant get off of an auction. The one thing I really dont like about this game is... it dosent feel like a survival game. Sure you can food, but all it does is give you some boosts. I would love to see a version with more survival aspects. I'll give this game.....8.5/10
7567	1	a	althought it may not have good graphics this game can get pretty fun once u get into it :3  10/10 -  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.com 
7569	1	a	An okay game overall, but I made some righteous friends on here so 8/10 for that
5157	0	a	game was awesome but the fact is, that today the game is dead and the fact that someone hacked into my clan, disbanded it and took all my stuff that was into the clan vault, i would get them off and put on my vault but my vaults were full, don't play this game because you'll find nothing but idiots and sometimes trolls, and if you go to PVP, you must be one of the 'terror raiders' otherwise you'll be overwhelmed, because almost every pvper in the game is in that damn clan today
5158	0	a	*Launches game* *Talks to man* *Man gives me a mission* *Walls dissapear* *Falls through ground* *Game crashes *Game reopens itself* 'Would you like to exit to desktop?' 'No' *attempts to kill first enemy* *dies* *game crashes*
7571	1	a	For a Free Game, this game rocks! In 2 days I have already put 20 hours into the game. This game has so much to do, and so much is going on, that you are spoiled with missions and activities! If you're looking for an RPG in the Post-Apocoliptic era, or you just wanna play a game similar looking to Fallout, than this is a game I highly recommend downloading, whats even better is if you don't like it you're not losing anything because its FREE, and I am surprised it is after how much fun this game is. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a good game and have fun with other players. This game has most pieces to an RPG game such as Clans, Events, Tons of Weapon, Armour, and Clothes! It also has skills you level up after getting AP Points, which yout hen use to upgrade your skills. The crafting system is also nice, and you can basically craft almost anything.   (PS if you're trying to download this game and you think the Update downloader is stuck, its not. I also thought mine was stuck and after looking up how to fix it I found no solution when turns out I just wasn't being patient. I started the downloader and left it on over night and it was finished by morning! Hopefully that helps any of you that have that 'problem'.)
7573	1	a	A game you must play at least once in your life (and will probably for the rest of your life).   At first the game is a little (very) confusing but as you progress and figure it out it gets interesting, fun and will take up a lot of your time. It first gave me the impression of 'just another game' but is very far from. It is quest based and leaves you wanting to complete more and more - addictive so to speak and the quests are reasonably challenging for whichever level you are. It has many items to loot and craft, every time you think you've figured it all out and there cannot possibly be any more it surprises you with something new and even more curious than the last.  Another thing I really like about this game is that you can ask for help at anytime and you will get it. Gamers are friendly and willing to help in chat. It gives a sense of comfort for those who 'get lost'.
5159	0	a	outdated look, uninteresting combat, dialog sounds like its from the 90s. you are better off just playing fallout with mods.
7575	1	a	Surprising game  The people playing it seem to be helpful. Found a clan and they have been really great. I find the game really fun because of this. No hand holding in this game. You make it your own fun here.
7577	1	a	Well i played 5.3 hours but i'm already a fan. This game is nuts. I love this!!! 
7579	1	a	I've only put a little over an hour... but man I am HOOKED. It takes a little getting used to, but the whole idea behind it brings a new perception to MMO's. The multiple item equips is awesome (especially how it shows on your body), the skills, the mounts (You get one for free at the begininning!). It is a little glitchy here and there, and the constant changing views can get a little annoying.. but past that it is a good game to get, especially if you want to play with friends (there's a reason why it's an MMO). Get it now! It's free and definitely worth the time!
7581	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
7583	1	a	Want fallout but cant buy it? Here ya go
7585	1	a	This game is fun Just needs players.
7587	1	a	I don't care what anyone says, I love this game.
7589	1	a	An exelante game for any MMO fanatic. Game that will keep you busy for a very long time with allot of different people from around the world trying to carve their own little place out in the wasteland. Has a couple of bugs now and then but is fixed with a simple relog, and also has a very active update and bug fixing comunity that maintains it. Has a very comlicated HUD but you make it your own. Modular HUD.  After more than 1000 hours on this game, I must say it was nice. It does get very frustrating waiting for crafts to finish, and getting all of the materials but in the end its all worth it. A game that will keep you busy for a very very VERY long time and has so much to offer. Looking at the Single Player content such as NPC's that give missions and places to discover on your own, it has more than 1000 hours worth in it. I have not even covered 1/4 of it yet. PvP is somewhat a battle but you get the hang of it, make sure you got a good build for it though. This game is very modular in allot of ways, from HUD layout, to Charachter Build and Look. You are set free in the Wasteland. Group in a clan, gain a faction, make new friend from across the Planet (Seeing that its ONE Global Server) and Survive. So Carve out your own spot to call home in the Wasteland.  At 1199 Hours in this game I have finally reached the maximum ammount of money that you can have on a single character. 9y99r99b99w. This is through only crafting, trading and selling. Something I am very proud of looking back at now in the game.  As of the Steam 2016 Nominations: I know there are many Titles that can keep you glued to your seat saying that iconic yet oh so white lie, 'Just 5 more minutes' but of all of them I believe Fallen Earth has drawn me in the most. (As an Massive Multiplayer Online Game) Community, Crafting, Setting and just the aspect of exploring this massive world all connected as one server. It was a grind, but all of those grinding memories are oh so cherished. Thank you to the Developers of Icarus Studios, LLC.
7591	1	a	I'm new to this game that's why I can't tell you much about this yet. This game, as the others says, is a post-apocalyptic MMORPG. I love this game even though there are small number of players. Yes, there are still players playing this game that's why it is not yet 'DEAD'. If you have a problem in-game, just ask in the chatbox and many will respond to you. They will help you a lot. There are also many quests (main or side quests). It is not that easy to level up but it is fun killing and tracking monsters. You can craft, ride horses/vehicles and so on. As of now, that's the only thing I can say. I recommend this game. I'm not telling you to expect that it is a good game, but for me it is awesome. It's still best if you review it yourself. Have a nice day!
7593	1	a	Population is thin. Other wise a great game. It'll take yer time and replace it with fond recalls of how the wasteland was so grinding to collect crap off the land and npcs' bodys.
5163	0	a	Controls are bad, graphics are bad (even on maximum), gameplay is bad, story is bad, so much more to name. Don't get this game. 5.7 GB wasted from monthly bandwidth.
7595	1	a	It's really dead for what it could be, with lots of bugs, but it's still entertaining. gigantic open world to explore and tons of quests to do. Crafting is not that bad after you get the grip of it. played with a friend around 100h outside steam, had good fun. Plus, it's free.
7597	1	a	Was a great game when I played, but sadly there seems to very few people that actually still play it. Some people say its like Fallout but as an MMORPG.
5165	0	a	I wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone, even people I hate.  Pros: Optomised pretty well for low end machines like my laptop that I play on usually.  Cons: Atmosphere is terrible.  Gameplay is terrible  Has microtransactions  A community with the combined IQ of 70  You get muted without warning for saying 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'  Combat is worse than anything I've seen   This game is the worse game I've ever played on steam, It's optomised pretty well, but that's because it's a money making micro transaction F2P game, go figure.  Don't download this game if you're looking for something fun, or good to play. I tried giving it a chance, and it was terrible.
7599	1	a	This game has a huge map, hundreds of different weapons, armors, and enemies, there aren't many people that are on, but its an old as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, everyone in the community knows each other well, sure you can't really do pvp at lower levels, since most people are at the max level, there is a market for buying items with real money, but these are mostly things to make you go through the game faster or vanity, most of the community is very helpful and will randomly give out expensive items that you can sell and make money off of like I did, skill leveling is based on getting exp by crafting and killing, then you put skill points into a skill, mutation or attribute, attributes raise caps on mutations and skills, attribute caps are raised with leveling. Crafting is done with the tradeskills, which are raised by crafting/harvesting. I could go on, but itd be a 10 page document, so I won't
5166	0	a	I played this game for many years before hand and when you see it now. The game is just a barren husk with no content to show for the years I've been away. Nothing new to make me enjoy it also. Everything is now just, boring in it.   Go with Fallout, you'll have more content at your hands than this game ever will.
5167	0	a	Graphics we very 'meh'. After awhile, it got very repetitive with the level grinding. There were also major bugs when I played, but I'd say a good half of them have been fixed since. I haven't chosen to return to this game because I hit the level cap and it wasn't interesting enough to justify paying for it.
5168	0	a	Lens flare, dubstep, overly choppy graphics, cheap knock offs, ingame purchase, super zombie apocalypse 5, with new and improved mechanics and gravy over everything crap.   Pass  
7601	1	a	Time of your life.
5169	0	a	The year is 2156. The Apocalypse has had an Apocalypse. A mutant army is reshaping the world into mutant hell, and only one thing can stop them. From the toxic ashes of Occupy Wallstreet 2 a renegade soldier is born. part man, part hobo. Your character is leading the battle between good and evil, as it has never been faught before. You are on a mission to bring down a battalion of ruthless mutant soldiers, and save the world. ...is what I would like to say. Don't trust the screenshots that allude to gameplay. Herein lies a tragedy. You will spend the majority of your time in expansive untextured areas doing nothing more than shooting mutant dogs with your busted pipe rifle. Avoid, unless that sounds like a good time to you.
5170	0	a	Ignore the community's existence and you're good to go :^)
7603	1	a	Such an underrated game. If you like to craft then this game is for you. Crafting in most MMO's is generally pointless and uninteresting. In Fallen earth you craft everything. All your clothes, all your armour, all your weapons and even your mounts. Want to travel the wasteland in a dune buggy well collect your materials, craft your components and put them together to drive your own set of wheels. This game is all about gathering, quests and crafting.  it has a very friendly community which will answer any question in the chat window instantly. Exploring and fighting is challenging at times but always good fun. the game can be complicated as it is so in depth. Easily the most in depth game i have ever played. The great thing about this game is that it is absolutely free, yes you can subscribe for extra benefits but you can play the whole game for free in its entirity. The graphics are a bit dated now but the gameplay more than makes up for it. its free, give it a go.
5171	0	a	All of my expectations about this game has failed after i played . If you like games like warcraft or fallout ...meh maybe you can play .But if  you were expecting some action based game , this is not what you  are looking for .
5172	0	a	I'm sorry but I couldnt spend more than 5 minutes playing this. The controls felt unresponsive and terrible, the screen flickered and gave me a headache, a nice 'UPGRADE NOW' button thats always on the middle of the screen. I'm going to pass on this one and never look back.
7605	1	a	Alright. This may as well be a rant but I'm going to break this review down on some subcategories. I've been playing this game for a while and recommend it to new people. HOWEVER, for people playing the Alpha and Beta like I had, GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR CHARACTER BACK. G1 basically said 'screw you' to me and I haven't even been able to access my character from maybe...3-6 months ago? Not even? TERRIBLE. 
5175	0	a	After playing for a little bit and ended up realising that this game just isn't fun. They give us an open world that is just completely empty, the hit boxes are horrid, and the fact that in order to PvP you have to accept duals is kinda stupid for a gaint game such as this. This game just feels like World of Warcraft with a Nuclear Apocalypse skin on it. Someone's review said it was like fallout. That is completely wrong it only looks like Fallout:NV (Gaint, empty, and brown being the main color) I would not download this game as it is a complete waist of time and space on your hardrive. Also one other thing, everthing goes by levels, so instead of going around and being ableto take on things and people because they have a gun and you don't you take things on because one side is mega level 9000 (just an expression) and your not. Leaving this unbalanced and enemies just plain boring. Especaily since you start out with a gun that can kill things from lvl1-10. Its just plain boring.
7607	1	a	Still waiting for that Fallout Online pipedream?? While it may be on its way with a- and lets be honest, long overdue announcement. Fallen Earth is here to scratch away those Post-Apocolyptic itching blues.
7609	1	a	brilliant game full of hours og adventuring
7611	1	a	i really liked after you get past the first two hours it alot more open worldly and more fun so ya
7613	1	a	Still waiting for that Fallout Online pipedream?? While it may be on its way with a- and lets be honest, long overdue announcement. Fallen Earth is here to scratch away those Post-Apocolyptic itching blues.
7615	1	a	compare this game to eating a pile of out of date â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ after being deepthroated by a whale and getting assâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed by a horse and you dont still dont have a good comparison of this game
7617	1	a	The game is very good, I'm Russian, so I can not fully enjoy the story, since I can not translate all fully ... Please add the Russian language in the game ...
7619	1	a	Fallen Earth Pros:  -Amazing environment and immersion -Wonderful PvP gameplay -A rediculously good crafting system -A large ready-to-explore map to quench your need for adventure -55 levels with new gear no matter what you're at -Conveniantly placed merchants and fairly easy-to-master Fast Travel system for teleporting all over the map at low cost Auction prices that players post are generally fair*  Fallen Earth Cons: -The majority of the staff team needs work or improvement as far as moderation and fairness goes (this is prone to change whenever they may so improve) -The community is easy to get sucked into, and not in a good way, people tend to troll endlessly if you get them going, and they can go on for hours and never shut up due to mass amounts of self-pride and ignorance -Everyone types with their face -The Auction can sometimes become inflated but over-all it's fair*  Do I reccomend it? Yes! This game is unlike any other, and you can't say Fallout beats it because last I checked Fallout didn't have the balls to be an MMO! Let alone FREE TO PLAY YOUR WAY!
7621	1	a	its weird hard to understand the mechanics but its pretty good if you figure it out i repeat if you (figure It out)
7623	1	a	If you like fallout 3, this is the closest thing to it in an MMO. I am addictted to this game. Has older graphics but if you don't care about that, i would recomend it. I mean come on it's free.
7625	1	a	I played this game on and off for the last few years. Sure its pretty dated but it holds together well.   It's really in its on niche at times, but it's still great.   It's not exactly a causal game or regular player game. It just depends on what you want to do, because the world and its missions are are pretty open.   It's worth trying at least once.      
7627	1	a	So happy this is free-to-play now, had a lot of fun when it first released. Graphics are dated but if you can get past that its a pretty cool and unique MMO in a world of garbage clones.
7629	1	a	I Honestly Enjoyed this Game , alittle thing w are all looking for , crafting , uniqueness in character customization, contruction , PVP , And a great storyline that satifies all of us RPG-pvp loving fanatics, i haven't played that long yet, but so far its very smooth and has really good graphics. no bugs of my knowledge , Props to the Devs on this one :D
7631	1	a	I played little of this game. But so far great game! I just wish it was more like dayz where you loot off the ground and in buildings and if you die in pvp you lose gear thats what i like but its still a good game.
7633	1	a	Watched cooking videos, got freemium.  10/10 - IGN
5178	0	a	this game is VERY incomplete. the game needs more sound theres hardly any and this makes for an underwhelming game, i also think that the controls are a bit much and also very odd (i.e Y being the action/interact button). However for the most part the character design was pretty awesome and the only thing i think they should do to it is add a few more clothing options.
7635	1	a	Obviously it's getting a good review, 341 hours at the time of writing this.  I can't think of another game I have wasted such a large portion of time on than this one. It's a great game, I suggest you at least try it and play until you're level 15. If it hasn't captivated you by then it won't.
7637	1	a	Its alright if a bit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥... to many player couples that too socially anxious to talk to real girls and guys....
5179	0	a	The game has absurd texture issues even after I tried various fixes, including many variations on the graphical options, the engine itself is buggy as hell, and for some reason the voices are completely distorted. If this game is ever fixed, I'll give it a better review, but with the way things are looking? Not gonna happen.
5180	0	a	Outdated graphics, horrible animations, bad sound assets, cluncky controls.... just no
5181	0	a	just downloaded this game today, and I can already say its not off to a good start...while it seems like a very fun game, and I couldnt wait to get into it myself..as soon as I started to updater, it prompted the login screen (as to be expected) and it gave me the wonderful option to validate it with my Steam account, just behind a tab that says 'No account data found..If you dont have an account, create one now. Would you like to create an account?' but behind it, you have the option to try and create an account just in case..seems pretty standard, and very easy...so I first tried my steam account, only to be told that the username and password didnt match/werent correct...so I tried my steam name in itsself, still nothing...then I decided to take a chance and go ahead and make an account for the games main website, again, a very standard procedure, enter your email and the password you want...type in the random captcha thing to prove your not a spam-bot, then opt in/out for getting emails and newsletters of the site itsself and the original 'by clicking (whatever it is) you agree to the privacy settings and rules' so I clicked it, and now to validate my email!....waiting...still..almost been an hour now and still havent gotten the validation email and I have already tried at least 5 times..if your looking for a good post-biochemical-apocalyptic survival game, from everything I have read and seen..this IS the game to get, especially if your into STALKER or FallOut, but so far..I can easily say, save yourself the hastle..its nearly impossible to get into the game for those who have not made an account or anything yet
7639	1	a	Spawns in, like 'Wtf is goin' on', gets on car bomb atv and blows up a wall or some crap, spawns in random place with Russians running around asking 'Hey you fat american pig, this is Dota right??'.  - 11/10 Would play again
5183	0	a	1. Wait until game loads.  2. Wait until game loads all the endless updates.  3. Get in game.  4. Run around in tutorial and remove needed stuff by accident before trying to figure out how to get it back.  5. Meet partner in game, only one area available for joining so obviously go there.  6. Get in area, get attacked in first five seconds. Proceed to running around for a bit to explore after getting shot.  7. Realize there is nothing to explore and ride off to the sunset with Cletus just to never return.  Full points, would loot again.
5184	0	a	Hard to follow, Hard to play and hard to control. even worse is the fact that they haven't bothered to add any fighting or damage sounds so half the time you could be getting shot and not even realise!!
5185	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game dont waste your time even if its free
5186	0	a	Fake Fallout online wannabe, Everyone has Bikes and Cars and you are stuck on a goddamm horse. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i'm out.
5187	0	a	Typical Free2Play game
7641	1	a	The biggest downside to this game is its small community. It is a lot like fallout but with a much more explorable open world. Too few players. Give it a try, I't is free and you might like it
5188	0	a	Let me start by saying the game was fun at 1st, but only 3 hours in i felt there was a lack of direction in the game. The missions of fun(for a little bit) but i never felt it was leading up to anything. +, there are so many controls you could just hit some random button and it would probably do something, which is so confusing i just gave up. 5/10
7643	1	a	This game is Kinda good but it is very complicated to start!
5195	0	a	Piece of brown turd with even more shades of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ brown and stiff gameplay. Controls like a nightmare. All I wanted was Fallout 3 MMO &gt;:O
7645	1	a	this game is really good if you like fallout and graphics run on any pc you can get helped bye friends and build camps and weapons   
5202	0	a	Bad graphics, terrible interface, wonky AI, weapons do not have the kick... Do not download it even though it is free, it is a waste of time.
7647	1	a	One of the Better F2p games.  It does have some Pay to win aspects in its cash shop, but dont let that detrack from the really Enjoyable game play, Gritty atmosphere, and the best crafting system in any game, All hidden inside this indi gem.  Till Fallout online hits, this is the best post apocolyptic game on the market!  7/10
7649	1	a	Fallen Earth is very good free to play post apocalyptic MMO. It reminds of Fallout for some odd reason that I can't see to figure out. The world is really well done and the combat is satisfying enough to keep you engaged. If you like post apocalyptic games and MMO's as well this is the game for you.
7651	1	a	Pretty Damn Good
7653	1	a	I certainly like the idea of a fallout like theme where everything is destroyed and so what humans remain alive have created forts and live off what remains of the old world. It's customization is certainly a nice feature. The fact that you can get ' Mounts ' or vehicles is certainly a awesome touch but with the size of the actual map it's clear to see why they are in this.   Since it is free to play there is no harm in giving this ago. I've spent meant hours in game and I do enjoy it and would reccommend it to other's.
7655	1	a	I found lag to be the greatest downer.  Other than that the environment is fully immersive and the storyline extensive; though familiar. You can stay on point and do quests, or venture off and level up in the desert on your own; to a certain degree, in that you'll have to sell loot eventually. After crafting two lawnmower blades into dual-weild weapons I had the most fun.  NOTE:I live in the area it is set in and they got our night sky, the star constellations, right. That's one heck of a detail.
7657	1	a	This game is literally unplayable.
7659	1	a	One of the greatest MMO's currently in the market. I've literally played EVERY AAA MMO out there and this one takes the cake. It might be free but they really know how to keep the fun factor in without having a 'pay me to unlock this feature' screen in your face. I haven't seen any difference between paid players and free players and that's why this game has my utmost respect.  You're a clone that survived the apocalypse. Your old self is dead but you (the clone) are alive. You need to find an antidote to ensure your survival and with that you go through many zones and fight many people/monsters to do it.  The game map is ENORMOUS. It'd literally take you 15 minutes to get from one town to another. There are hundreds of towns in the game. There are also thousands of quests in the game. It is impossible to beat the game within 100 hours as you'll be enticed to explore. You'll find a random bunker in the middle of nowhere and it'll eat at your curiousity. What is it doing there? You step inside and get in an elevator. It takes you down underground (without so much a loading screen, mind you) into a factory filled with mutants. This game is huge in every respect.  You can also craft almost anything and everything you see other players wearing. Every weapon, ammo, horse, car, farm, helmet etc. is craftable. Money is a bit difficult to come by which simulates the real world well.  This game is a MUST PLAY for every hardcore MMO gamer/MMO connoisseur. There is so much to do when you hit the higher levels. It's a sandbox in every respect - as a high-level player you will spend a lot of your time attacking and capturing territory for your faction. As a low level player you will spend a lot of time witnessing the warfare between factions as you level.
7661	1	a	Do not play this game if : 1.You do not want to invest a lot of time 2.You do not want a crafters-dependent economy. 3.You can not stand exploring for many hours. 4.You are addicted to FPS. 5.''OMFG!! FALLOUT RIPOFF''  You will either like it or hate it.This game is not for the many.In any case give it a try..it is free. After 150 hours I am still playing..and haven't even scratched its surface. 
5204	0	a	This is the worst game i hav ever played... waste of bandwidth
7663	1	a	Interesting MMO game produced by GamerFirst Live, this game is really interesting and functionable there are many things that i havent seen yet but some games have the same capability to have same functions.. this game is really based off Fallout: 3 / Fallout: New Vegas.. I have played this game up to 37 level, and also with my other character up to 17.. i started to play this game 2011 so i have experience in this game so yeah i guess il be rating this game 5/5.  Warm Regards, MikeN
7665	1	a	Oh... This game.  This game is worth playing just to see how legendarly bad it is.  In my adventures during this game I made a topless dude in a G string with a pink mohawk with the utmost classy name 'Bondageslave' and trolled so hard that the butthurt admins banned me despite not breaking a single rule. There's not many games that has the potential lulz factor of how bad this game is and even less with butthurt admin, but I assure you the admins here are a breed of their own.  Never have I seen a more raging group of admins on anything. Not even TF2 servers. So yes, I do recommend it. For the wrong reasons? That depends how you look at it. But personally I have never laughed so hard in the 0.9 hrs i've had on this game, untill I got banned.  If you ever get the desire to troll for 0.9 hrs and don't mind installing game that takes roughly 50 minutes to a hour, I assure you that you'll never run across more vulnerable victims.  The game is bad but the lulz is good.
5206	0	a	a discount fallout new vegas [and all the other one's] a wal-mart version, found in a dumpster,or a toilet. or, to simplyfy it, it's equivilent to red faction 2.
7667	1	a	This game takes time and lots of grinding to higher levels, and it is difficult as if you where actually in an apocolypse. This game is very fun if you are able to get past the fact that the story is everywhere and the constant need for better equipment and materials. Though personally if you get a few friends and play through the game it makes things alot more fun for all involved.
7669	1	a	I entered the game and asked where the pros.titutes were, someone soon whispered me telling me to 'go play a more kiddie game like Runescape'.  10/10
7671	1	a	Its pretty goood See for your self.
7673	1	a	A cold apocolypse MMORPG/MMOFPS/MMOTPS Story line is a bit weak and not much refered to it, but that doesn't matter. A lot of weaponry/armor/... Also RolePlay! Give it a shot ;) it's free anyway :)
7675	1	a	This game is amazing. I headed into it completely blind, and i was astounded as to the sheer enormity of it. Every session i play i find a new item or enemy. The game world is so big I havent been out of the first sector yet and im still surprised to the hugeness of it. Plus you get all of this for free.  I love the skill advancement, its non-linear and your are free to spec into anything you want. There are no classes to restrict you, telling you how to play the game. The only classes are the ones you make yourself.
7677	1	a	good game for poor â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ shit dickball anal â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7679	1	a	If you don't have it, get it. 
7681	1	a	I haven't liked most of Steam's F2P games, but I was pleasently surprised with this one, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I love how the game wants you to make your own stuff instead of looting or buying items. You need to scavenge for scrap materials and use other scrap to put together weapons, like a painball gun that fires metal balls. It's a really cool idea. There's still bugs that need ironing out from the Steam release but the game is worth a try, even if it doesn't look that great. It's free, so it's not like you've lost anything.
7683	1	a	After playing this game for 1000+ hours I can finally make a statement.  Pros: - made lots of friends, - had fun for a few weeks,  Cons: - outdated graphics, - juvenile and trolling player base, - balanced PvP? BAH! Forget PvP if you use rifles or pistols. - late game is definietly a money sink. If you don't pay, forget about the Alpha zone or later areas.  Still recommend it as a friend finding application :).  Edit: You can craft grilled prairie chicken. 11/10
7685	1	a	You can collect 'Suspicious Cheese' and 'Questionable Meat'. The epic journey of surviving in a post apocalyptic wasteland by crafting horses.
7687	1	a	This game is so pro i suddenly became a survivalist within 15 minutes
5207	0	a	Having trouble signing in for some reason,I made a account and I cant sign in...Not even with my steam account.wtf
7689	1	a	when i login i cannot play the game it just says type in your password to log in if you knojw how to fix this please tell me
7691	1	a	To tell you all how good this game just know I forgot I even played it until I went to the store page. 10/10.
7693	1	a	i really like this game! top notch if you like the fallout series then this is the game for you! provideing you have a LOT of time spare i have put in over 50 hours and am only level 15 (cap is 55 btw) the map is hugeee literally travelling is my only negative point it takes forever to get anywhere oh and it isnt a p2w   
7695	1	a	Have you ever been playing Fallout? Did you think `Why isnt there a game like this with Multiplayer included?Â´ Well...This game is exactly what you were waiting for. The graphics of Fallen Earth isnÂ´t as good as in Fallout New Vegas, but who cares? You can travel through an area 5 times bigger than that ( I donÂ´t know exactly...maybe 6 or 7 times bigger). The crafting system is the biggest one you have ever seen. It is bigger than in Minecraft! :O. Play it on First Person or Third Person ( Third Person is better ;D ). The best way to enjoy that game is...Play with your friends and enjoy the huge questing system!

7697	1	a	I haven't played this game for ages, i've re - read the description to remind myself of what had happened, it's basically Fallout or DayZ. Imagine the way you do things. A massive roleplaying game awaits.
7699	1	a	= )
7701	1	a	Fun game, can get addicting
7703	1	a	Interesting MMO game produced by GamerFirst Live, this game is really interesting and functionable there are many things that i havent seen yet but some games have the same capability to have same functions.. this game is really based off Fallout: 3 / Fallout: New Vegas.. I have played this game up to 37 level, and also with my other character up to 17.. i started to play this game 2011 so i have experience in this game so yeah i guess il be rating this game 5/5.  Warm Regards, MikeN
7705	1	a	A very good FPS game. Graphics are decent, and the mechanics and skill paths are virtually endless.  My one problem with it, however, has to be the endless grinding involved.
7707	1	a	I like the Game alot and it is a great way to have fun the crafting is top notch and the ability to go threw the world and get items the only thing that bugs me is my lag but thats expected i would give this game 5/5 great game.
7709	1	a	this is like a fallout with an mmo aspect. though to be honest there is a bit of leveling needed to go out there and explore. the crafting system wont seem as bad at first(as there are wait times for crafting items),but when you get to atvs and cars, pop a squat and go play fallout on a console for about 6 hours to see if a peice of your car is finished, or just go to bed, either one.  if they console ported this game, i would play it.   #still better than dayz
7711	1	a	One of the best F2P MMOs i've ever played, i reccomend it. Pros: +Fun to play with friends. +Better PvP because you need to actually aim. +Not P2W Cons: -Not frequently updated -Bugs/ Animations not Completed. 
7713	1	a	I decided to wander and ended up in a different town where a semi-naked guy gave me a duster.  10/10
7715	1	a	This game is extremely addicting and fun, the first few hours are boring but once you get past that this game is AMAZING. Graphics are meh and the combat system is kinda bad, however the simple fact that I can go into a cave mine some coal kill giant ants and underdwellers to find a secret cavern is just awesome. And th MMO part adds so much immersion to the game, know whats more fun than attacking a bandit camp? Attacking it with a group of people. I normally stray away from games like this but I have been playing this bad boy nonstop. Also notice how most of the bad reviews complain about difficulty or buggyness or complicated gameplay yet they haven't played for more than 10 hours? They say some crap like this game is Pay2win, and its not at all, Sure paying gets you some 'new' things faster but you can get most of these things ingame anyway. If you are a realism fan then get this game. Note this game has a big learning curve and difficulty spike.  Now to the problems The enemy AI tends to be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, Enemy's respawn in 1 minute taking away from immersion, for some reason the damage and health system is bad (No joke dogs do 20 Dmg a bite and attack every seconds or so and I've gotton surrounded by em and killed in seconds as the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ take bullets to the head) Stay away from junkyward dogs and gurad dogs is my only tip, The scavenging system can be quite stupid sometimes as well.   Over all this game has +Great gameplay mechanics +Interesting storys and characters +Great immersion +Addictive micro managing +Great trade and communication system  The middle ground Game lacks mercy for new player which can drive people away but not a problem and is more made for intense gamers, not bad but not great graphics.  Now the bad  -Terrible AI -Unhelpful NPC's -Strange level system -Fast enemy respawns  Overall I'd give this game a 8.9/10 
7717	1	a	This is the MMO that I keep coming back to. If you want crafting, questing and sandbox, some would say one cannot go with the other, but it works here. There is also farming, pvp, only in certain spots, but those spots are rich with resources, so there is no griefing the noobs. Also the community is pretty good and the Help channel actually helps. To top it off players moderate the chat and I have seen the ban hammer come down more than once. Yes the interface is clunky, yes the graphics are not AAA, but I love this game and it gives me a sense of accomplishment when I can go out, gather stuff and make myself a shirt. Although its F2P i have played with and without subs and I have not really seen a differance. But for $10 a month you cant go wrong.
7719	1	a	It takes a while to get used to, but you can do many things, graphics are like 'Play Station 1', besides who love building car/ATV's, or battling bots/player's(PVP), join clans......
7721	1	a	Very good game, good gameplay , good graphics. I recommend it.

7725	1	a	Tired of boring shooting while 'locked on target', or bland 'auto aim' and just dull dice rolling for hits? Want to put that aiming in your hand to good use in an MMO? This might be one hell of a post-apocalyptic game for you then. The mounts and vehicles are pretty cool, too. Something different than your run off the mill game.

7733	1	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome!!! i Recommending to everyone to Downlode it, its one of my favorite games i`m playing but for now i have almost 2000 hours on this game and every hour i spent on this game worth it!!!! So guys its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Free 2 Play guys!!!!!!!!!!!
7735	1	a	This game is great! The enemy told me everything I needed to know after forcing him to play this game!
7737	1	a	This game takes time and lots of grinding to higher levels, and it is difficult as if you where actually in an apocolypse. This game is very fun if you are able to get past the fact that the story is everywhere and the constant need for better equipment and materials. Though personally if you get a few friends and play through the game it makes things alot more fun for all involved.
5213	0	a	worst game ever , with the worst gamplay first. 1. low and shity graphics  2.bullcrap story 3.pay 2 win 4.dont waste your time on this peace on crap
7739	1	a	Rough around the edges, but I find that endearing. Solid RPG elements such as character progression, crafting, and skills, nice apocalyptic theme, and good support make this a very enjoyable free2play action RPG. You must give this a try, especially since it's free.
7741	1	a	Fallen Earth is an RPG which offers a wide range of activities. According to me this is one of the best RPG offered in the world of videogames. It's not pay to win and it can also be considered a mix of Fallout and MadMax. Why?. Because it offers a wide map, such as Gran Canyon and veichles are available. You can drive a wide range of veichles such as ATV, motorbikes, choppers, Dune Buggy, sport totally customizable (there are even animals to mount)!. For people who think that it could be pay to win, i am able to tell you that it's not pay to win, you do not have to pay anything to be stronger than other players! There is people who tell that Fallen Earth is dead. This is not true. The number of players is increasing but at the same time some players stop to play because it's a a bit hard as RPG, but do not worry about it, you'll can join a clan which will help you to learn how to play and how to be stronger! Furthermore this game is also playable by players who have a low end PC, so don't worry about FPS.
7743	1	a	 Really good and exquisite gayem 
7745	1	a	Yep, you read it, 1879 hours!  Well, I used to like this game because I could grind and talk to friends at the same time, take over territories, and engage in awesome shootouts (PvP) with up to 20 players or more.  I really got the feeling that I was part of a team and that some people were real helpful with noobs (mainly because of the clan aspect). I had a lot of fun playing this and there are a lot of missions and content. In fact, I am still only 33% of the way through completing the achievements, albiet some of them are unobtainable now.  When the devs were active, they would appear in-game all the time to give away items and be helpful. This was great! Sometimes they would use 'god powers' to be invisible and watch us play new areas that just got released, then make private messages 'I see you!'. - HAH That's great! I met a couple devs that would recognize me and start chatting; even added me to their steam friends list. Pretty cool!  The best experience was on Halloween 3 years in a row where the devs would come out and give away treats (bling for your character). The first year, a dev transformed himself into a giant 4 story tall beast and he ATE ME! HAHAHAHahhaa So the next two years I stood in the mass crowd of online players and typed 'Turn into the beast again!' and sure enough he did, and he ate me again, and everyone started clattering their keyboards to respond. SO GREAT!  But yeah,.. it's just a ghost town now... If more people played, the devs would care again, and this game would once again bring me joy (bugs and all).
5214	0	a	This game is terrible, it crashes every time you look around with the mouse, not the arrow keys. I couldn't get as far as Boneclaw Outskirts until I uninstalled this game after 39 minutes of crashes and little progress. This game needs a major update before I will try it again. Please fix the issues, and I may try it again. -Iraphoen
7747	1	a	Before I start, let me say, yes this game isn't as good as it could be!  But it could be worse. To start, some of the major flaws are visable from the get go, lack of character slots, you want more then one character, buy slots, this itself is a huge turn off, and makes it seem like a demo for a pay once to play MMO. This honestly detered me from playing, but I decided to press on to see if it got better, and it did.....some what. While the skill system takes a moment to learn due to it's unfreindly new user interface, it's well designed once you get the hang of how it works.  The crafting systemis superb, while it is long, and a lot of the crafting times are broken, meaning they take more or less then what it says it will, only those who are really in to crafting will actually make use of this. All crafting skills have purpose, if you seek to play a more support role, medical and cooking skills will be of the most use to you. want a role to inflict maximum damage, science, ballistics and possibly nature (whick could also be put under support) would be a good suit for you. You can buy slots to have the ability to craft multiple items at once, and buy a device to speed up the crafting times all together. What more, the device can be bought from other players in game.  The ability to create camps, and material generaters gives this mmo a unique feel to it, making it seem more like a sand box game then an mmo. But this is also it's downfall, because it seem it can't decide if it wants to be an MMO or sandbox game, the AI seems unfinished and buggy, audio clips break at times, and enemy AI is flat out broken. But the broken enemy AI may also have been done on purpose, as even something one or two levels higher then you can easily come close to killing you, if you're not swarmed that is. Therefor, it's better to travel out in teams so you're not caught in a fray alone. Yes this game is Pay to Win, yes it has a lot of bugs and could be considered still in beta, but this game has merit, and tried to do something different.  If I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 8/10 something worth keeping regaurdless of the playerbase or cons, as this game could be easily fixed.
5215	0	a	The Pics they show make it look way batter then it is i play very little abd i hated it its a very bad game  one thing more the chikens well sopose to be chikens look like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.... i hate this game and shiver to see it......
7749	1	a	If you like crafting then this game has it! Very indepth with a variety of crafting paths to choose from. The game itself maybe alittle dated but a fun time will be had by all.
7751	1	a	The only post apocalyptic MMO that I know of, Fallen Earth is unique in the gaming landscape. The game is something like Gamma World meets Mad Max, but also with a Western theme. The game has an indie budget and look but has some enjoyable game play. This is the only game that I know of in which your character can ride a giant mutant chicken as a mount. With more resources, Fallen Earth could gain a larger player base and compete against more prominent MMOs.
7753	1	a	this is a very fun game remindes me of fallout and is sweet for a free to play
7755	1	a	makes me want to do heroin and become a lesbian  10/10
7757	1	a	I recommend playing this game if you like to kill things 
7759	1	a	Meh okay repedative but overall fun
5218	0	a	Got bored quickly, crashed a lot, the game felt dull, broken and not worth the time spent looking at it...  Now, 4 years later, it's still where I left it... So I will leave it to die in peace.
7761	1	a	good game look like Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 but More fun....... The difference between fallout and fallen earth..... her you can play withe other player do your mission and you can rid a car are a horse for your mission Instead of walking in fallout to your mission   how love fallout i recommended to play this game it will be a good challenge    
7763	1	a	Post-Apocalyptic MMO . . can't get any better then this. A bit slow to level but good world size.
7765	1	a	This game is awesome. It is a great play if you're willing to put some hours into it.
7767	1	a	Very entertaining, good amount of quests, easy to log in, play and log out for quick runs.
5219	0	a	looks amazing first 5 minutes then u say â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it.
7769	1	a	Its a good game for you fallout fans its the same story basicly but divided by sectors. it is fully multiplayer just amazing
7771	1	a	This is the type of game I have been wanting to play for a very long time. They could use some help with marketing considering that this game has already been out awhile and I have never heard of it. It meshes a lot of your favorite sci-fi genre classics and still has enough original content to keep me interested.
5220	0	a	Couldn't even get into the game due to a very broken sign in system.
7773	1	a	Best Apocalypse Sandbox MMO out there ... oh and it's Free 2 Play !
7775	1	a	this is bs i cant play this so i say its a 0/10
7777	1	a	I highly recommend this game to people who love roleplaying
7779	1	a	Fallen Earth, in my opinion, is one the best MMOs I've played; the community is very helpful when needed and the GMs keep the help section of the chat regulated and reduce spam as much as possible. There are a total of 55 player levels as of now, im only level 30 so I havent really seen everything, but from what I have experienced, a very enjoyable game.    For me, the one biggest problem is definitely the client-to-client synchronization. Players may look as if they are in a position, but really they may not be there. You may also see NPCs glide across the screen due to the synchronization being terrible, but it has improved a bit. In the beginning, you start off with an axe, two knives, and three pellet guns (one being an air rifle and the other two being pistols). After about two or three of the beginning missions, you are awarded a horse for basic transportation, but as you progress further into the game, you get other mounts/vehicles. The basic vehicles are: ATVs, Motorcycles, Dune Buggies, and Interceptor Speedsters (basic cars). Each vehicle has many different variations that you can craft.    The crafting system isnt too complex, but it can be very slow; vehicles can take up to a few days to fully craft from raw materials, but smaller items, such as ammunition, can take a few minutes. If crafting isnt your thing, then there is also an auction house in almost every city; here you can buy player-listed items for how ever much the player lists the item for.    If youre someone who absolutely has to have good graphics, then you may not be too fond of this game; the graphics are pretty bad, but that shouldnt really be too big of a deal if you dont mind it. There are also limits to free to play players however, but they can easily be negated by purchasing any single item from the game's market place. The only limitations i am aware of are a limit to how many chips you can have (currency), a character limit of only one character and no access to the Global chats, but there may be more. In my opinion, its definitely worth it to go 'freemium' by just buying a really cheap item from the store, or by purchasing the Survivalist Package that is offered by Steam. I believe that the limit to the amount of chips you can have if you are free to play is about 100,000 chips. This would be 10 red chips and each red chip is 10,000 chips. Chips go by: Yellow&gt;Red&gt;Blue&gt;White. Blue is 100 white, Red is 100 Blue and Yellow is 100 Red.    There is a total of six different sectors in the game (The entire province is huge, roughly 83km by 83km, according to the Wiki) which all have different fast travel locations that you must first travel to via mount/vehicle. The game also encourages palyers to use roadways with vehicles as they provide a 'boost' and significantly increase your speed. There are also six major factions you can choose to be a part of once you reach Sector 2: The Techs, The Enforcers, Travelers, The Lighbearers, The Vistas, and The CHOTA. Each faction provides unique equipment that you cannot use unless you have a certain reputation with the appropriate faction.   All in all, a very enjoyable game that will last a while if you can dedicate yourself to playing.
5226	0	a	it isnt really free. when i downloaded it it just made me make an account for some other game engine. it also dowloads other things that arent even associated to it. do not get this game!
7781	1	a	This game is by far one of the more enjoyable post apocalyptic mmorpg's combat is fun and interesting, the stat system is simple yet complex as you can choose what you want to be able to do in the game making it a unique experience for each indivual player. All in all a fun game to play either alone but more fun if you can get a group together making encounter's much easier.
7783	1	a	I love Fallout. Well, I loved Fallout 3. I didnt get into the others so much but the post nuclear/disaster/world gone to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ scenario called out to me. When I first stumbgled into this game in 2009 I was overjoyed that someone had the brains to bring the MMO world a new change. One that didn't invole swords or spells or people running around yelling ' you're not holding the aggro ya nooob'.  Thats what this game is. Simply put it's the best MMO I have ever played. Quite string terminology I know but let me tell you why.   Moderated help chat. This is a key in any game that people are new to and I think should be a staple in ANY MMO. The GM's are friendly but also help you when you need it.   Crafting. I have honestly never played a game with better crafting. Literally everything you can think of can be made. Want a shirt? Craft it. Need new shoes or pants? Craft them. I've heard some people say SWG had the best crafting system but I didnt play it so I cant comment.  The classless system. This in my book is a bonus. You can be whoever you want. Want a guy that beats the crap out of things with a 2x4 and shoots pistols? Thats ok. A lot of people get confused by now having a rigid class to stick to but I think its a breath of fresh air.   Ok so the graphics might be a bit outdated and theres constant bugs but the heart is there. Not many people are playing it these days but theres still enough people to make a game out of it. My only dissapointment is that Icarus studios sold it. A lot of people grumbled about the micro tranasctions but in my opinion you either buy them or you dont.  Anyways if you like fallout then I think you should enjoy this. Plus its free to play now so if you dont like it it wont cost you anything :) Its the closest to the fallout MMO your going to get for a while.  
7785	1	a	Really great game.I don't see why people are complaining about the graphics.I like them actually.Gameplay is a bit diffficult to get the hang up at first,but it catches.Still kind of strange how you need to hold right click to change your view while not in aiming mode.But,I digress.Still a really great game.9/10.Just wish that some of the missions were straightforward,telling you exactly what you have to do,and being a bit more simple,instead of multiple paragraph essays.Still,really fun game.

7789	1	a	Its like fallout but Free
7791	1	a	its just too bad there isnt enough people playing this game. thats what kind of killed it for me. felt like I was playing single player lol. Aside from that, pretty awesome game. I may or may not come back to it.
7793	1	a	nice game fun stuff and the good stuffssssss
7795	1	a	This game is not bad bad by any means, but it's not Fallout. If you found this and are hoping for a Fallout-MMO, then you'd be sadly mistaken. I haven't spent much time on this game, mainly because it's a bit tedious to actually get started playing it. If you have some free time, and you're looking for a new game to try out then go ahead and download this one. I feel that once you start progressing into the game, it just continues to get better and better as you go. I give Fallen Earth a 7/10.
7797	1	a	Back when i first played this game, I had a ton of fun. Never thought i'd be into MMORPGS.
7799	1	a	yes i wood recommend this game its fun but the grinding sistom needs to get fixed and the leveling the game has lots of fun the game needs to get updated tho and like i sed thay need to make grinding skills ezeyer and the narmal grinding to but yea the game has lots of players cool items lots of quests lots of mounts to use and huge maps i cant see why some pepole say mean things about the game and no good things
7801	1	a	When I first started this game, I was expecting my computer to not be able to run it from the images. Luckily, the game ran a scan of my computer and optimized it for my computer and I run at max FPS. It is Fallout Online which I love. My issues with the game are that the graphics are not as beautiful as I would like but it is incredible for when it was released back in like 2008. When I start up the launcher and try to launch it, it will either tell me I cannot connect to internet (which is usually true) or that the server is having an issue, and also, lets not forget, this is a game where you are asked to upgrade but you do not need to, it is a one time request. However, disregarding the graphics, age, upgrading, and techincal issues, it does everything masterfully. You can craft and it is not instantly created, making it more realistic, you get a vehicle (horse) from the very beginning so you don't have to walk all over the Grand Canyon. You get a speed boost when you ride on the main roads, you can roleplay and go killing other players who are in PvP mode. I recommend it to anyone who loves Fallout and is dying to play it online with people.

5230	0	a	Horrible just flat out horrible. Tried this game when it first came out and you could only play the first few mins then you were stuck in a room going nowhere cause they wanted you to play to play. Gave it another go a week agaon and holy crap it sucks. Not sure how it got a Metacritic score of 71, but dont waste your time on this one.

7809	1	a	This game has been out for a while, and, compared to other currently active MMOs, Fallen Earth does fairly well.  If you like the post-apocalpytic theme, crafting a variety of items, shooter action-rpgs, and playing with others, you should enjoy this one.  The aesthetics are pretty good, the equip-able armor and weapons are all visible on your character. The music and sounds are decent.   The controls are easy to familiarize yourself and, like most MMOs, the beginning tutorial is extremely helpful in establishing your bearings in the game world. The learning curve is moderate to challenging, depending on how familiar you are with MMORPGs and their mechanics.  Crafting is a very fun part of this game if you are into that - you can craft almost anything you see in the game world (which beats having to spend your resources on merchants. Within the first 2 hours I already was driving around in my own ATV. The gameplay is pretty good, however, it still remains fairly buggy in many areas. The AI has godlike sensors, able to detect and chase you across the map once you have aggro'd (hostile interaction) them.   Grinding in this game is actually pretty fun considering that the rewards are very reasonable and the variety in missions is very, very good - they aren't 90% fetch or find quests typical of many MMORPGs. Combat can be weird and clunky at times, and hopefully this will be improved, however, it has been a long time and these problems still remain.  If you can look past these bugs, and enjoy grinding and crafting in the post-apocalyptic setting, then give this game a try.   Recommend.
7811	1	a	They Basicly made this game for welfare bums that can't afford any FALLOUT GAMES.Fallout earth is a game about lag switching.And stealing from as many hardworking clans as you can...Gotta survive out in the wasteland.And pretend you're A girl so people give you free items and they can't kill you.
5233	0	a	u have to go through sooo many stuff to just play it and its not even fun horible game who ever made this has no idea wat there doing
5234	0	a	Since this game is available on steam, you'd think you wouldn't have to set up another account with some other game site to play this.

5237	0	a	trash game lol i made a character named 'dog tounge tribal leader' i met up with my friend 'onion bread' and we basically â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed off for a couple of hours. After finding out that crafting is a day-long process in real time, (legit some stuff takes 30 minutes + to craft) yeah it sucks :( also third party acccount or sum â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like that.
7817	1	a	For a free to play game this is worth a look, it has a nice feel about it, and a good starting story, would suit the causal gamer and is quite easy to get ito, controls could use a tidy up, but over all for an 'Alpha' not a bad place to start, pleanty of missions and a good crafting system that is easy to use for noobs Great exprence if you havent played a mmo before, this one is quite forgiving unlike Dayz
7819	1	a	i love this game sooooooo much!!!! best game EVER
5239	0	a	Edit: I've got a decent computer so more thoughts on the game are at the very bottom  Similar to APB Reloaded, only that it crashes instead of giving me huge framerate issues, it has many graphical glitches which lead to framerate issues.  I found myself trying really hard to enjoy this game because it's basically a multiplayer version of Fallout, Match made in heaven, right? But it simply just doesn't work at all. All the times I tried to play it, it crashed my computer, even while I was playing on the lowest settings! and to top it all off: these weren't even regular crashes, these were BLUE SCREENS! on WINDOWS 7! I didn't even know these existed on modern systems!   Don't play this game, it has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ compatibility.  So, I played the game for a while, it looks sloppy and ugly even on the highest settings, the animations and models look so old and dated. Also the aiming is weird in this game, I'm used to my aim not completely following my crosshair, and instead hitting where the animation plays, which is not how melee works in this game.  So, if you were to attack something with a melee weapon, it may look like you hit it but you haven't, and same thing in reverse. Speaking of combat, you cannot hit NPCs which are too far away (even though it looks like you do, blood and dust does show, but their health bars do not deplete) I can understand this was done to prevent people doing this to players, but come on. NPCs. Seriously.  It's also very boring, but I'll have to give credit for making the game semi-straight forward. Still not worth downloading.
7821	1	a	pretty good game wish more users
7823	1	a	Great game, Nearly everything i wanted out of a multiplayer Fallout-all its missing the loot what the enemy is wearing and leave thier naked bodies on the side of the road.
5245	0	a	This is honestly only good if you can settle for a crap version of fallout.
7825	1	a	The title has nothing to do with the earth falling through space
7827	1	a	This game is unique, and the best FREE MMO Post Apocalyptic Game there is in my opinion.  What can you do in it ?: well alot of things. you have a huge in game map to go where ever you want and explore and not Just one map but a bunch of them. it is A PvE And PvP game so you wont lack any action of killing other people and ofc Those that feel blood is not for them got nothing to be scared off they can just stay away of the PvP area's You can Craft Alot of things ! (Alot of em) from small things such as ammo and up too cars and horses or wapons. you wont get bored Trust me on that. And now for the part that makes it Stand out from the rest of the MMO games is that it got an incredible Stable currency at the Aucation unlike any other MMO's wich there currency at market places/Aucation houses is Ridiculous To say the least. this game is perfect for people who look for that Apocalyptic game in wich they free to do What they want and go where they want (its best to play with friends) there are factions wich fight each other over Points of control on the map Did i say that this game is not a Pay To Win Game ?! Hell yeah you dont have to pay money Just to be able to even have a chance vs someone who did pay for the dlc for an example (Winterfall) to all of those who Say it is too hard to get chips in the game (the in game money) all you have to do is go to the Aucation house see what is In high demand and figure out the best way to get it and sell it after you do that a few times you can go to just Buy at low Cost and sell at higher prise to make profit* (My Tip is for free ^_^ ).  Now it is true that this game is not as popular as it was a few years ago and in my opinion it is sad and pity. for such a Game to go to waste because of people crying about how hard it is or complain about some small bugs well i have news For you there are no games with no bugs. we are all humans and we make mistakes and im sure that even now there Team is working hard to fix them all. And since its a FREE TO PLAY GAME i dont think anyone got the right to criticize the Team for being lazy for maintaining a FREE TO PLAY game.
5249	0	a	Was a great game but gamers first killed it wiith bad updates :(
5250	0	a	Was a great game but gamers first killed it wiith bad updates :(
7829	1	a	WHY ARE U READING THIS GET THE GAME ALREADY ITS FUN
5252	0	a	This game is insanely bad, i downloaded it because the pictures on steam made it look fun and an open world mmo, it is the exact opposite. all of the missions have bugs in them. if you looking for a survival game go download dayz. because this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible. i wouldnt even waste my time downloading it if i were you
7831	1	a	Awsome game !
5253	0	a	Controls weren't fluid at all and felt akward, Crafting system wasn't player friendly, and Nothing was very clear on what the goal was.
5254	0	a	The Trailer video is a lie. The graphics sucks.
7833	1	a	Fun for awhile. Boring after a while. Played with friends 2 hours in total and got deeply anoid with how this game plays out  5/10 Meh gameplay. Fun for teamplayers
5256	0	a	This game fricken sucks this game makes me mad, it represtents fault and a whole lotta lagg, Im sorry but its true I did not like fallen earth.  (sing)
5257	0	a	Terribly dissapointed with the gameplay and graphics after many hours of downloading it was a bitter pill to swallow. This game is not for me.
7835	1	a	This game it cool and if you like post-apocalyptic game this is for you i playd it and i like it  have a nice day playing :3
7837	1	a	I would recommend this game mainly because of the great crafting systems it has and is more, 'Oh, you want this? well too bad, either go make it your self or have a tech build it for you.' That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try. I also see alot of peopel complaining of slow download times and game crashes, i never had the game crash on me at all and got this thing done downloaded and playing in under 30 minutes, which for me is fast. Another thing Fallen earth does that i like is the fact you can either be in 3rd person or 1st, i for one enjoy it in first person, but to each there own i guess.
5268	0	a	it SUCKS it took my like 3 hoursto play and it isnt even good
7839	1	a	pretty good i rate it a 7.6/10
7841	1	a	Nice simple apocolyptic game. Few small kinks but I'm sure with few patches and graphics update will look really nice in the long run.
7843	1	a	I was there at start before the layoff when everyone got to eat their contract and was told to walk. The skelton crew that followed and the people who tried to keep it together (sorry Tiggs) just couldn't do more than bandage the wound. Was an awesome idea and I loved what it could have been but it's over. The company who owns it now isn't even the original one because they gave up on it and essential bugs that needed to be addressed never will as the only people who really understood it were fired early in a bid to get what little cash they could. My guess is the company that now holds it is just doing the same thing, trying to get some random subs before dropping it too. RIP Fallen Earth and thanks for the few good memories there were.
7845	1	a	Finding this oddly addicting,  looking forward to future development 
7847	1	a	After playing this game on and off since 2012 (and not using the steam launcher as much as I could cos it chugged the game for me for soem reason) I have to say teh game is dieing.   The gameplay itself is a blast and you will have fun for the first 15-20 levels, I can promise you that. The graphics are good,, though not amazing, the crafting system is one of teh best I've seen in an MMO that is not Eve Online, it does the whole real time crafting thing real well. The community has always been pretty toxic when you step into the PvP aspects oft eh game but that is to be expected as some people have grudges with others that span years now or they simply hate a faction regardless of who is on it (there are 6 total factions though now a days they do not matter due to low player count in game and removal of faction based bonuses, the only advantage now is the armor cosmetics and which faction chat your can talk in). The PvE community however is prettygood and open to help people.  Now the bad. G1G (the company that bought FE from Icarus Studios) have been doing the minimal to keep the game ticking over and making money. The game was meant to be spread over 9 total zones and having an in depth and intriguing plot and story line. When G1G bought the game I belive 4 of the zones where done (don't get me wrong the zones in this game are HUGE and pretty well detailed). Now since 2012 to now, only 1 of the new zones has been added and it's one totally thought up by G1G and has practically zero addition to game play. It is effectively a mix of 2 zones or 2 parts of 2 zones I should say, saying that it does look good, it just has no body or soul, it's just that, looks and some newarea to grind in to get a new tier of gear. It's nice however it took over a year to finish and just looks like a rehash.  Now another thing that is a MAJOR killer in this game is MASSIVE CONSTANT LAG. I'm not kidding when I say if your playing early morning in the US or late at night in the US, you will have in game lag whenever you go to loot a body (1-10 seconds to loot where normally it's instant) or if you gather a resource node. It also happens in the chat with 1-5 second lag between hitting enter and the post appearing, if it appears at all (I've had messages just go into the ether and no, not muted or anything, just parts of a convo just never get delivered). These problems result in G1G having to restart the servers at least once a day where they have to take them down for up to 90 minutes, sometimes longer, just so the game doesnt crash.  Now saying all that I must say give the game a shot, it is a good game and the latency issues are newish...well month or two of it happening every day, butif you love post apoc games and just want to drive around mad max style in a car or beaten up dune buggy with a 50 cal on the roof, this is the game for you. It just sucks how most people don't give it a good run past level 20 as at 40+ (level 55 is max level currently) is where it starts to open up and give you freedom to do whateer you want.
7849	1	a	Pretty nice game without bugs but got serious in upgrading quality and communication with people there. Final score 6.5
7851	1	a	I would recommend this game mainly because of the great crafting systems it has and is more, 'Oh, you want this? well too bad, either go make it your self or have a tech build it for you.' That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try.

7853	1	a	well... this game is not as bad as it seems to be. and certainly this is not the worst free 2 play game you've ever faced
7855	1	a	This game is fun, especialy for those how like post apocalyptic survival kinda games. You basicly go around doing missions from npcs and craft weapons, armor, vichles, etc. Theres alot of wierd creatures in the world that you can kill and harvest after, moast of them are mutants or npc bandits.  Don't wory about getting killed and losing your stuff because moast of the map is pve, but you still have to whatch out for agressive npcs. The ones you enconter in the first town are quite weack but every town you go to the npcs are stronger and cooler, so i advise you to craft the best armor and weapons possible in every town you go.  Over all it's a really fun game and will entertain you until you get bored of it and find a new one. Because has we all know thats how games work.
7857	1	a	I wonder how many hours its gonna take me to get to level 55
7859	1	a	Fallen Earth is an MMORPG game with the Post-Apocaliptic theme. You can either play in first person , either in third person ... But in first person you can only fight. Its OK for my taste. Its free . Its good for MMORPG lovers . I recommend it.
7861	1	a	I've never played this but steam says I have so here is my review. This game is playable. (i think)
5269	0	a	Avoid this game and it's power triping GMs like the one known as Radash who will mute/ban someone for asking a simple question in the help chat.
5270	0	a	I came, I saw, I uninstalled.  Though you CAN shoot from horseback, so there's that.
7863	1	a	OMG! Guys if you like Post-Appocolyptic things then this is your game. It is so fun with real plays even though there is still NPC's and Mobs. It has missions to do and the XP to rank up to lvl 55! Now i know some people might say that, 'are you kidding? lvl 55 will take forever!' But seriously not, I've played this game for a month and got to lvl 55 and to do so all you have to do is kill loot and sell and get a good clan to get some new friends and hang out in the Wasteland. It has all kinds of cool looking armor and weapons but here ammo can become scarce sometimes if you dont watch how much u have. BUt anyway I would want all you appocolypse fans to play this it is realy worth the download.
7865	1	a	try it before you buy it
5271	0	a	Um.. Where to even begin....    Pros;   -Free -Easy to learn -Good for teaching / good first game to get into if youre trying to learn how to games -Doesnt take up much space -Runs really well / Isnt CPU nor GPU sensitive      Cons;  -Poor/Uninteresting/Generic Story -Looks like... Well, Pixel games are better. -Extremely repetitive/boring gameplay. -Enemies have the skill and threat of a one legged kangaroo. -Theres only like... One of each type of gun. (Im serious...) -PayToEnjoy.
5272	0	a	This is a terrible and boring game. Full of Hackers and annoying bugs.   Ignore this game and go play Fallout or something.
5273	0	a	10/10 Would uninstall again!
5274	0	a	Lets see, Corrupt Developers/Game Masters, 90% cheaters, this game is high NOT recommended!
7867	1	a	Nothing says apocalypse like a chick running around in a thong ;D
5278	0	a	too much lagg and it take at least 2 and a half hours to download if lucky plus another 3 to get the updates required than every once in a while while its updating itll crash so all and all this game is a P.O.S!!!!!!!! &gt;:( waste of space and i could've been playing 3 other games that r better and dont take as long to download whoever invented this game needs to fix the bugs and stop doing a P.O.S job on games like this all I have to say is you are so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lucky this didnt cost money of so help me god, well hopefully you got fired for making this P.O.S!!! thanks for wasting my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing day waiting for this garbage
5279	0	a	The game is all right I suppose. It is an open world game that is based around the Fallout series. Though Fallen Earth is a much more boring experience in my opinion. When I finished the tutorial, the beginning video made the game look bigger than it actually was. The graphics are terrible and the HUD was just all over the place. It was too lagy, and even on the lowest graphics settings possible for my computer. I do not recommend this game.
5280	0	a	Hmm, Hmm , yeah well this game looks cool at first but uhh yeah you have to create a account on another website, which costs  money/and,or/wasting  time watching adds to get so-called 'credits' . complete waste of time considering its free on steam, but you cant even play it unless you go through this second rate gaming site and give them money so you can play this game and get bored after 4 hours TOTAL of gameplay . Honeslty im not poor , i have money, i just wish it wouldn't be under free-to-play cause ITS NOT FREE-TO-PLAY!!!! 0 freakin' stars out of five .
5281	0	a	This game gave me cancer
5282	0	a	I cannot comment on the actual game play because the game doesn't work. It keeps getting stuck on downloading updates and its stuck on a loop. After it downloads the updates, it restarts again and again.
5283	0	a	The graphics are terrible. Now, this wouldnt be so bad if its 2014 and the gameplay trailer had amazing graphics. At least with WoW they made the game a long time ago so its an excuse to not have good graphics, but this? But what is worse is the launcher. It took me 3 DAYS to download this dissapointment. To put that in perspective. I downloaded GTA 5, which is 16 gbs in 1 day. Fix your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The gameplay is clunky and the instructions are unclear. The first person mode is glitchy as all hell, and I could barely walk to the other towns without some high level destroying me. The story looks like it was pulled out of a toddlers imagination and turned into a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ vampire love story for teens. Also, the map is big. And I'm not saying this is bad, its just that the map is WAY TOO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BIG. It breaks the gameplay and is so boring when I have to walk for 45 minutes just to complete a mission. I may have not played a lot, but I played enough.  Overall, this game is a big, dissapointing pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 3d models and bad voice acting, peppered with bad camera angles and broken game mechanics. 2/10.
5284	0	a	Isnt as good as it looks.
5285	0	a	Don't download unless you are willing to wait hours upon hours dowloaing it. Then waiting more hours downloading an update when you want to play.
7869	1	a	its great guys
5293	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. I tried to do a mission and it said to make bullets i had the materials but I couldnt craft it.It turns out you have to find teh blue print this quest is one the of the beggining ones.
7871	1	a	I loved this game, it's just so addicting! The only problem I have withit is the ocasional lag. But besides that it's fun!
5296	0	a	I want to play this game but it said i need to make an acount and i downloaded all the stuff ,ran it, and it wouldn't work i ran game like fifteen times and it said creat a acount again and agian and the some thing over and over.
5297	0	a	If you usually rebind game controls in order to play things... have fun with this.
5298	0	a	Fallen Earth is the story of a really awesome idea getting destroyed by poor presentation, horrible gameplay, and just making a great example an how not to make a MMORPG. The story is sort of simple, you are a clone and stuff happened and then other stuff happened and now you are in the open (after a 20 min tutorial). I'm being for real I didn't know what was going on the entire time. The dialouge is horrendous which becomes a problem since thats how you get both important information and quests. Even though it's free it's not worth your time.
7873	1	a	Amazing apocalyptic world based on MMORPG system which has Quests, Towns, Missions, Vehicles, Pets, Crafting, Looting, Many skills such as constructions, biology, geology, armorcraft, ballistics and so much more!
7875	1	a	Excelent game if you have a group, not so much without one. yet i can still say it was enjoyable to play, at least for me. i was looking for a post apocaliptic mmo that is what i found so i was satisfied, did i mention it was free? (well free-ish, there are still microtransactions) recommend playing in a group of at least 2-3 people
7877	1	a	It's a good game.
7879	1	a	This game is cool for time consuming but it does have some realy bad bugs like on the first mission i finshied the mission and i couldnt take another one.
5300	0	a	I don't write reviews...at all but the hell this game gave me for the first 20 minutes was pure HELL. First, i spawn in the clone room as usual and proceed with the tutorial. The problems started when i attempted to complete the first kill task, I start the fight to only notice there's no sound. No ax swings, swooshes, GAAAHHH, nothing. So after this, I shrug it off as a small glitch that's in every f2p. I get to the point where you aquire the sniper where thereis again no sound; this annoys me so i decide to exit and search online for a fix (It was simple) so i relaunch it ( did i fail to mention each launch took about 4-5 minutes?) and rejoin where my progress last took place (one pro i found). There was sound, scratchy but there. I start the 'kill the sniper' objective only to find I once again have no sound. Oh but it dosent end there; I have a 40 degree pov, couldn't move (almost like i was stuck in the floor or wall) and couldn't see the snipers. I couldn't advance any further so I said â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this (20 minutes or so later) and decided to write a review.
5301	0	a	just sad cannot get game to open been at it for a while unistalling and re installing. attempted to get tech support and it was like standing in a desolate canon to only here my own echos. i have searched firewalls, check my port forwarding and even defraged the game. but to no satisfaction. I am unable to recommend this game or not recomend this gaem do to i cannot even play it. oh well i guess i will go spend my moneys somewhere else. to those who can play the game i hope it is funa nad entertaining.
7881	1	a	Truthfully, I had a great time with this game. Sure it had that lingering Pay to Win idea on it, but you could do okay without paying a cent. While this game has been replaced with Fallout, I can't take it out of my library simply due to its nostalgia factor it has.
7883	1	a	This game is a very fun game to play despite a few glitches sometimes but I would definately recommend this! &lt;3
7885	1	a	Online Fallout New Vegas....Confusing at first but exciting once you get the hang of it.
5302	0	a	Great concept, bad asthetics and worse mechanics. Extremely dissapointed.
7887	1	a	This game is put together very well. The updates always add more fun to the overall experience.
7889	1	a	I only played this game briefly, but it was fun. It did, however, have a steep learnin curve, and not much was explained, so it left a beginning player a bit confused and wandering around a bit. I have not played it in many months, however, so patching and the like may have fixed many of those problems. If you like the post apoc or survival genres, it's definitely worth checking out, especially with its (free) pricetag.
5306	0	a	Has allot of potential. Devs don't give enough attention to it though in the areas that it needs large amounts of improvement. My main complaint isn't the fighting physics (while they aren't very good, being that you select a monster/person and just let your character hit them over and over again on their own, think world of warcraft in a free2play game) but instead the hook to come back and play more. I just simply couldn't get immersed in the gameplay, it lacked a good storyline, and instead gave out shi tty quests as a way to waste your time. Upgrades are disgustingly expensive, leveling up takes forever, and pvp isn't even under discussion. Plain and simple, imho, its a bad game. But hey, it's free, don't listen to some dipsh its comment you read on steam reviews. Download it and try it yourself, it only took like 2-3 hours.
5307	0	a	Stupid but its ok if you like this kind of stuff
7891	1	a	This is a very fun game i enjoyed it so far and this is nothing like fallout if think that you can die
5313	0	a	WHAT A PIECE OF DOGSHIT! Don't even try it!!!!! NEVER!!|||||||||||||
7893	1	a	Its an okay game once you figure out what you're doing.
7895	1	a	This game is excellent. It was my first online game to play and though I dont play enough i think it is a great way to be introduced to online gaming. Sadly their are some bugs and problems with lag but these are only minor. Try this game and i am sure you will like!
5315	0	a	I downloaded it longer then i played it.....crit. 14/10
5316	0	a	hi i tried this out and... yeah game isnt that good i tried it out the opening is WTF? story meh.... wait if eleena said i cant regenarate anymore then how the hell when i died i got back to life? and gameplay is OK its just like fallout but with bad story line worse gameplay unrealstic futurstic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game 3/10 seen better
7897	1	a	its a good game just needs some minor tuning
7899	1	a	this game is cool and free:)))
7901	1	a	Best free to play out there, tons of stuff to do.  The combat system is simple, but you get what you pay for.
5317	0	a	never play
5318	0	a	i know i have no play time for this game but that is exactly why im writing this review. let me start from the begining, i wait 2 days for this game to download(slow internet) and its done so i start the game and it asks me to create a account so i go and fill in all the required stuff and wait for the verification email, get the email and open link, then i get a error, this page cannot be found, so i redo it again and same problem, tried at least 4 times, keep getting the same error. now i see why it has so many negative reviews
7903	1	a	yes this game is fun but it would be better with a group of friends then you can work together and just have a better playing experience
7905	1	a	Detroit, Detroit never changes.  This game is a simulation of the aftermath of the collapse of Detroit. As you roam the streets and search for other sane denizens of downtown Detroit, you will encounter many vile mutant hobos, street gangs, feral dogs and even the fabled Detroit Lawnmower gang, who truly are a formidable foe. As you fight to keep your sanity in the streets of Detroit you will uncover its darkest secrets. Detroit is a dangerous place, children, remember to pack your gasmask because Detroit's atmosphere is toxic due to the large amount of drug and automobile use. The number one way to survive this harsh enviroment is to do the Detroit shuffle, I know that this might seem to be a difficult task at first but once you've done it, you'll never forget. Detroit truly is a dangerous place. Overall this Detroit simulation is good, it sums up the trials and tribulations of downtown Detroit perfectly. The weapons are a perfect representation of what one will find in the dark corners of Detroit. The only con to this game is that there is not enough Detroit, as one can never have enough Detroit. Overall, this game is good. If you are looking for a good Detroit simulator then this is the game for you.  10/10 -Detroit Remember kids; when in trouble, do the Detroit shuffle.  
7907	1	a	Pretty fun, especially since it's free, I haven't played it in ages but I have fond memories of roaming the lands with my friend, we did quests, got loot, pretended to be hobos living in dumpsters, untill we found an empty building and used that as a house, that was pretty fun. For a Free to Play game it's quite easy to advance without buying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, infact, I got myself an ATV, full set of decent armor, 2 pistols, ammo and pleanty of weapons, I even went on raids with some friends I met through a clan. Just thinking about all this makes me feel kind of sad, sad that I haven't played it in ages, and those firends have left, never to be seen again. The gameplay is pretty grindy, but advancing and getting better gear is very rewarding and the game world is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING HUGE HOLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I once set out on my horse, travelled the lands for abut 3 hours straight, I ended up in some huge rusty old town, I have no clue if I will ever find the town I first set out in ever again. Infact, just writing this review makes me want to go play the game again actually I think I'll do that.
5321	0	a	bullet sponge yet boring enemies+boring world+boring story+extremely small variety of everything+terribly done shooter= Terrible game! would not consider paying for/10 literally a 0/10, would not play again.
7909	1	a	yup. i recommend it
5322	0	a	Boring, doesnt save correctly
7911	1	a	Sometimes I feel really sad and I just do not know what to do. I typically just go home and strip down to my socks and cradle back in forth in the fetal position. Playing this game has stopped me from doing this, and I am berry grateful. Thanks Shrek.
5324	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. I tried to do a mission and it said to make bullets i had the materials but I couldnt craft it.It turns out you have to find teh blue print this quest is one the of the beggining ones.
7913	1	a	I enjoyed Fallen Earth, but there is a lot to this game that makes me cringe. The crafting times get ridiculous, you don't get much help from the Help chat (if anything you just get extremely annoyed by the noobs asking how to ride a horse), the GM's act like punks as well as most other players, some enemies might be a little overpowered and may require you to bring friends, which are hard to acquire if you aren't lucky, and I guess you're not allowed to hold a ton of chips on hand...? I dunno, I had red chips in the mail and some on hand, but couldn't collect them. It's been a while since I played, so I don't remember everything, but I think I had to get premium to hold more or something like that.  It's not all that bad, though. It's good for an apocolypse game that comes with good ideas for character builds and such. I like that you can craft pretty much everything you need, but some materials are extremely hard to get, and as I said beore, the crafting times are crazy. FE is basically an apocolyptic World of Warcraft. Obviously not as big, popular, or 'fixed'.  7/10 in my opinion to say the least.
7915	1	a	I loved this game, it's just so addicting! The only problem I have withit is the ocasional lag. But besides that it's fun!
5330	0	a	They game wouldn't even load for me. Before you say its my internet or my PC its not every other game I own works (except for L4d2), but when I did play it on a friends PC it sucked
5331	0	a	I played this game with my buddy Left Shark. He said he didn't really like it because Katy Perry wasn't in it. Honestly, I thought everything was trying to be put together into an RPG game, whilst you see that all there is to it is hilarious death sounds and funny PvP battles with enemies that die after yelling 'DIE!' I really think this game has potential, but I probably won't play it for a while.
5332	0	a	Not worth your time just an endless grindfest with lacking animations, combat and mondane quest sytem. 1/10
7917	1	a	I really saw potential in the gameplay. The first mission before you go open world was very interesting but the screen is just so messy in terms of menus and stuff. It annoyed me. But if you can look past that then you might find it pretty good
5343	0	a	Didnt know when the fun started.
5344	0	a	How do I even start this game?
7919	1	a	The things i liked : 1. crafting 2. survival 3. Massive Multiplayer 4.you can create almost anything ;)  The things i didn't liked :  1. you can have a little money problem in game ... but don't worry you will get some soon :D .    DOWNLOAD NOW!!!! :D and add me if you downloaded this i can help you ;)
7921	1	a	well to be honest I didnt expect much from this game but the quality isnt so bad its just needs major improvments to the Ai and I think it could be a great game to play.
7923	1	a	best game evea but kinda like a double of fallout  
5348	0	a	WORST F2P ON STEAM, LOOKS LIKE A PAY-TO-WIN WITH GRAPHICS THAT MY NETBOOK COULD HANDLE.
7925	1	a	play this game not because it's fun but because I say so.
5349	0	a	Its bad, confusing in start, playbase is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5350	0	a	tryed to load the game, dident work, deleted it, recently desided to give it another try, but only the review option was avalible.
7927	1	a	Hello, I am your average Fallen Earth player, with your average Fallen Earth player hours.
7929	1	a	The things i liked : 1. crafting 2. survival 3. Massive Multiplayer 4.you can create almost anything ;)  The things i didn't liked :  1. you can have a little money problem in game ... but don't worry you will get some soon :D .    DOWNLOAD NOW!!!! :D and add me if you downloaded this i can help you ;)
5356	0	a	This game gave me cancer
5357	0	a	I cannot comment on the actual game play because the game doesn't work. It keeps getting stuck on downloading updates and its stuck on a loop. After it downloads the updates, it restarts again and again.
5358	0	a	The graphics are terrible. Now, this wouldnt be so bad if its 2014 and the gameplay trailer had amazing graphics. At least with WoW they made the game a long time ago so its an excuse to not have good graphics, but this? But what is worse is the launcher. It took me 3 DAYS to download this dissapointment. To put that in perspective. I downloaded GTA 5, which is 16 gbs in 1 day. Fix your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The gameplay is clunky and the instructions are unclear. The first person mode is glitchy as all hell, and I could barely walk to the other towns without some high level destroying me. The story looks like it was pulled out of a toddlers imagination and turned into a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ vampire love story for teens. Also, the map is big. And I'm not saying this is bad, its just that the map is WAY TOO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING BIG. It breaks the gameplay and is so boring when I have to walk for 45 minutes just to complete a mission. I may have not played a lot, but I played enough.  Overall, this game is a big, dissapointing pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 3d models and bad voice acting, peppered with bad camera angles and broken game mechanics. 2/10.
5359	0	a	Isnt as good as it looks.
5360	0	a	Don't download unless you are willing to wait hours upon hours dowloaing it. Then waiting more hours downloading an update when you want to play.
7931	1	a	its great guys
7933	1	a	Quite frankly, this game makes me want to sever an artery in my wrist, smear my body in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and feed myself to pigs. So deperessing and boring.
7935	1	a	The people who complain about the download times for this game must have pure dung beetle internet. It took less than 10 minutes for the whole game to download and in 10 minutes it's at 6% for updates...  10/10 would 10/10 will 10/10 did 10/10 waiting 10/10 dusty keyboard   Edit: 1hr and 10 minutes and it's at 49%. (In the last 3 minutes) Just jumped up to 74%. Now 100%.
5364	0	a	this game has machanics for boath first and third person playstyle's and implements them and manny other game machanics horrobly. plus you'll be lucky if the game works more than once on you computer before it bugs out never to run again
7937	1	a	Fallout for poor people 11/10
7939	1	a	Free and great ,what do u want more ? :D
7941	1	a	Tedious
5370	0	a	When I saw this game, I expected to be somewhat of a DayZ experience to the extent that other players would be trying to kill you. I was very wrong in this assumption.   It turns out that the only enemies are the npcs. Speaking of npcs, they aren't even ok. All they do is walk around in a ten inch radius and will only attack you if you shoot at them or get really really close. Even if you're like three feet in front of their face, they will not attack you.    The weapon switch is also very finnicky. It took me five minutes just to get my character to dual wield. (that was either the game or just my lack of a good mouse   If you are looking for a game that has just an ok gameplay, I would bring this one up. But if you want a good survival game with good fighting and gameplay, do NOT get this one.
7943	1	a	Its a game! 10/10
7945	1	a	Great game. + Great skill system, gameplay. And battle actions. + Graphics are fine. Suit better for older computers.   - Not so many players online.  ++ If you want to try a good mmorpg. This is 1
7947	1	a	its a nice game keep up the good work :)
5375	0	a	ugh...
7949	1	a	After wandering the wasteland of Fallen Earth for more than 200 hours, thought it was time to give my opinon. There is a staggering amount of quests, mutant creatures, and crafting. Being this is such an awsome free mmo, I would rate this a 9/10. This game has been around for years now, and still has alot of people coming back for more. The graphic are smooth and realistic. A variety of sound, grapic, and other setting options. The help chat is one of the best I have ever seen! Hard not to get a help queston answered by more than one player. The ability to ride horses, atv's, and sweet cars across a very large map makes me want to get 3D headset. If there were air and water craft, I would probably never want to stop gaming!?.
5376	0	a	Very idiot Logic,some enemy can hit you with 10 m with an axe,or when you pass them with a motorbike,ythey will hit you with a small knife from 50m...very buggy,and the premium boxes worth nothing
5377	0	a	Fallen Earth is an excelent thought, but it has crapy controlles and graphics. They also did not put a lot of time on fixing glitches in the graphics.I would not recommend this to anyone that wants to have fun.
7951	1	a	I like he ''Mad Max'' feeling of this game, it's a great idea overall. But it would've been great if the developers tried to interact with their fellow fans.

5380	0	a	servers down everyday 2-5 hour maintenance everyday still the same bugs and glitches since 2009 the falling damage is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid, i jumped off a roof and landed on another building beside which was only 1 or 2 foot smaller and it took most of my health away been the same since 2009 dunno why they cut half of the starting areas most of them were good restrict everything down to the stupid queue time were you have to spend money to permamently raise it aswell as character slots(how stingy)

5381	0	a	At least the uninstall button works well
5382	0	a	spanning multi accounts, starting a civil war long ago against a clan in my own faction. death to RFDC lived on and the endless fun and hours of destruction will always have a place in my heart. but the devs have now become hackers and have abused their ways, the game is dying. faction wars and game polulation is down. i am sad to say it but fallen earth has fallen. and will not recover.
7955	1	a	Fallen Earth its my best MMO RPG-ACTION-ADVANTURE-PVP-PVE-RAID-CLAM-FIGHT-SURVIVAL-OPEN WORLD-CRAFTING-ZOMBIE-CO-OP-FPS/TPS and of curse ![Post-Apocalyptic]!  so im really RECOMMEND this game for all who love MMoRPGs Games  and thnx  leave like yo!
5383	0	a	requires that you make a gamersfirst account, never requires that you do NOT make a username and then requires it when logging in to the game
5384	0	a	No, I dont recommend this game.
7957	1	a	I don't think this is for me, probably good, I'll try it some more when I feel like I have no life...
5386	0	a	liek skyrim but with guns
5387	0	a	now this game is not good than before :^(
7959	1	a	Just gotta love the crafting system they have implemented in this game. Totally love it!
5389	0	a	I can't sign in. It just doesn't work. Don't know if this just is my fault or something wrong with the game. Looks like a good game but I can't make a certain justification on any gameplay as I have not yet experienced it.
5390	0	a	this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  iv only payed like 0,5 hours but it sucks more than â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing blockade. i do not know how you can play this game, i saw a guy in the reviews that had played for 3900 hours... WHAT THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it must be the creator of the game.
7961	1	a	The game is still alive, though it requires more players and better economy. If it were developed in early 2000's, it would have become the best game of a century
7963	1	a	If you do not receive an e-mail within 5-10 minutes, please try registering your account again.  ... F*cking registering 50 times again and again.  10/10 would lose 1 hour again.  I recomend this game :/ 
5396	0	a	WHOOO, EVERY FUN THING IN A GAME: Slow annoying movement, Crappy Ai's, Glitches, Crappy jump, Crappy mission system(its glitchy), Press Y to interact? Most games is press E, Crappy dailog box(it glitches...), Crappy skills.  Well, if ou like that crap ^^^ then this game, still isnt for you... its really that bad, don't play this game.
7965	1	a	Dead game(  http://steamcharts.com/app/113420#48h  
7967	1	a	very much like Fallout and STALKER. This game is very interesting with its PvP and mechanics which i enjoy very much and the transportations like horse's, and vehicles are a good feature. The community of Fallen Earth is the best part, everyone doesnt try to kill you they're pretty much friendly unless you kill someone then theyre gunna all go in a all out war with you. If you play PvP and kill someone with a different faction there WILL be consequences like for example, getting more noticed which is a problem since that will lead to death for you. I reccomend this game if you love Fallout and/or STALKER.
7969	1	a	.....
7971	1	a	When it was pay to play i made free accounts (a lot of them), and i enjoyed it but in the end i did pay for the subscriptions. played it like crazy for the first 4-5 months but then got borde of it. but i do go back to it every now and then for a bit. good character builds to mess around with, nice landscaping and graphics but the character animations are not 100%
7973	1	a	cool as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

7977	1	a	Fun game to play for about an hour from time to time, but playing it dedicatedly just makes it boring. Bad graphics, but can be looked past. The crafting system is extremely developed and expansive. However, the game is dying at a rapid rate, and losing players, which is a shame considering how fun it used to be around one year ago when I first played it.
5408	0	a	When i first played this back in 2012, i was using an 'All-in-one' touchscreen computer, and to say the least, the graphics were not that good (on my end), but here's my actual opinion  Pro's: - The combat alright to say the least when it comes to a cycle between a fps/rpg battle system, but it has it's merits for it's time. - with the current level of graphics i COULD muster, the game's visual was ok. - The npc/monster/enemy AI was mediocre at best, but that's common in most fps/rpg games.  Now for the Con's: - The explorability was ok, but unguided in it's purpose. - The story line was (IMO) uninteresting, and lacked that edge that captured the player's attention. - The enemies felt re-hashed in different areas of the game, and it was repetitous.  Decision?  Try the game, and see for yourself. if you feel it might be a predecessor to Borderlands; then you might be right. but i wouldn't reccommend buying the dlc for obvious reasons. I tried it out of a whim, and got bored of it shortly after playing a few hours.
7979	1	a	Multiplayer Fallout!
7981	1	a	this has the makings of a good game, too bad the online community on it sucks :/

5447	0	a	This game is full of minor but very irritating bugs (especially the UI), none of which have been fixed since I tried it three years ago. I strongly suspect that the owners (who, I believe, are not the original developers) are in 'Maintenance Mode', milking the game until players tire of it, but not adding any improvements or fixing any but the most serious of issues. Just on this basis alone, it is hard to justify sinking any money into it, which means you will be stuck with the sub-standard F2P experience.  Even if the bugs were fixed, though, the game utterly fails at narration: none of the characters are memorable. The missions, though ostensibly varied by their flavor text, ultimately feel very samey. How many times was I told to 'defend your location'? In one of the last missions I did, I had to go deep, deep into a prison to kill a boss. It was hard to find him, and at one point I had to traverse a corridor almost literally packed with enemies, who stood there blankly while I murdered their comrades 4 meters in front of them. I finally got to the boss, the culmination of all the mission stories in the zone. There was no dialogue or confrontation; he just attacked me, and what ensured was a long, long fight (due to his massive amount of health) where I tried to cut him to pieces with my knives, while he shot me in the face with a pistol. It's too bad, because his story was kind of interesting. (He was cloning himself, and apparently one of his clones decided to lead the resistance against him.)  Combat is tedious, and (for my melee build) mostly consisted of holding down both mouse buttons while aiming the reticule at an enemy. This is made difficult mostly by the camera, enemies' poor pathfinding -- which frequently causes them to run around unnaturally before they home in on you -- and the facts that the game occasionally ignores your keystrokes and gives little or late feedback when it does detect your keystrokes.  There are good things about this game -- otherwise I wouldn't have spent as much time with it as I did -- but I'm not motivated to list them here, because mostly what I feel about it now is frustration.

7993	1	a	It lives up to the definition of mmofpsrpg. The presentation's a little rough, and the game elements are thrown in your face kind of suddenly at the start, but it all works. Graphics seem a little dated but not terrible. Shooting is good, custmization is good. Plenty of story to discover as well.
5456	0	a	Another game that isn't made for Steam and should NOT be on Steam. Comes with it's own launcher with the most excrement like interface.  Requires account to be made.  Had only to jump through 100 hoops before I could play: Open with Steam -&gt; launcher -&gt; create account -&gt; opens website -&gt; create account -&gt; launcher login -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; luncher checks local content just downloaded with steam -&gt; launcher downloads updates (although I just downloaded it from Steam) -&gt; open with steam -&gt; login with launcher -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; check for updates -&gt; play  Horrendous movement, poor graphics, very very very unintuitive.   Couldn't make it past the first quest, so bad...
7995	1	a	I've played Fallen Earth from 2012, and here's my Review and heres why most people don't know what there talking about when it comes to negative Reviews.  This game Defines Apocolyptic MMO RPGs as one of the greatest yet.  Here's why Players put all this foolish Negative Feed Back and Here's why:  Most new Players find it very difficult to play this game because it's not easy to play, It's challenging, most players want a simple and Easy MMO And if that's the case then this MMO RPG is NOT for you.  Alot of Players find it hard to gain chips, if your serouis about this game and actually take the time to explore the massive gameworld and see what's worth what, gaining chips is relativly easy easy for new players.  The crafting system is one of the best I've seen in an MMORPG making it time consuming to figure out where to find certain matierals or if you have the chips just buy them off the auction if you have the chips to, and if there's any on the Auction. (Most players think this is stupid and QQ about it, This MMO RPG is not for you then.)  PvP is Unfair? Doubtful, you just need to know how to create a proper PvP build not just slap your AP points in whatever you think is best, they do make Fallen Earth Character Planners which you can access online by just punching it into google search. The thing with PvP is most players now are experinced Veterens playing, making it more challenging for newer players that hit higher levels to PvP, which is where Clans come into Play. Once you find a clan It's not so hard learning the ropes of PvP, however it is still a steep learning Curve.  Everythings to Expensive. Well heres the thing about that. It's the Apocalypse, Nothings going to be cheap especially not Vehicles, your lucky to even aquire one, most players think this is stupid However it's not. It's challenging just the way a game like this was Met to be.  Staff are useless GM's are bad? Doubtful, out of the few thousand players that play Fallen Earth theres only a Few GM's online so you need to stop and think you have other players PMing them at once to, they can't drop everything just to Help you. Your no Special then everyone else, The GMs/Staff are very Helpful once they actually get around to Responding to you, If you think there's only 2 or sometimes 3 GM's on at a time. A few Thousand Players.. Don't have high hopes of getting a responce. Your better off Submiting a Support Ticket @  Gamersfirst.com  rather then comming here and QQing about it because you think your special.  Now my Plus's about the game:  The game engine may be old but no one has yet to make a better MMO RPG, most game reviewers look at a game by graphics and gameplay, If it has bad graphics it automically get's a bad Review just because. That's now a game Reviewer at all but more of a Person that has to diss a game because it's not to there likings and specifications, It's probably better then what you could ever create to, so my question. What gives you the right to judge a game by graphics when you probably don't know a thing about game creating and how much effort and time and hours go into it? You don't. Peroid.  The game is hardly buggy at all. Theres the occasional the ground is invisible but that's a 3% chance of happening to you and even so it's an easy fix, Disable Post FX/Adv Post FX and it's fixxed, re enable it next game launch and it's fixxed.  Again it's an old game engine and it's very good considering how much detaiil is in each area, even players with Windows XP can play it without an issue.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes challenging and fun MMO RPGs. Then this game is for YOU.  Overall this is a one of a kind game and everything about it is truly Unique.  9/10 
5461	0	a	i can't even login to the game...
5462	0	a	Game was poop when I actually bought it in 2011. Very confuseing, no help from anyone, bugged quests, unclear ability uses and stat description....... an all around fail. The only cool thing about it was the vehicles and haveing to buy gas and what not, because the version I got gave me a quad.
5463	0	a	Its free, no game should EVER need to update in game. if your going to download it over steam NEVER EVER EVERRRRRRRR MAKE YOU SIGN UP ON A ALTERNATE WEBSITE AND HAVE TO UPDATE IN GAME. other than that i have not even played the game because of that!
5464	0	a	Another game that isn't made for Steam and should NOT be on Steam. Comes with it's own launcher with the most excrement like interface.  Requires account to be made.  Had only to jump through 100 hoops before I could play: Open with Steam -&gt; launcher -&gt; create account -&gt; opens website -&gt; create account -&gt; launcher login -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; luncher checks local content just downloaded with steam -&gt; launcher downloads updates (although I just downloaded it from Steam) -&gt; open with steam -&gt; login with launcher -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; check for updates -&gt; play  Horrendous movement, poor graphics, very very very unintuitive.   Couldn't make it past the first quest, so bad...
5465	0	a	this game is really bad. trust me.
5466	0	a	After waiting 26 minutes for the game to load and to create a character I got into the game, it immediatly crashed. So I reloaded. and it Immediatly crashed. So I reloaded again. And it immediatly crashed.  What I piece of garbage! No wonder its free. It doesnt work.
5467	0	a	After keeping me busy for over 700 hours and becoming a part of my daily routine, I started becoming leader (quite often) of the Citidel town defence. Went great until I found that I was wasting my time getting nowhere and I don`t want to pay to win in PvP and decided that life was too short.  Figured out that someone willing to pay could have done it all in about 20 hours or someone willing to pay for hacks.   10/10 pay to win or grind simulator
5468	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest game ever, dont get this stupid game, u cant do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...
5469	0	a	The game is completely unplayable on a brand new laptop. It freezes, crashes,and if it does run, it does nothing but give the equivlent of what WoW would be on dial up, if that.

7997	1	a	An interesting post-apocalyptic game. Usually when I think of post-apocalpytic games I think of a generic zombie shooter, so when I went into Fallen Earth, I was surprised (Granted there is a part of the main story where they kind of have zombies). Fallen Earth is a open world MMORPGFPS. It's alittle more hardpressed towards the survival aspect then the shooting aspect. Crafting is a big thing in Fallen Earth and is probably one of the funnest thing to do. Almost everything you can get, can be crafted. From weapons, armor, and even your ammo. Sure you can buy most of your items from the auction house, but there's a certain feeling of just crafting it yourself that is so amazing in the atomsphere that Fallen Earth has created. The combat is a twist between a FPS and a TPS. You can shoot in a third person camera view but I perfer playing in a first person view, Although it feels just a tad bit off and could use some work it's generally pretty good. Although not the most innovating or new, that's not really what Fallen Earth is about. In my opinion Fallen Earth is about the grander feeling of the atompshere of a Post-Apocalyptic world. Not saying anything about it being a hardcore role playing game but if you can get past the generic combat, it is quite an intriguing game. Theres plenty to do, and even from a story perspective, with all of the side quests and even the main quest is kind of interesting, it caters to a wide audience. If you're looking for an openworld MMO that focuses on elements other than combat, than look no further.
5471	0	a	Deleted this game, after endless re installs, couldn't get the game to load past the character generation screen,
5472	0	a	This game does not deserve to be on Steam.

7999	1	a	Just impossible to play because of lags most unoptimized game i have ever seen..
5473	0	a	welcome 2 update simulator. so first lets update. 2 hours later (in-game time doesn't work propperly) let's start. i was very excited and then it happend. error..... so let's try again. error again. so don't waste your time.
5474	0	a	some of the sounds worked, so I could hear people speaking, but not when they shot at me. also couldn't hear my own shots.  feels very clunky and slow.  uninstalled it.
8001	1	a	Apparently I played this for .3 hours some time in the past. I do not remember this. So either something's wrong with Steam, or this game has nothing worth remembering.  I don't even remember how I got to the store page to see that I was able to write this 'review'. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY?  Recommended because possible timewarp/10.
5477	0	a	Pros: The idea seemed cool. Poorly executed though.  Cons:  Clunky Controls, C**p gameplay, Pay 2 Win, 12 year old staff members with the ability to Powerflex when they choose to, and the list goes on.  Took me a few hours to download it, took me 5 minutes for Eric Cartman the moderator to find me and start talking smack and ban me because I refused to respect his authority despite him just being a massive do**he nozzle towards new players. Wasted so much bandwidth trying to play this s**t game. Would not recommend even p**sing in this games direction.
8003	1	a	Good game, definetly worth the price of nothing.
5478	0	a	Wont get load beyond the launch screen
5479	0	a	Don't.
5480	0	a	Honestly this game took such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥load of time to download, I couldn't stand to even play it anymore.  Just playing the intro, there's a lot of controls to memorize and figure out just too switch weapons and equip something.  I wouldn't take this review too personally since I didn't play it as much, but just a warning getting the game.
5481	0	a	This game is beyond broken
8005	1	a	ITS OK 50/50 depends on what your looking for
8007	1	a	i can say the game is overall fun, it has a unique story that somehow after many years makes me pick up the controls again and continue where i left off. it works for all it's subtle game play and it is a fun time all around in my opinion. you have to work for what you want. sometimes it is very time consuming, but once you get your prize it is worth it
5487	0	a	clunky, horrible anmations, gameplay is slow, drawn out, and hitboxes are broken with little to no appropriate sound effects.
8009	1	a	I actually purchased this game a long time ago, and played it then, got distracted by some other really good games. But this one is online, and has the perks you get with an online game. Thru Steam it is Free To Play, and I can't seem to get the game to start. Did a file validation, there were 11 files missing. I already have an account with Fallen Earth, so I should be good to go, as soon as I get those 11 missing files. What could have happened? Looking forward to getting started again and I'll update my findings. Yay Steam.
5492	0	a	this game kinda just showed up in my libraray
5493	0	a	Well, i played this game about 1 year ago + and it was nice game i enjoyed it it was original something new for me like a apocalyptic games fan and MMORPG i was excited but now.... its trash all i can say.
8011	1	a	Thumnbs up for this game,It is very diffrent from the other games I have played before but is loads of fun!!!!
8013	1	a	Interesting game
8015	1	a	Had it, kinda was confused on what to do ._.. Sort of like fallout but for free??
8017	1	a	Basicly Fallout online but not because of copyrights ;P
8019	1	a	I like this game a lot! I have played the Fallout series and it is simliar to this. Graphics are nice and there are tons of recipes. There is a lot of reading involved and you have to follow what the charecters diretions well.
5494	0	a	i couldnt even play the damn game. i made my character simple enough but the moment i stepped into the starting area the game froze. so i waited until it unfroze and it did. once it unfroze i looked around with the camera and no issues. then i tried moving and froze again. repeted multiple times. apperently this is common and reproducable. the tells me that whom ever made this game either doesnt care about it or are dropping the game altogether. but all in all until this huge issue with the game is resolved you won't see me anywhere near it.

8023	1	a	Good game, definetly worth the price of nothing.
8025	1	a	It's Good I guess. O.O
5506	0	a	I can't login to the game! Tell me how to login it... :( 
8027	1	a	amazing game.... always something to do... if you like fallout you WILL like this game.. its like fallout 3 but turned into an MMO and a better crafting system
8029	1	a	the game that got me into rpgs. thank you
8031	1	a	I enjoyed this game, up until the 'how I horse' questions bore through my skull like a diamond bullet. I never really joined a clan, but I did team up with people now and then. Can't say as a single player that I have had too many people try to kill my characters (factions). Haven't played in awhile, but my recollections was that the mods were very helpful, the forums full of information, and the pace was easy and slow (for some parts). Grinding is what you have to do and I got tired of it.
5508	0	a	this is the worst post-apocalyptic rpg i have ever played. play fallout instead of this.
8033	1	a	I Didnt figure out the system to play, but i think its decent for a f2p!
5510	0	a	Great game but unless you pay to play your character runs into xp level issues getting new quests in the 3rd region.  Also the melee based character is completely disadvantaged in many areas as the threat range for other NPC is within melee range, and they all have guns. So mnay quests can not be done ntil much higher levels (reduce threat ranges), thus less rewards (which are already reduced due to not playing to play).  The lack of players means it is hard to find teams to do some quests.
8035	1	a	Still waiting for game to start i have been waiting a while...
5519	0	a	Hard to follow missions with rude players who are really into it just to troll the ***k out of you continuously until you either quit playing or get good enough to beat them to death in return.
8037	1	a	I say this game is like a mixture between Fallout and Star Wars the Old republic. It looks great, definitely download it. Watch some gameplay vids 1st, it is a bit complicated if you are just starting it.
5526	0	a	It's exactly as if they took all the bad parts and mechanics of fallout and packed it into a game.
5527	0	a	Terrible controls are clunkey and are some what delayed pros:  1. not hard to run 2.decent story  cons:  EVERYTHING ELSE  dont waste your time on this game
8039	1	a	Its k
5530	0	a	No its just bad i had bugs, alot of em. also its content is just Crap! Worth your time? Nope

5535	0	a	The uninstall button works pretty well 10/10
5536	0	a	This game... This game is one of those game that you enjoy uninstalling more then playing the actual game and that is because of various reasons: 1. The game is no longer supported. 2. The game is very buggy and glitchy. 3. Only fun when getting really far through it. 4. Crashing non stop. 5. Srsly why am i keeping reviewing it like few years after it got out, we all know it sucks.
8043	1	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trash 0/10
8045	1	a	Love the game reminds me of a old fallout game classic!
5542	0	a	Hey lets put a help chat where the MOD's totally block everything you say bad about the game....played it for 45 min and they didn't allow anyone to say anything bad about the game.....let's just put it out there. It's not arcade like, mods black your chat espcially if you say something that insn't working. Stay away from the game if you can they don't want to hear the truth...The truth is this: they made a game that doesn't allow you to tell them whats wrong with it, the controls are not working, middle mouse button to switch from clicking to moving doesn't work....stay away from this game....
5543	0	a	I had several problems with this game the first being the graphics. The graphics were so bad that I had to use a graphics card and turn the settings all the way up just to be able to see anything other than my charcter. The second problem I had was with the controls they are a little odd because you have to change between 1st and 3rd person constantly. 3rd person for movement and everything else, and 1st person for using your weapon. The final problem I had was driving the vehicles, the first time I drove I barely bumbed a wall in what I think was an atv exploded and killed me.   I wouldnt recommend this game but it is free so why not.
8047	1	a	Please make Russian language 
5544	0	a	JUST BUY FALLOUT 4 OR 3 DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS 11/10
5545	0	a	this game absoloutly sucks
5546	0	a	This game is actually awful i'm glad i didn't have to pay for it.
5547	0	a	Every time I tried to leave the tutorial level, the game would crash.
5548	0	a	stupid as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in been downloading update for 2 hours â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥

5550	0	a	The games web site Fails to allow the player to make the account in the first place rendering the game pointless
5551	0	a	this game was fun be for the dev made it hard too play picking and take of caer of faction they like it get old after a long of time playing then the dev allow bullying harassment peoepl you did notuhing too get mad then start following you where every you go and kill you so yea i wont ever play this sorry game ever agning be thing the dev need too do is trun off the who's in the local area beacues pvp mean player vs player then mean there sholud not be any thing too give off where they are on the map or what part there in
8049	1	a	This game has come a long way since its first inception, and even more since going F2P. Totally worth it if you enjoy traveling the wasteland.
8051	1	a	pretty fun game when playing with friends. but there are lots of difficult and complicated if you dont play it enough... plus its really hard to get vehicles so if your new your stuck in one place........
8053	1	a	Pretty Good.
8055	1	a	I can't pinpoint why I enjoy this game so much, but enjoy it I do! The graphics are sub-par, causing me to hesitate through the tutorial as the controls were somewhat unintuitive and clunky at first. Keybindings can be changed, however I did manage to get used to the original controls within the first week or so.  The gameplay is a little repetitive, but I find most MMOs are. Gathering and crafting are both a large part of this game due to its survivalist nature, but combat is also significant in moving through the main story. Leveling is slow, but that's not necessarily a bad thing as there is substantial content in each area for you to level from.  Overall, the story line and community are both great, so if you can get past the controls and graphics on first glance, I feel like any MMO fan would enjoy this game.
8057	1	a	great game love everything about it...its different and IMO better than your classic style MMO which is well all there is right now. It doesnt hold your hand as much as blockbuster MMO's do. but it does help you along just enough that you wont flounder for to long unaware of what to do next. It has real genuine challenges, no bogus strings or restrictions you wouldnt expect. basically anything you want to do you can do it. it has hardcore elements that are in the player universe but are kept far enough away for the msot part that if you dont want to be a part of it you dont have to be.  only downside I can see is it needs a major overhual fairly soon. graphics and animations need to be redone and brought into 2015. if they did that this game would skyrocket to success no doubt about it
8059	1	a	great story awesome gameplay
8061	1	a	Good game in my Oponion, And if your looking for a decent MMO then I would get this one.
8063	1	a	did noot even work 4 me :'( i hat dis gam   lick if u cryi evry tim
5555	0	a	It wouldn't let me play soooo good luck?
5556	0	a	I was dropped into the game with no understanding of it, i was given no useful inforation from the game, i wondered around clicking everything i could and nothing happened. The most fun i had was uninstalling
5557	0	a	Just don't play it. It is a waste of time.
5558	0	a	Complete and total junk can't even gat past the create a charachter menu. When clicking 'CONFIRM' it just sits there doing nothing even when spammed  I would not recommend this game 2.5/10 atleast it runs
5559	0	a	ITS HORRIBLE THE GRAPHICS DO NOT EXIST LIKE THE WORLD IS NOTHING BUT A WHITE BOTTOMLESS PIT ITS A WASTE OF GIGS!!!
8065	1	a	Amazing ! I just got 3500 RP code for totally FREE ! Come and download code too    &gt;&gt;  {LINK REMOVED}  http://RiotPoint.eu/  &lt;&lt;

5563	0	a	i cant even play the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game because when i signed up for the login stuff in the game launcher it didnt even et crreate a username WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5564	0	a	Go play a real game.
5565	0	a	The game is full of problems,and problems cant be solved by ignoring them.
5566	0	a	its...Ehh not realy worth it its just so...generic and it needs to load up for like 40 min every time you play it so just not worth it sorry.
5567	0	a	this game dosent allow you to log in  
5568	0	a	The game got boring pretty quickly, I'm not sure if I like the story line or not. But if you are the type of person who loves apocalyptic games, you should try this one out to see if you enjoy it, but there's a high chance you will be disappointed. IMO, this game is not for me.
5569	0	a	this game looks good but when i downloaded it,it failed to start.even after deleting appcache and restarting the computer or deleting and redownloading it it still does not download........totally a waste of time.pls steam if you can fix it pls pls pls do so
5570	0	a	full of crap.
5571	0	a	before crafting was abit limited , but now its rekt, if u dont mind buying subscriptions eatch month , then go buy it, but id rather buy new vga.
8067	1	a	One of the best free to play post-apoc mmo I have played. It has everything from crafting to killing and well everything else you love in a wasteland game...even zombies but thats a given.
5574	0	a	I couldnt even get into the game after I made my acount.
8069	1	a	Well if your into those shity games like minecraft well it's better to play this game you can get ATVs and cars and go on missions I think it's the best game I've ever played
5576	0	a	it glitches at the start for me please fix this 
5577	0	a	very glitchy
8071	1	a	how do you make a account? 
8073	1	a	Game has changed a lot, but the old versions used to be really fun and immersive. It's a lot more modernized(microtransactions, pay2win), but is still enjoyable as it has a spark of what it used to be
5580	0	a	Not a bad game but also not the best game. My only concern about this game is the controls are complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it makes the game almost unplayable. Another thing is that u have the press either 'Y' or the scroll wheel to toggle the ability to look around and thats kind of stupid. Like i said, not a bad game but also not a good game. If you want this game, by all means get it but i dont recommend it.
5581	0	a	I couldnt even get into the game after I made my acount.
8075	1	a	Its a fun little expience a that really captures the postapolticalic feeling despite it s graphics
5586	0	a	Wasted 30 minutes of my life playing this game. Bad sound effects bad controls bad graphics bad gameplay.
5587	0	a	You think from the screen shots its a cool mad max game, in reality, it was a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Don't bother weekly rated this game, 'a huge pile/slice of don't bother'
5588	0	a	poor graphix would acceptable with a free game if the controls didnt suck especially hard.
5589	0	a	This game have serious performace issues... I crash everytime I try to play, I cant move more than 5 steps and it crash.
5590	0	a	I played this for less than an hour, Then the moderators in the game were total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because I 'Wasn't asking questions or talking about the game in chat' instead I was saying things like 'Hey Guys, what's up!' and the moderators gave me a warning because it had nothing to do with the game... So making converation will get you banned..fun. 
5591	0	a	it was more like fallen earth pay2play. no. not pay2win. pay2play. ridiculouse. this is the third bad review i have ever given a game. seems like it woulda been good. but it isent 
5592	0	a	Uninstall works perfect.
5593	0	a	.6/10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
5594	0	a	When I made an account it never asked me to make a username. When I go to sign in it asks me for the username i never created??? What is my mythical username and how do I find out?
5595	0	a	Horrible, HORRRRRRRRRRIIIIIBBBBLLLLE.. I unistalled this garbage before the tutorial or whatever you want to call it was. Sounds are missing, enimies run around at mach 12, buggy trash. Do not waste presious time off your life to even attempt to play this.
8077	1	a	If you like to play fallout this is the game like fallout but as in a MMO.
8079	1	a	It's okay for a game that came out way back in 2009 before being on steam; it's one of those long and slow progressing games ~ While you can level your toon pretty fast early on ~ you'll reach the slow grind and long crafting around lvl20. That's where I first gave up looking at the recipes taking 1-2days in real life with subscription boosts to craft.  It's more so a game you play when you had enough of Fallout 3 and moved on to Fallout New Vegas ~ then had enough of Fallout New Vegas for the moment [mods and the DLC will keep you busy for hours] ~ then you move on to Fallen Earth giving that a couple of hours ~Then back to Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 4 [steam sale going at the time of this post]  Note: No new content ~ Generally quiet ~ but the servers are still up so you can always pop in and check if you finally crafted your component ~ then craft the next 2 day wait component I have clocked about 110+ hours over the last 2 weeks ~ maybe 3 of them was actual game play the rest was waiting in craft [Not kidding] or travelling to a new lifenet pod city to get more recipes~ I've increased my Cooking level both in game and in real life during this time
5598	0	a	rather play with my own faeces
8081	1	a	the naked caterpillar. what more do you want from a game?
5599	0	a	Very very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up
8083	1	a	Its great in many ways, for starters its something different, Ive played on and off since game came out and it has been refreshing at times.
8085	1	a	what an awful game this was
8087	1	a	scared other player by laying down   10/10
8089	1	a	Grinding and Farming and Grinding and Farming and Grinding and Farming and Grinding and Farming and Grinding and Farming and Grinding and Farming and Grinding and Farming and Grinding and Farming
8091	1	a	Its such a great game, but the whole fun is limited to buying a premium account
8093	1	a	this game is nice when textures are rightt 
8095	1	a	it is amazing never played it  
5613	0	a	IDFK what to say. Lets just say like all f2p games. I stop playing after a few days, but this game? Only lasted three hours before I said ' I am bored, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it time for Fallout 3.' Also don't even buy anything from this game, no. Just save that money and buy the entire Fallout series. You won't regret it. This is just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ online version of Fallout 1,2,3, and NV.
8097	1	a	I was almost addicted to this game! There is such a vast world! I love it!
8099	1	a	&gt;1st launch, gets in the game  &gt;Customize the character  &gt;Trying to move but I can't, noticed that the controls were distributed really weirdly  &gt;Got into the first bit of combat, couldn't kill the enemies because one of them were immortal for some reason  &gt;Died  &gt;Respawned, killed the first few enemies  &gt;Got out of the starting area  &gt;Looked over the hill on the left, tons of enemies were spawning  &gt;Went over killed a few  &gt;Others came too, murderfest started  &gt;Got killed  &gt;Respawned, got stuck  &gt;Finally got back onto the surface, got a random horse  &gt;Spawned the horse and went riding it  &gt;Found some interesting stuff and got off to check  &gt;Enemies started coming and I couldn't get back on the horse to escape(bugged)  &gt;Didn't have the gear to kill them  &gt;Got killed again  &gt;Started going on foot into a distant land, nothing appeared  &gt;Got killed again by some kind of buggy teleporting dogs in combat  &gt;Never played again  11/10 would do combat again  Seriously, this game would be really good if the devs would actually care about it I want to give a yes and a no recommendation at once, too bad I can't so I'll give a yes.
8101	1	a	Open world, sandbox. No linear story. Start from anywhere, anytime. No limited zone based on player level.  Limited outfits only for faction armors, weapons and accessories; 90% of the items in the game can be obtained and worn. Huge array of cosmetics items for your toons.  Crafting-based game with about 90% of the items in-game are craftable.  Huge world using real topography of the great Grand Canyon.   Been playing online games since 1999 and by far this is one of the best in the apocalypse category.  Best game ever!
8103	1	a	This game is pretty fun if you like crafting and taking your time in video games!
5620	0	a	While I love this game, I honestly can't recommend it. It's dead as hell and has had NO new content in like three years.
8105	1	a	it looks fun but tell me is it fun cause i dont know 
5622	0	a	It says that I played this game for 14 hours... this 14 hours of trying to get it to work, this incluedes making an acount and trying to verify it for ages and also I had to make several accounts attempting and waiting to see if it would work but in the end I gave up!
5623	0	a	JUST BUY FALLOUT 4 OR 3 DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS 11/10
5624	0	a	fallout meets mmo.  thats about it.  +1 Post-Apoc -1 clumsy control -3 time consuming crafting. and i do mean time consuming. its like EvE on ground. it takes x time to make y item +1 zones are freaking huge -1 other players.... think barrens chat -3 the bugs. oh lordie the bugs. nothing like taking a shot at something and magically what would be a killshot turns into a miss because it moved to the otherside of the screen  so 2/10  i tried to love it
5625	0	a	Logged in for the first time and spawned underground and i was stuck there.   0/10 can't even get as simple as this working.
5626	0	a	It sucks.
8107	1	a	Oh boy yes do I reccomend this game. The Combat system is a clever mix of Third/First Person Shooting/Melee like Skyrim or Fallout with some Tab Combat like WoW when casting Mutations (Basically spells for healing, damage and support) so you can choose to simply ignore one play style over the other or use a mix of one. If you want to dual wield two, one handed melee weapons or guns then go for it, the game allows you to even use a one handed melee and gun at the same time, basically filling melee and range in one go.  BE AWARE though that the mouse buttons are backwards, to use the weapon in your right hand click the left mouse button and vice versa. I haven't found a way to fix this without it affecting interactions with the world so my advice is don't change it.  The only flaws are the sound and beginners confusion. I personally found the ambience quite annoying and the game is very quiet out of combat but I suppose you could call it relaxing.  At the beggining of the game you follow a simple tutorial dungeon (with good voice acting) and then you get to pick one of three starter locations that tailor to how you would like to play.   You have a few starter quests which thankfully come one at a time but when you leave that slice of starter land and head into town then you'll find there are lots of quests that need doing. They don't appear very cleatly on the mini map so look hard and you'll notice little hazard symbols like the desktop icon bare visible on the mini map. Those are quest icons.  I did notice that the starter areas seem to follow a similar story at first, just in a different landscape.  One thing that really confused me was Tradeskills. I'm sure once I devote more time to the game and decide what kind of character I want to be I'll understand it better.  If you want a nice little MMO that puts the best features of WoW and Fallout into one then have a go...
5627	0	a	It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
5628	0	a	Wasted 30 minutes of my life playing this game. Bad sound effects bad controls bad graphics bad gameplay.
5629	0	a	For some reason i cant play it, it lags and crashes when i press the TAB key to attack. So yeah,not happy about that.
5630	0	a	This game completely sucks, I didnt like anything about it, and its missing sound....... Not recommend
8109	1	a	I see this time and time again. A new player joins and quits after about a few hours, not giving the game enough time to fully understand it. This game is very good what i like the most about it is the ability to build your character's stats almost any waay u want to. also the crafting is very in depth and almost like no other mmo. i recommend giving this game a try.
8111	1	a	Loads of content for a free-to-play MMO. Some of the game play can be a bit grinding, but the crafting is rich with variety.
5636	0	a	This game is Terrible even for a free to play game. you have waaaaaaaay to many screens open while you play so u can never see where the ememies are you also are forced to switch weapons using Ctrl plus the moouse wheel witch only works about 20% of the time and on top of all of that if an enemy is chasing you theres no escaping, the can literaly hit you with a shank for like 12 feet away and i have to be at makeout distince to even hit him with my pistol, all together this is probably the worst game ive ever played in my life
5637	0	a	i could never figure out how to log in or even make an account. i never got past the damn login screen.
5638	0	a	Hey lets put a help chat where the MOD's totally block everything you say bad about the game....played it for 45 min and they didn't allow anyone to say anything bad about the game.....let's just put it out there. It's not arcade like, mods black your chat espcially if you say something that insn't working. Stay away from the game if you can they don't want to hear the truth...The truth is this: they made a game that doesn't allow you to tell them whats wrong with it, the controls are not working, middle mouse button to switch from clicking to moving doesn't work....stay away from this game....
5639	0	a	I had several problems with this game the first being the graphics. The graphics were so bad that I had to use a graphics card and turn the settings all the way up just to be able to see anything other than my charcter. The second problem I had was with the controls they are a little odd because you have to change between 1st and 3rd person constantly. 3rd person for movement and everything else, and 1st person for using your weapon. The final problem I had was driving the vehicles, the first time I drove I barely bumbed a wall in what I think was an atv exploded and killed me.   I wouldnt recommend this game but it is free so why not.
8113	1	a	It's a really fun game and it's kind of like fallout because you can roam around and collect items 
5640	0	a	my PC is decent and manages to run alot of games but this one... nope it doesent even run smoothly on lowest graphics
8115	1	a	this game is cool
8117	1	a	this game is nice when textures are rightt 
8119	1	a	it is an exelent game and very addictive so if you like fallout this is recomended 
8121	1	a	If there was a fallout online, and it had a massive dump, this game would be that dump.   Good community, once you reach the areas they hang out in. When you start, the game will put you clean off and you may very well quit. It has massive maps, and the starting map is very empty, you'd be forgiven for thinking the game was about to shut down due to no players. I quit the first time i played, but if you keep at it, you'll locate the player community on the third section.   I got a good few hours in the game, I really enjoyed the clans and the big drama they all love to cause. You'll find the Devs are friendly and you get to know them after a while.  give the game a try, hell it's free so why not.
5642	0	a	Its pretty awful
5643	0	a	I've put alot of time and effort into this and it's very unfortunate that I can't read because if I DID i'd be able to read the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing questlines
8123	1	a	To anyone who enjoys a gritty post-apocalyptic world with a detailed crafting system, yet doesn't mind a slightly clunky, aging interface - I would suggest they at least give it a few hours.
5651	0	a	Literally Only Played Because I Was Out Of Money Awful Story 0/10
5652	0	a	Body Hair? What're you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gay?
5653	0	a	crashes on loading screen. i have the specs. game got the bugs.
5654	0	a	Weird movement mechanics
5655	0	a	This game crashed every time I ran it and still had bugs and when I got past the crash part it crashed aagin.... Horrible game.
8125	1	a	Cool but i do belive that nonmebers should get some form of a dune buggy at very low level just because its fair :3
5656	0	a	Its pretty awful
5657	0	a	I've put alot of time and effort into this and it's very unfortunate that I can't read because if I DID i'd be able to read the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing questlines
5658	0	a	Ok I'd really didn't play the game but it has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics and im pritty shore i had difficulties with the key binding WHAT i mean is its different to to games like this and at the start it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T i could not loot the bodys that NPC KILLS YES THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING NPC I dont know if this effects the game later on but thats it hop it helps.
8127	1	a	Took six hours to install the game. Took another two hours installing updates. All this to crash repeatedly on start up. 9/10 great progress bar simulator.
8129	1	a	Game has changed a lot, but the old versions used to be really fun and immersive. It's a lot more modernized(microtransactions, pay2win), but is still enjoyable as it has a spark of what it used to be
8131	1	a	It's a loading simulator, not a MMORPG of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  10/10 loading sim
8133	1	a	Amazing game one of my fav. games in the past Sadly it doesn't have much players..
5661	0	a	If this game had players, and an ACTUAL endgame BESIDES PVP... it would be pretty damn good.. but the flaws in the game are just so ridiculous it's beyond the scope of f2p to even tolerate. They STILL havent done anything significant with the game despite having years of live time.   Skip it, and just let it die gracefully.
5662	0	a	For some reason i cant play it, it lags and crashes when i press the TAB key to attack. So yeah,not happy about that.
5663	0	a	This game crashed every time I ran it and still had bugs and when I got past the crash part it crashed aagin.... Horrible game.
8135	1	a	this pretty boring game some stupid story too but luckely this is free game!
8137	1	a	There is is thing i didn't know about this game im glad i found this out, its called......TRASH!!! UNINSTALLED
5674	0	a	Godawful game, its a laggy mess with horrible graphics. Just Don't get it. Its a waste of time.
8139	1	a	This game took me a little bit to get used to, I am very glad I took the extra time and didnt just stop because now I really enjoy this game. I have put in a decent amount of hours into the game, and I have really become addicted to it. Great crafting set up, decent amount of story type missions for you to do, and actually a pretty friendly community. There are a few things that could really be worked on that I will mention but for the most part a great game.  I very much like the crafting, and sometimes find myself staying in the same shop crafting for hours. You could pretty much completely stay away from anything mission or town wise and be completely happy making yourself food to keep healed up, or use your wide range of healing abilities. You cant completely do that though, there are a few different items that you can not craft, that you would have to get lucky on a drop with or buy from a merchant. From what I have seen you dont get chips(credits) from loot drops though, it seems to come from missions or selling your drops.  The two things that I have noticed that needs improvement are the enemy AI, you can almost walk five feet away from them and have them not notice you at all. The other thing is some of the vagueness on missions. There is not a lot of detial with some of the missions, some of them you really do need to just figure out on your own or ask the help channel for any input.  All and all, I do very much like this game and see myself playing for awhile.  
5676	0	a	this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game is so boringg i willl rather cut my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off the graphics are bland your character is so slow and right from the start the game overwhelms you
5677	0	a	is it bad? i dont know
5678	0	a	its way to dark not even the britness hepled it #poo face 
5679	0	a	Couldn't get past the 'create account' and log in with steam crap. Waste of 6GB hard drive space.
5680	0	a	Worst game I've tried to download on steam by far.
5681	0	a	Ancient game. Horrible game company. Devs/GMs are actively the biggest jerks in the game.  So much better games out there.
5682	0	a	
5683	0	a	apparently this used to be enjoyable. but at this point its just pay to win.
8141	1	a	There is is thing i didn't know about this game im glad i found this out, its called......TRASH!!! UNINSTALLED
8143	1	a	I was almost addicted to this game! There is such a vast world! I love it!
8145	1	a	9/10  I actually love this game, although there are frustrating things about it...
5684	0	a	Just not my type of game. I dont like the way I have to switch between combat mode and having to switch back to do anything else with the mouse. Graphics could be better.
8147	1	a	a good game like fallout and borderlands
5685	0	a	This game is pretty much Trash. Get it if you're in the need to find motivation to do something better with your life, than this dev team did with theirs.
8149	1	a	After having a little experience on this I can say that this is possibly the greatest Free to Play i've ever came across, the world is relatively big and the whole gameplay is intense!
8151	1	a	This game took me a little bit to get used to, I am very glad I took the extra time and didnt just stop because now I really enjoy this game.

8153	1	a	its fun when u have a friend to play with
8155	1	a	Started to play because of the post-apocalypse feel. Stayed for the random flashmob dance :P
5690	0	a	its way to dark not even the britness hepled it #poo face 
5691	0	a	Downloaded off of steam, made account at whatever website it redirected me to, website only used my email and password. The game itself is asking for a username, but I've never been given an option to make a username, and when I go to make a new account it brings me to the same crap where it only uses my email. Can't figure this out, I'm probably just autistic. Still very dissatisfied that this whole sign in thing was very poorly designed, if I can get helped with this or get it fixed if this is a legit problem, I'll write another review when it actually lets me play the game.
5692	0	a	Honestly I Probably might like this game if it wasn't for  A)The 3rd Party EULA/Login  and B) the fact i couldn't login even though i had signed up  Hopefully this will be fixed.
5693	0	a	Well, gud game but... i know it's from 2011... but i reload my weapons whit my foot or something else ? WADAâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THESE ANIMATIONS
8157	1	a	Well wht can i say other than wow! ( no not world of warcraft ffs)   This game tests ur patience with some good old grinding, no not boring (NOTICE ''I SAID GOOD OLD GRINDING'') stop being negative already geez xD  So where was I... Oh yes! if u hav a brain and like sum crafting and sum action this game is soooooo what u need, if u have half a brain just pass coz this here is not for dumb people, ull hav loads of fun and the learning curve is easy and if ur really stuck u hav an online GM help line too :) which is helpful but dont go every 5secs n ask the same stupid SH*T coz ull get a full blast go play the game and figure it out a lil from a GM xD ( i totally agree with )  So u dont ask to be the best u learn to be the best thts final, the game is ruthless and nicely planned out, dnt go and expect to just get a vehicle lol u gta build 1 which is epic too coz hey the world is busted so scavenge get stuff and start with sum tyres and a frame etc etc ull hav the full reward of it in a good couple of hours :) so the crafting system is most awesome :)   Yes there is a few bugs etc but hey u ever played a bug free game that aint on console......? my point exactly  so give the game a whirl ull love it  8/10
8159	1	a	Fallen Earth is an extremely clever game! It's mechanics are well defined, and thankfully free to play. It follows a traditional MMO pattern, but with it's own defining characteristic. A FPS or thirdps mechanic that works fantastic! Any MMO fan will feel at home here. It's crafting system is amazing, but if you are the kind of person who loves crafting, you might end up spending a lot of game time gathering the materials you need to build in game objects. PVP is good. Unfortunately there was only one game type that was generously populated, the rest having either zero or a handfull of players wanting to play it.   Since it's free, there's nothing wrong with checking it out! Be wery, the game glitched on a ATI Radeon 4300.
8161	1	a	This game has to be one of the best i played in months since i was bored and this saved me from my boredom i really recommend this game to people who're bored
8163	1	a	God i love to shoot nuclear monsters with a paintball gun
8165	1	a	quick fun... I recommend it if you are looking for an ONLINE version of FALLOUT. I am surprised that BETHESDA hasn't come out with an all online game version of the storyline FO (Fallout Online)...lol...But this will fill in the void for now if that is what you are looking for.
5698	0	a	The game is pure awesome in a Fallout 3-like world (with a bit of green) with Multiplayer. There is also first-person view mode by using the Mouse Wheel (or pressing F9), so you can play it like an FPS game as well as the usual Third Person.  There is about 6 different *big* Regions to explore, Missions (some can be done co-operatively), Person Vs Monster with set PVP Zones shown on the maps, Factions, Crafting numerous items such as Snipers/Pistols/SMG's &amp; other stuff, Scavenging, Leveling up, Auctions, use Vehicles like Cars/ATVs/Motorbikes/Horses, Clans, Riots, and a whole lot more.  I've played this game for at least 4000 Hours by now (even donated at least $80), and I must say it's a very good Free To Play Game. If you donate at least $10 by buying something from the Marketplace, you get a LOT of extras for being a first-time purchaser.
8167	1	a	Like on other guy said. Clans need to be able to build their own base as they want. Its an post apocaliptic game. Having the ability to build a home in a ruinned place would be awesome other than that its a bit boring
8169	1	a	There is a lot wrong with it. Enemy AI is terrible. The faction system, what was once its greatest strength, has been neutered into non-existence. But if you like crafting, like the open post apocolypse world, like the idea of a genuine RPG FPS MMO without tab-targeting, this could be for you. And it is FTP, so you have nothing to loose in trying it!   (The only real limitation on FTP accounts being crafting is slower and you may only craft one thing at a time).
8171	1	a	gas masks are ace. auto favorite game. 10/10
8173	1	a	Fun for quite a while actually for a long time for me but it gets boreing after a bit (played solo most of the time)
5701	0	a	Just not my type of game. I dont like the way I have to switch between combat mode and having to switch back to do anything else with the mouse. Graphics could be better.
8175	1	a	Um this game is just plain weird
5704	0	a	it necer signs me in even if i use my steam
5705	0	a	Honestly I Probably might like this game if it wasn't for  A)The 3rd Party EULA/Login  and B) the fact i couldn't login even though i had signed up  Hopefully this will be fixed.
5706	0	a	Very difficult to get your bearings set from the beginning. There isn't much of an in-game tutorial to help you ease into it. Quests seemed standard 'kill X of Y in zone Z' or 'gather/craft X of Y'. The combat system is crazy weird to me, and I cant even begin to describe the crafting system... The fact that its Post-Apoc wasteland is about the only thing this game has in common with Fallout. I feel as though the game HAS potential, but that alone doesnt merit a good game. Implementation and execution on things seemed lacking. I uninstalled without a second thought.  I didn't play it for long, so I speak on a very limited experience, but I still wouldn't suggest this mess of a game on anyone.
5707	0	a	it glitches at the start for me please fix this 
5708	0	a	This game completely sucks, I didnt like anything about it, and its missing sound....... Not recommend
8177	1	a	if you like poop games this is 4 u
5710	0	a	Dumb game has bad graphics, actually didn't mind the ok combat and art style, the little story I read was not interesting enough to engage me, and I couldn't pass this one door in the tutorial because I for some odd reason able to destroy the only key to open the door so I couldn't even play past the first like hour.
5711	0	a	This game sucks. I can't even play it because my 'new' account won't work.
5712	0	a	Well, gud game but... i know it's from 2011... but i reload my weapons whit my foot or something else ? WADAâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THESE ANIMATIONS
8179	1	a	i think its perety col its awsome some peps should come try it out 
5716	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game don't try to play it its like combat ars â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ omg !
5717	0	a	game wouldn't load  -100/â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game
8181	1	a	p good around lvl 15 for some reason it turns into an enormous grind that lasts 200 years  
8183	1	a	how do you make a account? 
8185	1	a	Never played this game steam says i have so....  Roasted pumpkin soup recipe  â€¢ 1.5kg edible pumpkin â€¢ Olive oil â€¢ 1 teaspoon dried chilli â€¢ 1 tablespoon coriander seeds â€¢ 1 large onion â€¢ 3 cloves garlic â€¢ 1 carrot â€¢ 1 stick of celery â€¢ 1 litre hot vegetable stock  Preheat the oven to 170Â°C/340Â°F. Half the pumpkin and remove the seeds (you can keep these for roasting), then chop into wedges. Place the pumpkin on two large baking trays and drizzle over a little olive oil. In a pestle and mortar, grind the chilli and coriander seeds with a pinch of salt until finely ground. Sprinkle the spices over the pumpkin with some black pepper. Roast the pumpkin for 1 hour, or until soft and slightly caramalised at the edges.  Meanwhile, roughly chop the onion, garlic, carrot and celery. Heat a lug of olive oil over a medium heat in a large saucepan then add the vegetables and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and sweet but not coloured.  When the squash is ready, add to the pan with the hot stock. Blend with a stick blender, adding a little more water if you like a thinner consistency. 
8187	1	a	The Fallen Earth its like DayZ
5719	0	a	this game is sooooo bad. Physics are terrible, no sounds when walking, shooting, punching, i will never play this game again be the way this game's graphics are bad and in pictures are better but... I don't recommend to play this game.
8189	1	a	great survival game good crafting recipes this has a good storyline to it its awesome
8191	1	a	interesting game, but takes too long to launch and install it.
5720	0	a	It have got a lot of bags. And error in connecting 3/10 Screenshoots are good :3
8193	1	a	its god game but i hate when i kill someone he spawns after 20 seconds
5721	0	a	This game is just not enough it could be nice 7-8 years ago dont download waste of time
8195	1	a	Entertaining and challenging
5722	0	a	Go to de_Nuke and start apocalipse instead of this.
8197	1	a	I live my life by a moral code. I give games a chance to prove themselfs, but this game has broken my will to live. It looks like a child stuck in the 90s has mad this and is amazed by its visual aspects. The cancer in my eyes will forever burn. Thank you for this life lesson. I suggest everyone tries this game but have a friend presant so as to stop you from self harming.
5723	0	a	this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game is so boringg i willl rather cut my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off the graphics are bland your character is so slow and right from the start the game overwhelms you
8199	1	a	this game is bert 
5725	0	a	as much as i like this game it not the game i would play i could not even start the game i got to the char part and that was it no play
8201	1	a	Fun for quite a while actually for a long time for me but it gets boreing after a bit (played solo most of the time)
5727	0	a	What the hell!!! I went through all of the time making an account for this game, to be back at the login screen with it prompting me for a username and a password, when the acccount creation didn't allow me to enter in a username, anywhere. Dumbasses! How am I supposed to log in with something I don't have?
8203	1	a	Extremely like fallout, really long, few bugs but its fine.
8205	1	a	can make horse go on car, go 100mph. drift and propell me and my horse at the speed of fast.  10/10 would f*ck
8207	1	a	Got molested in a cave by Mutated Ants  10/10
8209	1	a	Crazy post apocalyptic MMO with even crazier crafting!
5728	0	a	This game is way to complicated to set up. - make a Gamersfirst account - give email and make a password - start game  When I started the game, it took me to a log in screen. It asked for a username (which it didn't have me make) so I thought, 'Maybe I just need to type my steam log in.' and I did that. It didn't work. I went onto the Gamersfirst website to see if they (for some reason) made the username for me. i would then change it to my liking. i get into the fallen Earth profile page and the username is a combo of numbers and letters and dashes. The number of tacks for the password was WAY off to the one I had created.   So unless you know what you are doing, save the headache and don't waste your time trying to download this.  (If I was only making it hard, tellme what I did wrong. Until then, I don't recommend this game)

5732	0	a	the cancer the cancer oh the cancer i think it gave me cancer
8213	1	a	great game
8215	1	a	I liked this game alot it definately can submerge you in quests and loot farming, searching for parts.
8217	1	a	IT WAS AWESOME ALMOST AS AWESOME AS THE 4 DAY DOWNLOAD!!!
8219	1	a	this game is an epic adventure/survival game that will eliminate all other free to play games on steam. most defanantly worth getting it. Especialy because its a free to play game.
5733	0	a	It's not a Good game.
8221	1	a	Reminds me of Mad Max: Beyond Thunder Dome
8223	1	a	Great MMO, wish there weren't better ones out there like NWN or SWTOR But, for end of the world apocolypse MMO, this is still the best that I've seen. 
8225	1	a	A truly ambitious recreation of the Fallout series in MMO format minus any talent whatsoever.
8227	1	a	Fallen Earth is pretty fun.. if you can get passed all the grinding. It's your typical MMORPG set in a post apocalyptic/fallout type of setting. This game is not pay to win, unless you want shortcuts in crafting or faster leveling.  Pros: - Crafting system - RPG style - Small and helpful community - Massive world - Variety of weapon types (Guns, Crossbows, Knives, Swords, Hammers, Etc.) - Variety of skills - Incorporates faction based quests and items - Holiday themed quests and items - Vehicles - Fast traveling - And so much more   Cons: - Combat system is a bit shabby - Leveling up is very slow - Hordes of monster everywhere you turn outside of the towns  Now i haven't played since October 2014, so i'll come back and update this review if neccassary.
5736	0	a	At first, I was like 'Ah hell, it's free, why not?' An hour later I'm bored â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
8229	1	a	i give it a fish out of blurg  fish/blurg
5740	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. Not worth it. bye
5741	0	a	I mean, if you want to spend $100+ on a game instead of something useful in life; then SURE go ahead and play this game. I mean, who doesn't like shoddy grsphics, a horrible community, and horrible controls...then yes if you want to pay $100+ just to SURVIVE for a little while in this game...go right ahead...
5742	0	a	It's kinda... 'Eh'
8231	1	a	it's a good game!!!

8237	1	a	IT WAS AWESOME ALMOST AS AWESOME AS THE 4 DAY DOWNLOAD!!!
8239	1	a	metacritic gave it above 5/100!?!?!?! i thought they only gave high scores to call of duty    :/
5749	0	a	DO NOT.... DOWNLOAD... THIS GAME!!!!!  It is quite a buggy, fustrating mess of a game that is trying to be fallout but with mmo but fails because while fallout was more an experience with a narrative, fallen earth is just quests with little unique background interaction, i ran around the world for 2 hours and the only out of quest experience i had was finding a glitch that made me go though a tree and end up on top of it. if it wasnt abit too big to play for the lols i would say, play it for the lols but dont even try.
8241	1	a	I would have this game's babies
5751	0	a	Was about 3 years ago I played it, but it was sheer poop so I don't recommend it. I mean come on just look at the screenshots, the game is astonishingly fugly and not to meantion the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ blocking atmosphere... Sheeshh....  Oh yeah it is free2play which means it is also pay2win.  I give it a -1337 out of 10
5752	0	a	this game is trash kys
8243	1	a	Never played it but Steam let me write a review.
5762	0	a	Can't even play the game, too many issues with updating; It keeps reinstalling the same update over and over again so actually launching the game from steam is impossible.
5763	0	a	If you like to RP then this game is for your for everything else go find a different game. The Devs have no idea how to develop a video game and most of them ended up quiting anyways there is like 3 developers left.
5764	0	a	I like what it was trying to be, but the UI and combat is just so klunky it fails sadly.

5766	0	a	I played this a while back and at first the game seemed pretty interesting, but then I tryed to get an ATV. (I understand this may not have been the best goal ever right at the start of the game.) Anyway, I didn't appreciate the abnoxiously large expanses of nothing. My friends and I were roaming along for a few hours, trying to get to the very distant places to finish the quests to get ATVs. The questline to get the ATVs was rediculously long and it also felt like you had to pay for stuff in order to get anything good. I don't know how it is now, but I don't particularly recommend this game due to the miles of annoyingly empty expanse that I had to traverse.  P.S. I'm sure this is a great game for those who enjoy MMORPs, please make sure to read other reviews. (I'm not a huge MMORPg player, therefore I did not get very far in the game. I also had a bad experience with my friends running off and stuff.)
5767	0	a	HEAVILY touched up 'Screenshots' mislead you. This game does not look half as pretty as they mislead you to believe.   It is a 6/10 average MMO
8245	1	a	It's like Fallout, but with multiplayer.

5771	0	a	Literally one of the worst MMO's I have ever played. Graphics are bad, UI is terrible, questing is boring, gameplay in gerneral is lackluster.
5772	0	a	&lt;---(Fallen Earth)- I played this before it came to steam and quit because it sucked balls. The biggest problem was the abysmal map system combined with lack of direction. I thought that would be fixed since it came to steam. I just tried it and its exactly the same stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. There is no excuse for such dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the year 2012. Quit making games that make human beings look like they haven't evolved passed the Atari and Donkey Kong. This is a really crappy game. It feels generic as fk and is a total waste of anyones time. ANYONE.
8249	1	a	Its not best game and not the worst. I really enjoy playing this. If someone tells me its a P2W game, im not listening him. Yes, you have boosters to harvesting, but you can get them for RP (Reward Points). You can buy premium in-game on auctions (of course, you must have some money).
5778	0	a	Absolute trash.
5779	0	a	Pat to win, graphics are terrible, damage output is terrible, doesnt explain how to do anything in the quests just plops them on you, takes an hour to download on steam and then two more hours to download the game in the launcher, wouldnt recomend it to anyone unless you like all these things in you game
5780	0	a	Why is this game so bad? It has to much crap to be good, I don't even know how to start. First off it looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The mechanics is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The whole game i â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Like normal games I atleast know waht to do, in this game I don't I just wander around like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing idiot beacuse im clueless.
8251	1	a	Best shanking simulator there is
5781	0	a	Absolute trash. The mechanics are just... so... wrong. Aiming feels like i'm using a freaking etch-a-sketch. Then looting seems like it freezes the game? I couldn't even finish the tutorial before i felt nauseous. What else can you expect from the creators of APB... Blech.
8253	1	a	Just think a fallout MMORPG... or S.T.A.L.K.E.R, or any other apocalyptic game, but in an MMORPG form. Pretty self explanitory. But i guess i'll go into more detail with my ever-so-rare pros/cons list.   Pros_  MASSIVE open world that would take more than a full day to travel from one side to the other on foot. (but don't worry, there are horses and vehicles to help.)  A bunch of cool secrets to be found.  Interesting roleplaying potential.  Cool story and factions.  (bonus!) The low playerbase gives a good feel of isolation, really gives that extra immersion of an empty wasteland on a dead earth. Though unlike with fallout, having multiplayer makes the few players you will come across, means no two people will have the same experience, and be able to meet people with interesting stories and characters and such. Makes the dead world feel all the more alive.   Cons_  Intense learning curve.  VERY slow paced leveling and such with a lot of 'go here, kill this stuff.' Though it does have the redeeming factor of traveling places you wouldn't go otherwise and seeing interesting scenery.  Not too active playerbase, but the ones that are, luckily, are usually the ones that have been there since the beta.  Old game with dated graphics and stiff controls, though it has aged somewhat decently well.  Support died off ages ago, aswell as updates, for the most part.    Conclusion_  Its an old game, but a good one, and worth the look.
5782	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AldUzWWq8iQ  10/10 would not play this game
8255	1	a	holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game is so good. open. great combat. smooth. addicting. yeah get it. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the negative reviews lol this game is awesome. IT EVEN HAS GREAT LIP SYNC GUYS. PLEASE. THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ MADE ME GET THE MINDSET TO PLAY GAMES THAT ARE ''REVIEWED'' NEGATIVELY AND TRY IT MYSELF FIRST AND HAVE MY OWN OPINION ABOUT IT. but i do read the positive reviews first to put myself up and the game.
5785	0	a	this game sucks you need an account to that game to play it.
5786	0	a	I farmed vegetables for an hour and a half then used the money to buy a book that taught me how to make the first part of a pistol then farmed for an hour and a half to get the money to buy a book to learn to make the second part of the pistol and I repeated this several times. I then had to farm for several more hours to learn to actually MAKE the pistol, then I had to aquire the parts to MAKE the parts then I FINALLY made the pistol and the pistol sucked.    Also the combat sucks  So clunky  Takes forever to get crappy weapons.  Only way to get anywhere faster than traveling through space nowadays is to put money into buying money to get the book to- Yeah, you get the point. Don't play this game unless you want to spend hours on nothing. Or if you're rich or don't know how to save your money.
5787	0	a	It fell flat quite quickly, but you could have fun if you get with others
5788	0	a	Took 7 hours to download and it didn\'t work. 
5789	0	a	I used to view this game positive since it reminds me of my childhood but after playing recently I realised how much this game sucks its like a degraded boring version of Fallout... If you are still playing this then go try fallout already
8257	1	a	This is a Question for the people that made Fallen Earth. I love this but i cant it somehow. I love this game a lot and please respond people that this game.Please.
5790	0	a	This has a whole lot of nothing. So much empty space. its just so boring.
5791	0	a	Actually this game is not in steam at all... you have to create a gamersfirst account and the updater trends to hijack your connection while updating, if you really like to play this don't download it here, go directly to gamersfirst and download the client manually
5792	0	a	Fallout is awesome! Oh, wait this isn't Fallout? Oh yeah it's 'Fallen Earth' don't buy that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
8259	1	a	worst game ever 10/10 would unistall again

8263	1	a	My face hurts ;_; 10.9/10
8265	1	a	PLAY IT! NOW! ITS AMAZING! DONT LISTEN TO THE BAD COMMENTS! GET IT!

5819	0	a	What the hell is this game.
8269	1	a	This game is a preety good game it has been a while since the last time i played it but it was a really good game but it takes a while of getting uset to, But dont expect to fall in love with the game right away you have to give the game a chance. 
5820	0	a	uhh not my type of quiet lame action. if your super board an dont do shiz all day then i might recommend this game. for now thou. hell no. game is dumb.
5821	0	a	this game is s h i t
5822	0	a	do not download youll update and wait to load more then play
5823	0	a	Step 1.) Create account Step 2.) Log in Step 3.) Ok so it's 'getting an update'? Step 4.) Now I'm re-accepting the agreements... Step 5.) Repeat steps 3-4 until the end of time (or until you stop playing)
8271	1	a	Does anyone know why I can't log in? I tried the GS acc and my steam acc and neither have worked. Yes i have validated my acc, and checked my password, and it still doesn't work. Im not giving this game a thumbs down yet, because i still have a bit of faith in it.
8273	1	a	Been a pleasent suprise been looking at it for ages and decided why not! It turns out its a very fun game! also the crafting and pvp is very good fun!
8275	1	a	10/10
8277	1	a	I put in over 100000 Hr and i can say that this game is so MLG PRofesicanl Dwat I Waidsted Awl Myw Money. Its so good that i can say i didnt want to kill my self 30 times in a day when forced to pay this for loosing a bet. Also the admins or so amazing! they like are so mature! They listen to you and make sure all your errors are fixed. Exept all thos times people asked admins for help when they where getting harrased and the admins then harrased them...... So now i will show you how a average joe act on this game..  **** YOU THIS GAME IS GAY **** **** **** *** **** MY MOM JUST TAUGHT ME CUSS WORDS YOU ******* **** *** *** *** *** **   So people are rely friendly and help each other out all the time. This rely is the MMO experience you deserv right?  WRONG    Fallen earth takes the regular consept and makes it better! Example: Long Crafting times Horrible Respawns Ugly World Horrible Quest lines AND OF COURSE! THE BEST PAY TO WIN MOTTO! Erm... I mean ITS THE BEST! 69/420 MLG approved 
5835	0	a	derivative and repetitive. You'll find nothing in this game that every other mmo doesn't have. It's crafting is pointlessly slow and the map is too big and the content too low. Leveling to 20 and entering a new map is tedious and punishing. Don't download it just because it's free. Guild Wars 2 is free now and infinitely better.
8279	1	a	if you can handle the PS2 era graphics and the odd lack of people, you will probibly enjoy this Fallout MMO. its definitly a better RPG then fallout 4 is .
5837	0	a	Its fun if you like ammo crafting simulators.
5838	0	a	I played some of this game it was confusing and the intrest did not last long. If u want a wasteland/apcolypse game get fallout or something else.
5839	0	a	- It takes too much time to master the controls - The quests are boring - The controls are quite complex and should be simplified - Its difficult to navigate to the easier areas of the map - You'll probally never get a horse  - Its fun to play for the first 5 hours
8281	1	a	it too many tools to kill some i can't cont all of them and cars are good to
5840	0	a	Downloaded it because I saw so many good reviews. Was a bit dissapointed and I think the game is overrated.  Would've been decent 10 years ago, but now there are other, better games.
5841	0	a	Doesnt let you log in at all Reall confused
5842	0	a	maximum range of assualt rifle is 40meter.... you got sniper rifle? thats 70meter... i quit it and never come back 
5843	0	a	Not much to say. Buggy, boring. Played with a friend for about two hours before we gave it up.   All in all I'd say this picture sums up the best part of the game:  {LINK REMOVED}  http://tinyurl.com/p5wj2jb   I want my two hours back. (Link is to t i n y u r l . c o m)
8283	1	a	PLAY THIS GAME WITH ME CAUSE I WILL GUIDE YOU TO PLAY LIKE A PRO
5853	0	a	Freemium trash game. You're not allowed to use the chat unless you pay. Can't do half the content unless you pay. Have a money cap unless you pay...  Unplayable unless you pay. 1/10, crappy freemium games that are money greedy. You will regret every minute invested, when a moderator bans you for chatting, or when you find out about the money cap / other p2w aspects, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
8285	1	a	Been a pleasent suprise been looking at it for ages and decided why not! It turns out its a very fun game! also the crafting and pvp is very good fun!
8287	1	a	this game is a mixture of awesomeness, and boringness while you have fun on your adventure of killing things you cant really do much more than trade and buy stuff. But if ur into this kind of stuff then this is the game for you. But if you are the type of person like me and love challenges then i suggest to you starbound it is the most amazing game its better than minecraft and terraria put together with it only being in beta
5857	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥
5858	0	a	i have created almost 5 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing accounts and each and everyone of them are not 'valid' to play the game i waited over and hour for it to download for the game just to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t me? these are the type of people who need to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and get banned from making games
8289	1	a	This game is actually a very well-made game, The people who recently gave review to this game either has a horrible  PC or just can't stand a single second for minor bugs.  I've played this 2-3 years back and it was super fun. It may not have much players now, But its still the fun game i know and love,  I managed to make Soap Mactavish come to life in this game. Couldn't remember the username and password.. it was like 2-3 years ago, Can't blame me.  Either way, Its still a good game. It takes a special person to enjoy this wonderful piece of work. Everyone who disliked this most probably isn't a special kind and just throws in a bad review to make it look bad. Don't worry, This game will be revived sooner or later filled with players,   i'll come back here one day with a ton of players joining me. It only takes a few players to make this game big again, So i ask you.. are you up for the challenge?
8291	1	a	its an awesome free survival game were you can craft stuff,fight zombies , and do missions but the only problem is the tutorial sucks so if there is an option to skip it that would be great :)  
5859	0	a	super boaring game, i dont recommend playing it.
5860	0	a	This looks like a very interesting game to play, unfortunately, I don't know that for certain. Each time that I move my character the game locks up. Not just the locks but it locks up my whole computer so that I have to restart it. Fix that and I'll try it again. Until then I can't recommend this game at all.
5861	0	a	worst game ive ever played
5862	0	a	If Fallot was an endless MMO grind with horrible enemy AI
8293	1	a	Very fun mmo!! fun fallout feel. would reccomend this to anyone that has 3000 hours to spare :)

8299	1	a	a low meh.
8301	1	a	Great game! looks a lot like Fallout3 which I enjoyed playing. Though there are a few glitches as i started. great idea
5876	0	a	this game sucks
5877	0	a	I would quite honestly get a rusty knife, and slowly saw my own arm off, rather than play this game. Then afterwards, I would boil my arm and serve it at the local soup kitchen. This game is god awful, and may god have mercy on whom ever decides it would be a brilliant idea to play it. Dont waste your time.
8303	1	a	is very cool game!!!!!!! BRO!!!!!!!!! 
8305	1	a	RealChris said it all. Reminds me of a kinda 'Fallout Online' Crafting system. Auction system. Mounts. It's probably the best MMORPG i've ever gotten into so far. I'm still pretty new, but so far, this game is worth your time trying. Happy Scavenging!
5886	0	a	this game sucks
5887	0	a	its an alright game but i didnt get what i expected
8307	1	a	This game is good to pass some time and to play a fun not to big rpg
5888	0	a	I dont know whats wrong with this game, but i got a message unable to connect T.T
5889	0	a	So after taking the time to make a cool looking character, I was introduced to the horried controls of this game.  NOT being able to strafe, turn and move backward/forward simultaneously, makes this game completely uninteresting. Which is pretty sad, because the vids and screenshots of this game looked like a lot of fun.  The biggest problem is that I never made it out of the first room you start in. I go to the terminal and it tells me to kill the dude on the right, so I do that and then come back. It then tells me to go and activate some drone terminal or something.  Well there's a terminal there alright, but it doesn't do anything. No button prompting, no hints, no nothing. After walking every where that I could, it dawned on me that I had to activate a terminal to continue. A terminal that is not able to activate.   I give this game an F.  This could be a fun game, ya know, if it were like, playable in some way, and if maybe the devs get their act together.
8309	1	a	its an awesome free survival game were you can craft stuff,fight zombies , and do missions but the only problem is the tutorial sucks so if there is an option to skip it that would be great :)  
8311	1	a	
5890	0	a	This game seems like it would be cool, but i cant get past the first part because the game crashes after i kill the first guy. When i go to options to turn graphics down, it immediantly glitches and closes the option menu out. Take my first experience with the game in consideration when you try to get it. Otherwise, it looks like it would be cool.....if it didnt crash every five seconds.
8313	1	a	this game isnt actuallt free to play :( 
8315	1	a	very addicting game
5892	0	a	This Used to be an ok MMO but has declined quite a bit

5895	0	a	Terrible... This game has lag, poor character movements, and not enough of a character setting. I recommend you get TERA instead that game is so mch better
8317	1	a	  I really enjoyed this RPG game and I enjoyed the first 10 seconds of the charecter creation. The problem I got is when I got to the part were you get your first rifle and you have to go to the Medical bay where the woman said they do operations I have 4 gbs and my frame rates dropped to 2 so I had to fight on 2 fps and I managed to win, I got outside THE VIEW WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!

8321	1	a	it too many tools to kill some i can't cont all of them and cars are good to
5900	0	a	I STRONGLY suggest that anyone who is considering getting this game should reconsider- oh it's free you say? its not worth the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time. let alone your money- this game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing badly made that i swear to god it puts the developers to shame. infact shout out to the developers, dont make awkward controls, boring maps, and ridiculously patronizing intros, unless you are expecting money to grow on trees. played not even two hours of this game 10/10 would uninstall again.

5904	0	a	This game seems like it would be cool, but i cant get past the first part because the game crashes after i kill the first guy. When i go to options to turn graphics down, it immediantly glitches and closes the option menu out. Take my first experience with the game in consideration when you try to get it. Otherwise, it looks like it would be cool.....if it didnt crash every five seconds.

5925	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't enjoy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t that makes no sense. When loading up the game it requires you to make a login, get it verified and all that jazz, but when it comes right down to it, it literally makes no sense at all. There is no username, and if you go into your account, there is a username with a weird series of numbers and letters, and even when putting those in, it does not work, so for those who do not have half an hour to spend â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing around just trying to figure out how to get into the game, it's not good.

5942	0	a	Take Fallout, WoW &amp; STALKER and throw them in the trash. The result is this game.
5943	0	a	Well I don't really know how to start this off so I suppose I will dive right into it. This game is unfortunately a shotty shell of what it seemingly was meant to be. I didn't even play for very long before I got tired of it.   What I don't like:  Non-Intuitive Controls - Seriously, the controls in this game don't make much sense at all. This game is an MMO style game. Most MMO games use the same basic control system for things like interacting with the environment, and looting. This is fixed by spending about 5 minutes remapping the keys to what they SHOULD be for an MMO. It is almost as if the Devs had never played an MMO before to understand what the keyboard layout is. Why are Q and E mapped to 'rotate the character left and right?' What game even has those as keys? Q should be a hotkey ability and E should access looting, same with a right click.  Clunky First Person Mode - Here is the thing about making an MMO with the ability to play in first person. Either polish it to the point where it is remotely functional, or DONT HAVE A FIRST PERSON MODE.  In short, don't waste your time with this game unless the devs decide to make the UI acceptable.
5944	0	a	Radioactive Play-Doh.
5945	0	a	I fully do not recommend this game. For the past six hours I've been trying to get this game to update past 2.35 and every time the game will pop up with a fatal error or the program will stop responding. I've posted on their Facebook whats going on, I'm not the only one who has been having this problem and no one will answer us about it. Other then that part the game looks pretty interesting but good luck actually getting it to run

5969	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
5970	0	a	This game is probably the WORST game I have ever played, I played DOTA and Clicker Heroes. So first of all let's recognize what is good in this game. The Storyline... That is literally it. Oh wait! There is... Nope, nothing. Nothing else at all. First of all, there is absolutely no fighting audio... Not even a gun sound or a cutting through the wind sound when you swing something... BUT there is a death audio. That doesn't even make sense actually, no fight audio BUT HEY LET'S MAKE A DEATH SOUND! Literally hated this game, especially since I spent about eight hours installing this game and then another hour and a half doing the wierd thing it does when you first start up. Oh and I forgot it DOES have two good things, it runs pretty well on my brothers crappy computer but the install took forever on my alienware.... I hate this game and I unistalled it as soon as I couldn't take it anymore.

5997	0	a	Gamersfirst, just what is this company? They are a company who 'buys' games from other companies. They are a company who believes that editing out original authors of game developers is okay. Their game known as Fallen Earth is great; however, the Game Masters of the game are corrupt. For the past few years Fallen Earth has been suffering from multiple pvp aimbotters/duplicaters and many more glitchers/exploiters, and what do they GAME MASTERS do? 'NOTHING' They believe that banning innocent players for no reason is the key, accepting bribes from known aimbotters/cheaters and other sources in order for players who are 'legit' get banned. It's wrong and outrageous and I believe that these Game Masters need to get what they deserve 'FIRED'. Tiggs and Dasterd both do this, sure sure, they are well known the gaming community, well maybe they should of thought about this before accepting money to ban legit gamers. Due to this, I give Fallen Earth a +1 for being a good game and a -9 for the Game Masters behavior. In conclusion, this game has received yet another 'Negative' review and Gamersfirst should be more cautious as to who they hire.

6034	0	a	I see other beta testers here, sorrys all around.  I had bad expieriences with their GM team, basically playing pocket sausage with their alt- characters and clans. I have heard from others that they have the same problem.   Link is picture of what I am talking about  http://i.imgur.com/z3Wc69A.png    Basically, the game is run like a spoiled kids plaything, because GMs ingame have little oversight and do not really care about keeping up the playerbase. It is rotting in its prime. And a shame, because it had really great mechanics when it first was introduced years ago.
8375	1	a	This game has pretty much everything, except the usual dragons and things like that and thats the main part of the reason i like the game, im so fed up with RPGs always being some kind of D&amp;D spinoff.  I joined FE when it was still rather new and the seamless huge world in which it takes place, really appealed to me.  At some point though, this game went F2P instead of subscription based as it used to be and thats about when i stopped playing, because it became much like the channel packages u get u choose from at ur cable provider, where the basic setting contains all the crappy channels and the channels u really want, only comes in a bundle where u pay for 5 channels to get that single channel u actually do want.  I liked it better when FE was subsctription based, everyone contributed the same and everyone was equally set in the world of FE, no one had special advantages and the same amount of in-game effort, would earn anyone the same amount of gain.  Apart from that, the game has a ton of hrs of fun, especially if u team up with other players and maybe even join or found a clan.  The crafting system is brilliant, crafting takes quite some time (unless they changed it since i played that is), i recall it taking like 2 or 3 rl minutes to make a bandage and 10 mins to craft a small batch of ammo.  Crafting things like mounts, may take up to several days depending on the level of the mount and while that may seem like a lot, it soon becomes very natural in the game as u dont find urself waiting around for crafts to complete, because u actually learn to plan ur crafting and that becomes a part of the game that contributes to full experience in a very good way.  There are safe areas where other players wont be able to attack u and that makes it possible to settle as a crafter/merchant with little or no fighting skills and as u can have more chrs, u can do good by building a 'money farmer' to supply ur fighter chr with money.  Missions are good and works well and u are free to complete the missions over and over again to farm special drops, xp etc.   Beware that like i said, its been quite some time since i stopped playing and some things may have changed. The only change im pretty sure of that hasnt happend but has been awaited since the game came out, is player housing, that part unfortunately doesnt exist, so everything u gather in game will have to be stored in 'vaults'.  The vault system works well though, its put together of different vault types where some vaults appear more often than others, so the stuff u need the most, will have to go into the standard vault in order to be easily accessed from 'anywhere'.  The vaults has a fixed amount of slots and ofc u can buy more slots by paying money, but at least (afaik) its still a one time fee.  When u pay real money, u can get your xp gain furthered and basically it means, if u wanna level at a descent and not too boring speed, u will have to pay and so it goes for other things as well.  Id still vote that this game goes back to subscription based, so that a good handfull of the players wont have to pay for all of those who play for free.  The only good thing about F2P is that u get to try before u buy, but that couldve been achieved with a normal demo, i seem to recall that when i joined FE, it had a demo that allowed u to play until u reached level 15 or so, after that u couldnt level any further.  Playing until level 15 were more than enough to decide whether to buy the game or not.
8377	1	a	Top notch old school MMO. Very detailed, and somewhat complicated. Definately not dumbed down like some of the newer games. This one has been around awhile, but is still well worth playing. The fighting is done in more of a FPS type. Heavy crafting, almost everything in the game can be crafted. It's set in a post apocalyptic wasteland, and you have mounts like motorcycles and cars. It can be time consuming, but is an excellent game and I recommend it to everyone. It can be truly played for free and has a good payment model.

6075	0	a	Horrible game. Srsly. Why would you play something like this!? _:
6076	0	a	I'd recomend it, but the Devs are lazy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s that only care about money, and not the players. They won't get up off their lazy asses and update the game, as the graphics are outdated, and it's full of bugs and glitches, leveling up it painfully slow (at least for me, anyways) it lags like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and there's loads of spammings in the help chat when you are trying to ask a question if you're at the time when Cylen isn't on.   However there's the good side. You can get helpful players that get bored of the game, and go around helping people. The missions aren't too hard wth a friend, and it's really helpfull to join clans, ecxept some can have control freak â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s as leaders, so it's best to join a small clan, as this way it's all closer and easier to communicate with clan members.  Pro's:   Helpful players  Nice missions  Addicting  Con's:  Lazy Devs will never update this game again  Graphics outdated  Full of Bugs  Leveling up is painfully slow  Lags like a baws  Spammers and adbots in chat   My rating: 4/10

8391	1	a	If you are one of those 100% completion types, this will keep you occupied for a very very long time. i have over 200 hours in this game, and i still haven't even left the first major area. and i still have quite a bit more to do yet before i will move on.    also good if you are a cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like me. all that time in, and i've spent no real money. i may not ever(sorry devs) because i can gather and craft anything i might need.   not for the impatient. some things can take a very long time(days) to craft, and only one at a time.
6084	0	a	steam please stop recommending this game to me it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible
6085	0	a	THE WORST MMO I'VE EVERY PLAYED! I wanted to kill myself like the samurai did in japan....... 80 minutes I'll never get back D:
8393	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I CAN WRITE A RIVEW , WELL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ASS GAME 0/10
6088	0	a	This I can honestly say without a minor fragmant of doubt, is the worst MMO I've ever played in my entire life. I say that with full knowledge of Quest64.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tutorials, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ controls, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics.  It wouldn't update at first no matter WHAT I did. Then after working my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥ off it finally decided ot MAYBE just download. Don't bother with this, it looks good from the pictures, but let me tell you, when a game let's you go in first person, BUT only when you back up into a wall, your game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (Due to alot of backlash towards most of my reviews because little kids can't seem to understand what an 'opinion' is and get angry and overreact at something sticking out of the pervervial line, I must leave a warning. Thanks kids!)  This is my opinion, I make these reviews to get my opinion out there, if you disagree, I'm not saying my opinions are fact, in which case, no need to get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off at something as trivial as a 'review' or 'opinion' I have an opinion and a mind that proccesses things and I like to let them be known rather than sheltered, weather it be good or bad. I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion on anything, if you disagree, calmly, put my thoughts into perspective, and see if you agree or not. If you don't want to do that and would rather rage over my opinion, then don't look at reviews, you're not mature enough to handle them.

6161	0	a	this game is so fliping gay i cryied brcaues how fliping lame it is  ^  dat grammer
8403	1	a	it is a good MMO I like it it is not the best but not the worst
6162	0	a	Didn't care for the early game mechanics.  I feel other games can offer better packages of this theme.
6163	0	a	I did not get to play the game, since the game kept freezing about 10 seconds after my character started moving, I could stand in one spot for up to 5 minutes, which is the most amout of time I was willing to wait, and then the game would freeze after a few steps.  Hard to review a game that won't work properly.. and before anybody says anything, yes, I did try using the launcher fix tool, I went as far as uninstalling and downloading again.. just to be met by the same error.  So yes, it could be my computer, but then, I can play other games without them crashing every few seconds, so maybe it's not all on my side.
8405	1	a	I must admit, I thought I was going to HATE this game straight from the intro. So much so in fact, that I had tried it before and quit almost immediately! But with a little bit of motivation from my friend Monstar, I whent passed the horrid introduction, and was pushed into an open world environment full of adventure and intricacy!  Fallen Earth is a highly community based, adventurous, and well-balanced post-apoc MMO. If you are a fan of the Fallout series, you will most definately love Fallen Earth, as it is very similar in appearance mood. The community is very tight and helpful, boosted by the finely balanced economy and trading system. The community is also enriched by the placement of 6 factions that hold alliances as well as enemies.  The only caviot to playing fallen earth is it's lack of satisfying combat as well as it's difficulty when it comes to leveling (seriosly it takes AGES) But as long as you keep an open mind and are willing to spill quite some time into this game, I can assure you that you will have a good time. Just as long as you can get through the intro.
6165	0	a	Looking at this, I was expecting a Fallout-ish experience. I was mistaken, but not by much. Don't let the play time fool you, I played a good 50 hours of this outside of Steam. Pros: -Crafting -Exploration -Factions -Multiple starts -Many weapons -Steampunk feel -Reminiscent of New Vegas without being a clone -Very open  Cons: -Glitchy -Crafting system is a bit confusing -PvP is populated almost entirely by hackers -Optimizatin is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ -Players are generally ill-tempered -AI isn't verry Intelligent -Quests can be a handful at times -Aiming likes to twitch, making long-range shots hard -Leveling system is a pain  Neutral: -Tutorial can be a bit confusing on your first run through -Graphics are a bit dated -Kinda empty (Not sure if they're going for the 'Wasteland' feel)  Overall, it's fun to play with friends for a week or two, but not something I'd sink another 50 hours into
6166	0	a	The game felt old for 2011, let alone 2015, don't bother.
6167	0	a	i got the game and i wanted to make a acount on it and i did not use my email on it and it said i did 
8407	1	a	fun looking game can not wait to lvl up
8409	1	a	yes it is a good fallout like game 
8411	1	a	Like an MMO Fallout game...hard to explain unless you try it yourself. I sorta enjoyed it for the hour or so I played it, so yeah.
8413	1	a	Like Fallout but multiplayer :D
6168	0	a	if you like pans i recomend u not bplay balogna bcus it if butts
8415	1	a	love this game give it a try
6169	0	a	The game isnt even the glitchyist part... The launcher was. After I signed out for my first time and tried to sign back in I was forced to uninstall the game and redownlad it. But other than that one part it was a good game.
8417	1	a	by far one of the best mmo i have ever played  comunity 8/10 gameplay 9.2/10 music 6/10 weapons 9.7/10 mobiles 8.6/10 
8419	1	a	To put this game simple here are the pros and cons  Pros -The crafting systm is unique and refreshes your gameplay experince giving you better gameplay  -The game is open world giving you many places to travel -The looting system is common and easy to understand -The enemys in the game are unique from other characters you will see in games -The game is free to play -The game is not pay to win  Cons -The graphics are not the best -The game makes alot of people lag even with a good running system -The game has alot of bugs and when the server has to do maintenence it will take it awhile -The NPC seem dead they dont talk much -The Combat in the game is not the funniest thing you will do -The hud is all over the screen  Overall Graphics-5/10 Gameplay-7/10   So out of 20 i gave it a 12 but if you like free then this is your game    
6170	0	a	OK, I am not saying anything about the game (in fact never played the game), but i am saying somthing about the account system. The account system is the worst thing since the Pet Rock (thats an actual thing). The reason it's bad is because I can't login. Every acount I make from Gamerfirst I can't play with. So I make the account, then put my email, THEN my computer crashes. But it saves my email and nothing else. So when i try and make a new account, since it saves my email I can't make a new account. I can't login because the account doesn't exist. This happened every time with every game. Again not played the game, Just wasted an hour of my life on an account that is not real...
8421	1	a	Pretty good
8423	1	a	This is one of those mission type/salvaging MMO's. I really enjoy this one. If you donâ€™t have this game, get it. Though if you have a normal computer, I would recommend you change the game graphic settings to their absolute lowest. If you do that, should be fine, otherwise you will rage quit from lagging to the point where you die from it. Because it is a 100% online game (no single player mode), most of the high end graphics is not needed.  Over all I really like this game. The lay out is great, I can play for hours at a time, and there are hundreds of achievements to try and unlock.  (8.9 out of 10)
8425	1	a	i can't login,so i can't get on to atually play someone please help. t
8427	1	a	Hello, Now i dont really play to many MMOs but from learning and knowing alot about them i have some knowledge on them. This game is one of the best games ive played in a while. And yes i only have 5 hours into this game but so far it is a great game.   Weapons-There are a huge amount of weapons in fallen earth, weather its melee weapons like spiked bats or swords to guns like sniper rifles pistols and a bunch of other weapons.  Armor-There are a bunch of cloths and armor that you can get in the game which help protect yourself  Crafting-This is one of the big ones. There is alot of things to craft weather its crating ammo , weapons ,Armor , food , and a bunch of other things.  enemys-There are bunch of monsters and people that you will come across and kill. Theres bosses and alot of hard things to fight, but when you have the right gear and weapons some enemys will become easy to kill but there are alot of hard enemys that ly ahead.  Map-The map is giant! its broken up into sectors with different areas and biomes and you can come a across many things while you roam the land.  Friends-I like to play with friends this game is very fun with a group of friends and take out bosses , fortresses , etc...  PVP-Now i havent done or encountered this. but There are pvp areas all around the map huge areas to where you can kill other players build bases together raid peoples bases and have epic battles.  This is by far one of the best games ive ever played i give this 10/10  Hope to see you in the atomic wasteland! :)
8429	1	a	I like this game, it's very easy to play.
8431	1	a	Most people will compare this instantly to the Fallout series, the only thing they share in common as far as I'm concerned is the Post Apoc setting for the world. The game plays more like Neocron, Hellgate London or STALKER.  The game play requires some getting used for people who've never played a hybrid interface game as there is a toggle between Aim/Fight mode and RPG mode. In Aim/Fight mode the game behaves like a FPS. While in RPG mode the mouse cursor is free so you can click on menu items, objects, and such. Many people make the mistake of skipping the tutorial, a really big mistake as a lot of the basic how to's are taught through the tutorial.  Fallen Earth literally has a spider web of story especially in Sector 1 (the beginners sector) where various stories from starter towns and the later higher level towns actually come together or are related enriching the experience. Much more to say, but not much space left to type. . . give it a honest try and enjoy it for what it is
6172	0	a	only the desperate and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ would enjoy this.
8433	1	a	The map is huge. Biggest map ive ever seen. Play it for good looks
8435	1	a	If you enjoy large-world games this may be one for you. The crafting system is large and complex and the dusty plains provide a very fitting frame for the story. There's the option of going for missions or crafting as you level up, either way will make your character progress as you play. The GUI was daunting at first but after a few hours it felt more comfortable to use - but never easy or intuitive. As it stands now I'm on the verge of putting real money into the game, since I feel the developers have created a world that pulls me where other post-apocalyptic games have had a plastic, artificial feel to them. If you enjoy exploration and crafting, definitely try out this free to play version at the very least!
8437	1	a	What is Fallen Earth? Fallen Earth like a MMO Metro 2033 only minus Russians talking in English with silly Reznov voices.
6175	0	a	Post apocaliptic??? Survival game??? WTF, It feels like an mmo, not a survival game. 10/10 ign
8439	1	a	Awesome mixture of rpg HUD + 3rd/first person shooting. WORTH
8441	1	a	Really great game, but i fail to understand the negative review..
6177	0	a	This game is bad, like really bad, itÂ´s so boring, looks ancient, and itÂ´s very uninteresting.
6178	0	a	Honestly all I have to say is GamersFirst. Yeah, sure. Those guys are just trying to milk as much money from the Community of die-hard fans as possible before shutting the thing down. Game hasn't gotten ANY attention from the devs except for more micro-transactions.   Here's a micro-Transaction example: You can craft Cars in this game. And there is one really cool car. The fastest one with the biggest trunk and overall no other vehicle in the game is even close to beeing a competition to it. Now, if you want that car, you can craft for ages, hell, crafting the car takes ATLEAST 1 week, not farming the stuff for it, no, I mean the actual process of crafting it takes 1 Week. (Except if you pay real money you can boost it a really big ammount) The other way to get it is just to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy it in the shop. Yay.   Also: Player customization. Character creation is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and all characters look ugly as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. How do you fix an ugly Character? Awesome Clothing, you are absolutely right sir. Now when you first start the game, you notice the 'Wardrobe' slot in your gear-menu. Except the slots don't seem to work. huh. You have to buy the slots in PACKAGES. Or pay a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of money (I think it was arround 20 bucks) to get all of them.   And one of my absolute favourites is the endgame PvE: You have to buy an Shop-Item to summon the bosses. Yup. I just said it.   Not everything about the game is bad tho. It feels really rewarding when you build your first Dune buggy for example. I'm pretty sure you won't find any matches nowadays but I really had fun in PvP-Battlegrounds, atleast the Deathmatch one, but its Probably everyone using the exact same build in endgame.  It's for free, so check it out if you really want this to be good, but it's basically dead already.  And also read some other Reviews, everyone who's talking about the Enemy AI; the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Combat system or the boring Quests is absolutely right.
8443	1	a	Very interesting game.  It makes me feel as if im playing a Fallout Online-ish type game.  The game is pretty old (released in 2011!), but it still shines with the better MMOs wih some decent gameplay. The graphics arent the greatest as well as the UI being a bit on the griany side.  I will say this again: I prefer having solid gameplay over amazing visuals. This game has it in spades.  The map is HUGE, and im only in the first area. i hear there is 3 or 4 maps?  I was a huge fan of the skill system in the edler scrolls games ( the more you do something, the better you get at it, and the better stuff you can make/ use), and am glad its implimented in this game; though its not very clear that you have to buy the skills first off ( in game money ) from trainers. Im pretty sure that is covered in the toutorial, but i blew through that bad boy like i was a seasoned WoW quest grinder /sadface.... yes click yes click yes click  From what a friend who beta tested and played copiuos hours afterwards told me, was, that the character system is much like The Secret World, where you can continually change your skills in and out as you see fit. You're not stuck with one type of weapon or another. You want to use an LMG? Find the skills required, build them up, then equip the gun. Same with armors and everything else you can use.  Oh, and basically this is a crafting MMO. You RARELY if ever get guns dropping off mobs. You build al;most EVERYTHING. See that guy off in the distance on the Harley? Yeah, you can make one eventually. Get ready for some serious time drain though. Each item you craft has a real life time to make. Based on your applicable skills (for the type of crafting you are attempting), you can lower the amount of time it takes to make stuff. Just dont be suprised when you see that the engine you need to make for your sweet ride takes 24 hours to craft. BUT: you can craft and quest at the same time. Thank the gods.  Im very interested in seeing how the Mutant powers work. Yes, mutant powers. Basically spells. And there is quite a few branches of types. some are for damage, some are healing, some are buffs, and others are a good balance in between. I have no experience with them yet, so sorry im no use to you there.  With a little under 5 hours ingame, i would have to rate this at the following:  GRAPHICS: 7/10 not awful, but not anything super polished like the MMOs that have relased in the last few years.  GAMEPLAY: 8/10 Some minor glitches here and there, which shouldnt be since this game is this old...  CONTROLS: ugh... 6/10 Get ready to remap some keys right off the bat. Once you get the WASD set to NORMAL (A &amp; D to turn, not strafe), its easier. But, never forget that Shift isnt Run. the '/' key changes your speed through 3 settings.  SOUND: 9/10 I'm only in the first area, so i havent heard much other than some random screams when mobs die, a few towns people, and some weapons being shot off. What i have heard is great though.  overall i will give this game a standing 8/10. I will update as i play through, though im sure the 'score' i gave it can only go up; based on what ive heard from my buddy who has a maxed out toon.
8445	1	a	EAT THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ITS GOOD
8447	1	a	A good game but the grinding takes to long the game could have some better missions they get boring overtime .... 
8449	1	a	great game most fun woth friends a must try for all mmo players
8451	1	a	I have started playing this game this week and have found it to be a enjoyable one. the game is much like fallout if you liked that game then you would enjoy. the graphics are ok but i find that this gives this game a diffrent feel and in away the fact theat their not amazing has given it a diffrent look and aspect and me personal enjoye this about it as now a days its all about the graphics and this gives a brake from that. thir seems to be a problem with the landscape loading and then doesent buffer as well as not a frecent movement seem to be laggey ( friends have had same problem) but besides that what i have played so far is enjoyable. i would recomend this game to people who enjoy games like fallout.hope you have the same enjoyment i have had and i hope it continuse thought the game for me
8453	1	a	cool and addicting game that is basically free if you want to blow several hours a day playing -- this is the game if you don't have hours of time to spend goofing off--DO NOT DOWN LOAD THIS
8455	1	a	Why write a review / describe my first impression when I can do a video?   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1slzP92IGD4  note: this was one of my earlier reviews / first impressions.

8457	1	a	Eh its ok
8459	1	a	Awesome game. Too many quests though at one time. Wish my computer wouldnt lag with it.
8461	1	a	Very similar to Planet Calypso without the real money economy, space travel and a more Fallout 3 setting. However for a Free to Play game it's great and if I didn't already play Planet Calypso I would be playing this!
8463	1	a	good, deep, and long playing game u cant get boring !!!!!!!!
6184	0	a	its so bad dont download 
8465	1	a	So far It's quite very nice. Had fun playing it
8467	1	a	A decent post-apocalyptic MMO with a deep crafting system and a lot of content. Not really pay-to-win either. Definitely worth a try if the genre appeals to you or you want an MMO with something a little different to offer.
8469	1	a	fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things
8471	1	a	I've had so much fun running around, picking up bits of plastic :)
8473	1	a	play this awsome game 
6185	0	a	monotonous and boring. also a cash cow pay to win.
8475	1	a	game is gr8 m8, i'd r8 it 8/8 don't h8
8477	1	a	A great free to play MMO which has elements similar to games like Fallout and Fallout New Vegas, it also gives the choice of third or first person perspective. It also has vehicles such as motorbikes and also horses. A great free to play MMO experience overall.
8479	1	a	Great game lots of fun, Although somepeople pay2win, It's a lot funner too play through without paying a thing. Great crafting system, Great combat. Overall 10/10. :)
8481	1	a	10/10 it's aight
8483	1	a	This game has really great atmosphere. That is because most of the content is ripped straight from the Wasteland/Fallout universe. If you ever wanted to play a Fallout-ish MMO, this is the best choice. It's more focused on crafting and the whole 'carrot on the stick' gameplay, and of course you can just buy the carrot. I really enjoyed the short time I spent in game.  I'm torn about this game because, quite frankly, the community is just awful. Instead of Zone chat like in most mmo's, there's a Help chat. It's filled with players that have been there for a while, but most of them have that whole 'elite' attitude. Help chat is supposed to be used for people with questions, thus the name. These 'Elitists' will use Help chat for anything they want, berate and accuse new players of trolling, then turn around and lecture everyone on the 'proper way' to use Help chat. The GM's are even worse. They constantly hand out mutes/bans, but ignore any complaints towards the preffered players that have been there for a long time or spent probably $500 in the cash shop.   Also, the GM's are crazy about censoring peoples' screen names. I had a name that wasn't even offensive, I played for a bit and when I came back, my name was Cupcake1244. Yes, if they deem your name offensive, you get to roam the Wastelands as Cupcake____. And you only get 1 character slot as a F2P player. I contacted a GM about changing my name and guess what? Oh, you can BUY a name change in the cash shop. $10 because you got offended for no reason? Hah!  Unfortunately, I'm the type of person that's going to argue right back with you when you're acting douchey. So I told everyone off in Help chat and am uninstalling :)   To sum it up, if you enjoy the crafting side of mmo's with a Fallout/Wasteland atmosphere, go for it. But if you're not going to spend money on it, I'd suggest that you keep the chat window closed and just chat with people locally. You're going to want to avoid these Basement-Dwellers.
8485	1	a	really good
6190	0	a	bow down to the wwestgoat
8487	1	a	Good points: A good storyline. OK FPS (shooter) Good FPS (frames) Good customization on characters. OK weapons.  Bad points: A LOT of trolls Tons of idiots A few glitches You can't get past a certain stage. It just crashes and I have a lot of RAM, storage and more.  7/10, tries to be Fallout, slightly fails, still OK game. 
6192	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
6193	0	a	wtf is this
8489	1	a	Most people overlook Fallen Earth because its a F2P game, but you'd be suprised what it has to offer. Multiple maps that are extensive in size, the ability to craft over 90% of the items used in-game and the massive amounts of players that join everyday. This is a game I would recomend to any fan of MMORPGs, Post-Apocalyptic games or those who enjoy team combat.
6194	0	a	If your the kind of person who thinks shoving broken glass in your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is relaxing leisure, then you will LOVE this game.
6195	0	a	Made 3 accounts and its still not working. I hate this anti-DRM â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. ITS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING F2P SO WHY DO I NEED A G1ST PROFILE?
8491	1	a	Its a fun game, but it can be very buggy!
6197	0	a	NOT GOOD AT ALL
8493	1	a	Fallen Earth is cool
8495	1	a	itÂ´s a good game, a bit difficult the further into the game you get. However, some obstacles have not stopped anyone from trying until you passed it. Any good gamer can agree.
8497	1	a	its REALLY. i mean REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY laggy close to the start of the game. im not going to give any spoilers but close to where u meet the first people that tha help u. im talk extremly laggy. but mabey it can be fixed in the otions, how knows, but i sorda like the idea of the game
8499	1	a	I greatly reccommend this game to people who enjoy story, and crafting aspects, but perhaps not for the people who just want to shoot things. If you're into the latter, then it will also be good for you if you want to partake in pvp or wander and kill things. All around it's a solid game without any of the overly-intrusive money making opportunities that most F2P games take. If you have the money, then you should definitely support the creation of new content for a very solid game.
8501	1	a	I don't recomend this game. I haven't even played it...and that's the problem. It takes forever just to check for updates. When you actually get in the game, there's no cursor or anything. It's hard to push any buttons it displays. I can't even click the freakin PLAY button. If this happens to you, don't even bother. If it doesn't, play away.
8503	1	a	Its like DayZ but with no zombies and fallout without the demon things
6201	0	a	In the grim darkness of future, there is only war. But not here. Here, you will find a desolate land with funny people running around, lame excuses of a storyline, traces of developers' sloth and indifference, ancient graphics, grinding and... Long story short: I've played worse. But that's hardly a recommendation.
8505	1	a	this game is just like fallout
8507	1	a	Fallen Earth has ups and downs, in my opinion. It has a massive world, with lots of different choices.  And some of the downsides are things like all the good armour looks like it just hopped out of an 80s movie, and you have to be perfectionist careful to level up properly, or else your entire character is doomed.
8509	1	a	Pretty fun, takes a bit longer to level up with spending money, but all in all still a pretty fun game!!!!
8511	1	a	Though it felt a bit dated even when it was released, Fallen earth is still a interesting and fun game. Can be a bit complicated but still fun.
6203	0	a	Not very pretty, Too much MMO-like gameplay
8513	1	a	I recomend this game if ur interest in a mmo tps or fps zombie game thats open world.
8515	1	a	I totally recommend this game. i know like most free to play MMO's there is a cap on what you can do with the free account but its not low enough to really bother you. I personally like the crafting in the game. i like the fact that you can find nearly everything you need in the open world or collecting it from things/people you killed. Most of the players are really friendly and willing to help! I do think that the tutorial should maybe be a little longer as i dont think that it really explains enough to understand the game when you enter the world. I also love the fact that you get to craft vehicles for transport. The fact that the map is sooooooooooooooooo big i mean its huge. AWESOME game. One of my FAVS!!!!!! I really dont think i have come across anything that i dont like about it :) 10/10
8517	1	a	i [played this for a while it was very fun in a fallout 3 kinda way, however if you do not like faction systems or pvp than this is not the game for you. Its like Fallout, Meets Guild Wars, i guees to most accurately describe it.
8519	1	a	Well after a bit of time spent to this game you can say it's cool and not.   This game has a lot of pottential, It has a verry well made story line with a lot of world events arround that will allow you to grather, level and have fun as a lone wolf or with your friends.   The Engine the game has it's old as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and it's all glitchy and laggy due the G1 not supporting FE development enough but still i think you should give it a try when you have time, It's all about getting out of sector one wich is the worst place of them all, after that the S2 PvP S3/Deadfall/The District and /PvP is quite funny and entertaining. Level 55 PvP is not the best but not the worst either, to much drama honnestly.   The best thing about it as a F2P is that it's truly F2P. You can do a quick 5 min survery and buy the cheapest item from the marketplace with like 5 G1C and unlock the 10 Red Chips money cap wich is the only thing that hold you back a little. I've so far invested about 5 minnutes into the marketplace and 0.00$ into the game since it went F2P.    Crafters might want to buy commander though, It'll speed up the crafting stuff quite a lot and It allows you to have a larger crafting que.
8521	1	a	Perfect game for absolutely free. It is a game right at you finger tips if you like genre.
8523	1	a	This is alot like fallout new vages i think that is what they call it but this is a very good multiplayer game and a RPG game.I recommend this to people who like multiplayer games or RPG (role playing games) then i recommend this game.
6205	0	a	could only play for 5 sec before the game crashed and when ever i log back again the same thing happen... oh and appearnly i cant access the options of the game anymore for no reason -.-
6206	0	a	Had high hopes for this game when I saw it, but some of the little things in the game put me right off within minutes such as, you cannot move your head whilst jumping, the stupid look when you have your fist inside your own gun among other issues. I have only just played the tutorial and I imagine I will have another play of this game and see what I think after another hour or so, but till then, the little things irk me too much. Obviously I am not patient enough to deal with these things, and while I do not reccommend it I believe that others would find it alot more enjoyable than I. I will play again and re-review if I find it more fun next time!
6207	0	a	They would not give me a motorbike 0/10  but in all seriousness this game is horrible.
8525	1	a	Some of my best gaming memories comes from this game
6208	0	a	It has bugs, it wont let me open the options menu and it freezes everytime i use the scroll to zoom in.
8527	1	a	if fallout and some random mmo made a baby fallen earth would be it this game has a lot of amazing things that have been put together but the thing that i love the most is that you could have your wepon on your right hand left hand or if you have two you can duel wield so thats about it thanks for watching
8529	1	a	Great Game Althogh M For Mature Great Just Like GTA I Would Give It A Like :D
8531	1	a	there are few open world games which cost ($) but this one is free with third-person view as well as first-person view with nice weapons but the annoying creatures that want to kill you run the same pace so its had to esccape and when I ran I died at least 4 times in a row!
8533	1	a	Tl;Dr: Only just started playing (13hrs), but I'm already impressed. Imagine a mashup of: Star Wars Galaxies, EvE, Fallout, Mad Max, Revolution and Firefly and you're somewhere in the right place.  -----------------------------  I used to play Star Wars Galaxies, right from Beta until just before it closed and I've often looked for a game to fill the open world sandbox void that left behind. Fallen Earth really comes very close that that (actually it's better than SWG in almost every possible way - add houses and the ability to freely decorate and some equivalent of Space Ship combat and you've got a winner!).  The crafting system has good depth and is a heavily supported part of the game (lots to make, player auctions and pretty much every item is craftable). It's a true open world and seems to have an active community. I'm enjoying the combat system which is pretty much a FPS/3rd person style with the addition of having hotkey special actions.   The skill system is good, very open and it seems to be totally classless, you just level up the skills you want to use and can mix and match as much as you like (It reminds me of EvE in this respect). Most actions seem to earn you xp, so pretty much everything you do helps you level up, but I've not felt pressured into levelling at all.  The screenshots are a lie, the game doesn't look like that at all - or rather, you never see the game like that. I suggest watching some gameplay videos on Youtube to get a good idea what the game looks and plays like.  It 'feels' a lot like Skyrim/Fallout to me.  The missions/quests are actually really well done. They feel much more dynamic than those in most MMO's. There's nothing mind-blowing about them, but they are about as good as traditional fetch/kill/craft quests can get.  Haven't tried PVP at all, so far it seems to be either non-existant or a very tiny part of the game (at least in the area I'm currently in).   There are also dynamic events in the world, they appear to be little theme-park style things. I don't know how limited time they really are but they give the impression that they come and go, which is pretty cool.  Definitely one of the best MMO's I've played - nothing truly ground-breaking, but everything it does it does very well. I anticipate many hours of good fun with this game. The Free2play system isn't abused, mostly it's just timer buffs, a few extra crating/backpack slots and vanity items. I've not paid for anything yet and I've not felt at all like I'm being forced to pay if I want to get anywhere in the game, though because I haven't been forced to I'm very much inclined to look into the subscription to see what's on offer.
8535	1	a	If you can't wait for a Fallout MMORPG, then here's the closest thing. You'll have to live without V.A.T.S., but since I don't see how that would work in multiplayer without making it turn-based anyway, this will more than satisfy your needs for a giant post-apocalyptic world to explore and survive in. Plus crafting i s awesome. Oh and ENDLESS ways to personalize your character&lt;3
8537	1	a	only made it to lvl ten, but so far it is a fun game to play. Plus its free can't beat that.
8539	1	a	Simply one of the best MMO's. It's complicated enough to get rid of all the kids. And not too complicated to keep it at a Mature level. This game is for grown ups who want to use some brain while doing things instead of just hitting 2 buttons and changing looks.
8541	1	a	A good Post-apocalyptic game.  Sorta confusing and not knowing what to do at first but you get there.  Haven't spent much time on it but it's a good game.
8543	1	a	To put this game simple here are the pros and cons  Pros -The crafting systm is unique and refreshes your gameplay experince giving you better gameplay  -The game is open world giving you many places to travel -The looting system is common and easy to understand -The enemys in the game are unique from other characters you will see in games -The game is free to play -The game is not pay to win  Cons -The graphics are not the best -The game makes alot of people lag even with a good running system -The game has alot of bugs and when the server has to do maintenence it will take it awhile -The NPC seem dead they dont talk much -The Combat in the game is not the funniest thing you will do -The hud is all over the screen  Overall Graphics-5/10 Gameplay-7/10   So out of 20 i gave it a 12 but if you like free then this is your game    
6216	0	a	OK, I am not saying anything about the game (in fact never played the game), but i am saying somthing about the account system. The account system is the worst thing since the Pet Rock (thats an actual thing). The reason it's bad is because I can't login. Every acount I make from Gamerfirst I can't play with. So I make the account, then put my email, THEN my computer crashes. But it saves my email and nothing else. So when i try and make a new account, since it saves my email I can't make a new account. I can't login because the account doesn't exist. This happened every time with every game. Again not played the game, Just wasted an hour of my life on an account that is not real...
6217	0	a	Fallen Earth is very fun! Except that it didn't save my 6 hours of game-play! So there's no point in playing.
8545	1	a	by far one of the best mmo i have ever played  comunity 8/10 gameplay 9.2/10 music 6/10 weapons 9.7/10 mobiles 8.6/10 
6218	0	a	without spending money, it just sucks: limited crafting, limited everything.
8547	1	a	played it before. wanna try it again. =D
8549	1	a	this game is awsome not like any mmorpg but its more fps and that make it awsome
8551	1	a	An A-OK Post-Apoc MMORPG and believe me most Post-Apocs MMORPGs suck!
8553	1	a	For someone who does not play FPS, I found this game quite enjoyable. It is not solely FPS though - you can switch to a third-person view as well. I like that versatility and the game play itself is enjoyable in my opinion. The ability to carry multiple weapons at once as well as switch them effortlessly in a fight is my favorite part of this game. So if you run out of ammunition, switch to your ax quickly and hack away at enemies before they can take you down. I also really like that there are PVP areas and the entire game is not a free for all. That is what usually steers me away from FPS games, the thought of walking up to a vendor and someone just taking me out and running off. I've experienced this and it is annoying.   The other feature I really like is the real time crafting system. You can craft while doing other things as well so you aren't stuck in one place waiting for an item to finish. In all honesty, it feels like a game that is more enjoyable with friends, which is the only reason I don't have it now but it can be good for some solo play. It's one of the good games in the free to play category, I'd definitely recommend it as I have a few times now. In fact, I am grabbing it again as I type this right now. I give Fallen Earth 10/10
8555	1	a	the games sucks u need to make an acount because it doesnt use ur steam acount also when u make an acount it desnt even let u pres create new acount ITS SO STUPID
8557	1	a	Just another boring old MMO right? WRONG!! This game is absolutely uh not that addictive tho but it is decent.The most decent game I had ever played.The game started in a wasteland where you are a clone.If you had played Fallout before then the game is a bit similar to this except this is an MMO.The game is really fun to play with especially the blood sport.The blood sport is a PVP arena where you play Team DeathMatch,Capture the Flag and so on.The best part is this game is not I repeat NOT PAY 2 WIN!! You can basically get anything you want in this game using the in-game currency which is 'chips'.The community is really helpful and not annoying at all.If you need any help in the game you should just ask in the chat and one of the members will help you out.They are all friendly in the game.This game deserve 7/10
8559	1	a	This game offers lots to do for mmo gamers at every level. The maps are large and look the part. Enemies vary to keep things interesting and generally fit in their environment on the map. Crafting is a HUGE part of this game and can be time consuming but it is done in a way that players can queue up tasks for offline time. Character can be built with skills chosen by the player and customized to fit playstyle. Quests are available in the game but are optional.  Personally the crafting element of the game is my favorite. It brings together the need to scavenge and find the parts you need to craft to advane further into the game.  If you enjoy a sandbox mmo that doesn't marshal you through it's world from start to finish and you enjoy the genre, I would recommend trying this game.  (This review is based off playtime from before the game was offered on Steam, I just recently switched to the Steam version)
8561	1	a	alot like fallout. all in all a great game
6221	0	a	Boring and mediocre.
8563	1	a	While it takes a while to getting used to, it's a hell of a lot of fun!:D
8565	1	a	i absoulutly love this game. First time i have ever found a game with great deatail and lil to no lag .
8567	1	a	For a f2p mmo such as this, the gameplay is quite enjoyable. Though the story takes a small while to warm up, after players get to know the UI to a reasonable level the game becomes slightly addictive. Cooperative class building, equipment crafting and missions make for an enjoyable experience as you and your friends explore new environments.   The only issue I had is late game when pvp gets involved. The terrirotrial resource war pvp becomes very demanding on computer performance. Though not a game breaking issue, folks without gaming towers will just have to stick with pve (which isn't really a bad thing).
8569	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
8571	1	a	Amazing Roleplaying game with a TON of action, combat, and crafting involved. It's like minecraft meets skyrim then gets in a nuclear war.
8573	1	a	the game is good i had a character who was one of the leaders of a notorious gang we rekt at pvp , i love the sniping action the game might look crap but the feeling is wow
8575	1	a	FANTASTIC game!! GREAT graphics and gameplay!!! Whether you want to craft, farm and harvest, or blast your way through endless mutants, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! Vehicles, weapons and armor, camps and farms...you name it, you can craft it!! The storyline is good, and just the gameplay itself is worth it!!! I would recommend this game to anyone...you wont be disappointed!!!!
8577	1	a	Not a bad game by any means. It's fun, enjoyable, does get repetitive at times..but you spend no money on it out of the box, and there is no box.  Thing is, you can only craft one item at a time, before having to buy at least one thing, to get more slots. Can suck, as that's 'one item', not 'one stack of items'..
8579	1	a	Fun when u know how to do it .. :))))
6222	0	a	Very freaking bad video card wise and ill tell you how it completely crashed my PC that's how!!!
8581	1	a	Kind of buggy. Price is right (free to play) took a little time to install. Played worse free games. Game should be happy i recommend it. just because i feel like it... lol
8583	1	a	this game is amazing it is really fun to play with friends or solo.The map is big so you wont get bored of your suroundings and there are always missions to do .The combat engine is realy good and it runs smoothly(even a laptop can run it)i would highly recommend this awesome game:D
8585	1	a	 Scratches the Post-Apocalyptic Itch
8587	1	a	My favorite part is when the starting sequence is completely invisible to me.
6227	0	a	Horrible game. The interface is clumsy and unintuative, even with customization. The graphics are sub-par, and hardly anything in the game can be interacted with, even though there are what appear to be useful items strewn about. Don't waste your time with this one.
8589	1	a	If you want a Fallout like MMORPG then this is your game.
8591	1	a	I'd recommend this game to anyone its got a great concept for a mmo that you just don't see in most post-apocalyptic survival games.
8593	1	a	Not a bad game, it is free to play so of course the better items cost money to buy. Just like the turbine games such as Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons. Other than that fault, the game is just about like any other MMO. This one has a Fallout taste to it being set in a post apocalypse world. The main down side is the crafting can take a lot of time to do unless you pay to remove the limit.
6230	0	a	Ok sooooo, I installed went to play and it asks you to create an account. No problem lets do that. Wait, it is saying I already have  1......what?  I have never played this so how do I......ok let me attempt guessing it. Nope, not happening, so I try doing a password reset. IT WORKED, maybe now I can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing play this game already. But wait.....what is my username associated to that password? I try everything I could think of, Steam name, E-mail and random usernames I usually use. Nope, nothing, nada, zip, zilch. I give up â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME, UNINSTALLED. You know you have wasted your time installing when the game doesn't even want you to play it.
8595	1	a	Fallen Earth could be better but it's still not a bad MMO to play to get away from more mainstream MMO's.
8597	1	a	This game has very good gameplay mechanics and does a very well job in defining a post-apocalyptic feel :)) definitely recommend this game.
8599	1	a	Kind of boring to be honest. It's alright though, feels like Fallout online. If you like fallout and mmo's then you shoudl try it out.
6231	0	a	i would have to pay someone to play this game 0/21 not worth it being free i tried to play this game but it was confusing and the graphics were terrible like terrible
6232	0	a	you should probably make sure your game doesnt lag to hell when you look at an entity... especially when a large bulk of the game is combat oriented. im not wipinng myself with this game unless they fix the lag issue. its bad enough that they make the player wait for a dogs age waiting for updates and a million agreements. if the lag wasnt a problem however it would be pretty good.
6233	0	a	you can not log in
8601	1	a	This MMO is, well almost identical to others like most are. And honestly i don't mind. I like these kinds of games more than enough to play them, especially if they're set in a universe or atmosphere that I am enjoying (a great example being SWTOR or KOTOR because I am a huge Star Wars fan). But one thing i like about this, and this is similar to Destiny (which i also loved), is how it combines your tipical MMO with a first and third person shooter stile, more tradisional in big AAA games like Call of Duty, Battlefiel, etc. This means as well as these MMO's were you running around leveling up and colectiong loot you also get the FPS experiance were you get to aim a gun at your foe and blast in to bits rather than pressing 1, waiting for your ability to charge and pressing 1 again, then waiting for your ability to charge and pressing 1 again, and so forth. And if you dont like that, if you prefere this method of spamming 1, then you probably wont like this game unless there is some way to change that (which i don't think there is). It is set in a large apocalyptic landscape were you can join and hunt factions, use scavanging and mining or brutaly murder NPC's to gain money, play competative pvp or i assume clan wars. Or you can go out and be a d*ck to other players, by killing them on sight just for the fun of it (I won't judge you... unless you kill ME). But i just love it when games combine elements of these two game types and i think it works really well. BUT i have not been playing for long and this review could RAPIDLY change from thumbs up, to thumbs down, as i play this games more, and learn this games back-to-front. Signing out.
6235	0	a	Everyone who has played this game and said it was good obviously doesn't know what Fallout is...
6236	0	a	The controls are really wierd to use e.g: q and e are the rotation buttons.This could have been a really cool game if it just had a better control scheme.  
8603	1	a	Awesome game! You should try it 
8605	1	a	Free to Play version (no limitations, you're only faster leveling up if you're premium) of Fallout.
6237	0	a	so i download this game and it says i need to set up an account so i type my email bla bla bla and then i validate it all and it says i need to install it and i click install and it gets flagged for containing a virus, i wouldnt waste any time trying to install it tbh
8607	1	a	Starts off kind of boring but gets fun in the mid game
8609	1	a	Very well made, alot of freedom and... well it's just done right. It's basically Fallout 3 online but a bit different, not in a bad way though. Also it's now recently become free to play so there is no harm in trying it! What do you have to loose =D
6238	0	a	While a noble concept and interesting lore this falls incredibly short due to clunky controls and mechanics. Luckily this was free otherwise I'd be pulling my hair out now....
8611	1	a	The title has nothing to do with the earth falling through space.  10/10
6239	0	a	I started to download the game when I went to bed and it made my HD make alot of noise and kept waking me up. Then DocTarr said it was crap. So I erased it.
8613	1	a	Best MMO of 2015 10/10 would play again
6240	0	a	All the makings of a great game in a not great game!  Oh well, at least I didn't pay for it.
8615	1	a	(:
8617	1	a	good, deep, and long playing game u cant get boring !!!!!!!!
8619	1	a	Lot of fun.. Nice game.
8621	1	a	fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things
8623	1	a	It's pretty good both gameplay wise and story wise. It only gets better with friends and even better the farther you get, and as you explore the world of Fallen Earth.
8625	1	a	i recommend it. 1.) free. 2.) its fun and interesting. 3.) it gives you a fallout feel that will also get rid of all your fallout withdrawels. ok. so seriously. not pay to win/play/or even look. its free. feels wierd in a way but it also plays smoothly for jus about any pc. i personaly like this game. it reminds me of fallout 3 with a touch.
6250	0	a	Post apocaliptic??? Survival game??? WTF, It feels like an mmo, not a survival game. 10/10 ign
6251	0	a	This is the worst MMORPG I have ever played in my entire life. This game is so bad that when I played the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing floor and wall textures didn't load, ON THE TUTORIAL. This game laughs at players with TERRIBLE graphics, HORRIBLE AI, and render distance that makes Atari look like Half Life 2 in HD. The only thing good about this turd of a game is that you can uninstall it. I would rather chop off my testicles and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, than play this game again.  -100/10
6252	0	a	/,.
6253	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS...I CANNOT LOG IN!!  THEN IM SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS
8627	1	a	This is one of those mission type/salvaging MMO's. I really enjoy this one. If you donâ€™t have this game, get it. Though if you have a normal computer, I would recommend you change the game graphic settings to their absolute lowest. If you do that, should be fine, otherwise you will rage quit from lagging to the point where you die from it. Because it is a 100% online game (no single player mode), most of the high end graphics is not needed.  Over all I really like this game. The lay out is great, I can play for hours at a time, and there are hundreds of achievements to try and unlock.  (8.9 out of 10)
8629	1	a	epic fallout like mmo
8631	1	a	Good game, kinda like fallout, i can see myself getting into it.
8633	1	a	Really good game its just like fallout only set online
8635	1	a	Much improved bugwise in recent times. Truly f2p, but you will benefit from subscribing (crafting wise.) Lot to be said PvP wise here, but PvE is more meh. Fun cash shop, but a bit overpriced. Fun to just solo and fart around which is rare in MMOs. If you like crafting this is your Huckleberry.
8637	1	a	this game is cool 
8639	1	a	This game... Well simply I picked it up on a whim and got addicted to the crafting system, the first crafting system to actually make sense. Besides that being a shooter mmo it is not like most mmo's where its press tab and sit back; no on the contrary you better aim your gun or weapon carefully.
6259	0	a	I really liked the game at first, but it kept going downhill, the last thing I will say is the G.O.R.E. update, it released new weapons, a rifle, pistol and sword. Each one of those weapons were able to be upgraded 2 times, so it'd be rifle, upgraded rifle, upgraded upgraded rifle, but of course, each upgrade was harder to do, and the most upgraded rifle, could easily one hit kill someone, the DPS on the pistols (which shot in three burst (now fixed)) was insanely high, and well, for the sword, all melee is over powered so you get the idea on that. Some people made a clan to nerf the guns, some people made a clan to get rid of the update and killed anyone (the clan was always in a zerg) using the weapons, whether they were in the same faction or not. And then there was a clan that said to keep the update as is, and of course, they were using the Level 3 weapons. So they finally nerfed the weapons after about a month or so. Some people are wondering things like 'Why is he even saying this?' Well, I'm saying this because if the Devs released an update that had insanely OP weapons without even thinking about if it's OP, or to test it or anything really, It really makes me not being able to trust them with future content, and also, the only reason the nerfed it, is because people were canceling their subscriptions until they nerfed it 
8641	1	a	So far It's quite very nice. Had fun playing it
8643	1	a	You can play that... in 2005 :D Nice game thou :)
6261	0	a	Didn't enjoy the game that much. I think the dev's don't put enough attention on the newer players and focus on keeping their older player base.
8645	1	a	My Game is Stuck on Collating Data doesnt want to go past 3% . Anyone help me out with the problem?
8647	1	a	This is as badass as it gets. Think of it as Fallout: New Vegas: The MMO, except that you get horses, ATVS, motorcycles, choppers, dune buggies, cars and even a mutant wolf to ride, every gun being craftable and rewarded via PvP and quests, major focus in world pvp aswell as competitive PvP arenas, and oh so much more. I have never seen such a fun to work with, and easy to use crafting system in any other MMO. It is easy to grab the materials you need, level it up, and build the next gun, sword, motorcycle, or armor with. This game will keep you entertained FOREVER. There are no seperate servers, but rather just one big one, so you will always have players at your side and truly have that 'MMO' feel all while not fighting over drops that NPCs give and the such. This is also one of few games that traveling far distances is actually enjoyable in. This game is absolutely HUGE and literally takes hours and hours to cross an entire region. I wish I could write more, but this is just gold.
6263	0	a	its so bad dont download 
8649	1	a	A decent post-apocalyptic MMO with a deep crafting system and a lot of content. Not really pay-to-win either. Definitely worth a try if the genre appeals to you or you want an MMO with something a little different to offer.
6264	0	a	Well i cant login ive made an account tried loging in with steam still wouldent work so id love to play the game looks fun but i cant even get in so this sucks!
6265	0	a	game is dead wont even let you sign up to play it
8651	1	a	If you're still sad about the fallout MMO being canceled, this game serves as a good substitute for it.
8653	1	a	i can't login,so i can't get on to atually play someone please help. t
8655	1	a	Hello, Now i dont really play to many MMOs but from learning and knowing alot about them i have some knowledge on them. This game is one of the best games ive played in a while. And yes i only have 5 hours into this game but so far it is a great game.   Weapons-There are a huge amount of weapons in fallen earth, weather its melee weapons like spiked bats or swords to guns like sniper rifles pistols and a bunch of other weapons.  Armor-There are a bunch of cloths and armor that you can get in the game which help protect yourself  Crafting-This is one of the big ones. There is alot of things to craft weather its crating ammo , weapons ,Armor , food , and a bunch of other things.  enemys-There are bunch of monsters and people that you will come across and kill. Theres bosses and alot of hard things to fight, but when you have the right gear and weapons some enemys will become easy to kill but there are alot of hard enemys that ly ahead.  Map-The map is giant! its broken up into sectors with different areas and biomes and you can come a across many things while you roam the land.  Friends-I like to play with friends this game is very fun with a group of friends and take out bosses , fortresses , etc...  PVP-Now i havent done or encountered this. but There are pvp areas all around the map huge areas to where you can kill other players build bases together raid peoples bases and have epic battles.  This is by far one of the best games ive ever played i give this 10/10  Hope to see you in the atomic wasteland! :)
8657	1	a	I like this game, it's very easy to play.
6267	0	a	I decided to play this game in the good faith of APB's Succes (IMO) And to even put this game under the name of GamersFirst Is a big mistake! I thought this would be THE Fallout online thing, boy oh boy was I wrong xD... You start off as a dude underground, some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ happens, you die and Wake up again, being told that you're a clone, You go out of the chosen bunker and die to everything because the only thing you got is a freaking paintball gun.... Jesus  Alas I played it for about 30 hours before steam and let me just tell you right now Nothing is gonna happen I wandered for so long collecting ressourses only to find out I needed half a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on more of something to craft anything And when I finally got those damn things it took me about 3 hours to craft.... this game, brings depression!
6268	0	a	A BIG SHET I CAN GO OUT OF THE START AND MAKE ANYTING 
6269	0	a	The only thing that matters in a game is 'is it fun to play' ans the simple anwser is no; I cannot recomend a game that is as dull as this. The concept is great, the execution is not.
8659	1	a	yes this game is old yes this game is buggy and does not have the best combat but this is not a simple game , its actually very challenging and rewarding game crafting is owesome and unlike any other game i have found.  There are no classes you make your own and have fun with it, leveling is slow but fun because you get to enjoy a lot of content tthe game map is massive and filled with dungeons and cool places to explore i played mmos for more than 10 years and never had anything come close to a game that is as unique as this one ,   Try this game have some patience learn how to play it and dont listen to those guys who just loged in and didnt understand anything , you cant learn to play a game in 10 minutes   also ifyou have at least a 1MB download speed the games takes 2 hour max to download ,the guys who took days must have a bad bandwidth
6271	0	a	This game turned out to be bad now...
8661	1	a	Basically fallout for poor people
6272	0	a	too much of a hastle to get a account and i have tried everything so ya they need to simplify it.
6273	0	a	i started the game up about... 2 years(?) ago and it automatically set to 800x600 resolution on my 16:10 monitor. Also craftable horses and clunky UI. graphics are a bit... 1990s. lighting makes the game look blurry.
8663	1	a	The beginning verification and updates were long and so freakin' annoying,but the game is good.
8665	1	a	After hundreds of hours invested in this game I can say it's fun, but there are enough flaws to drive away the majority of players. The development of this game stalled after about two years, leaving a playable but unsatisfying experience overall. There are several zones to explore in this game, each offering many different types of missions and rewards. The final zone is a half finished area only accessible by players who have reached the level cap.  Over the years content has been added, including pvp and pve content, allowing players to enjoy hundreds of hours of entertainment. Some of the fixes and additions frustrated some of the more experieenced players and made it nearly impossible for new players to realy enjoy anything beyond the first parts of the game.  Leveling is slow going without help from experienced players. With the right help it's possible to reach the level cap in two days or less. Reaching the skill point cap is a different matter. Plyers will need to dedicate at least a hundred hours to optional races that award points that will improve their character's 'build'. It's important to choose the right build and figure out how to exploit the various skill sets. WIth the right skill set players are able to dominate pvp matches and earn death toll. These pvp points can be spent on power-ups and gear that can't be purhcased or crafted. Some of the pvp gear can be purchased through the auction house for a considerable sum.  Making money is pretty easy with the right recipes. Selling items such as ammo and fuel at the auction house makes it possible to eran money farely quickly, but the best money comes from selling serendipity items and boss loot. Although the best gear and weapons come from earning death toll, the next best thing is crafted with rare and unique items found in the later zones.  I definitely recommend this game for someone looking for a open-world rpg. Although the game is free to play it isn't pay to win. Premium membership does have it's perks though. WIth a minimal premium purchase players can reach the level cap in a few hours, but most premium items are purely cosmetic. Respec injectors are overpriced, so I recommend using guides to make an ideal build from the start. RPG players that enjoy fps games will have may ours of enjoyment even if the graphics are pretty dated.
6274	0	a	Having trouble linking it to Steam and I've reset my Steam password three times (which, with Authenticator every single time is a huge pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥). I've wasted two hours and a support ticket (with no response from the manufacturer).  0/5 stars. Even looking on thier gamersfirst.[com] forums, it seems like this has been a recurring problem since 2011.  Frankly, I'm so angry at a wasted evening at this point that I could spit.  I'd appreciate any advice.
6275	0	a	wont even show the launcher, looks good but wont work...
8667	1	a	well let me start out with saying...  when i first tried to login it didn't work so yeah i used 2 hours to try and fix it.  then i went to the loading screen it took FOREVER. and the graphics looks like it was made in 2007 but the gameplay worked fine so i would say... 5/10 
8669	1	a	Yes Its its a ummmmmm ya get it
6277	0	a	great for about 12 hours of gameplay. after that even dropping money on it doesnt make it better.
8671	1	a	I like the post-apoctliptic style
8673	1	a	good and free many crafting items
8675	1	a	epic game with huge open world worth playing
6278	0	a	Looking at this, I was expecting a Fallout-ish experience. I was mistaken, but not by much. Don't let the play time fool you, I played a good 50 hours of this outside of Steam. Pros: -Crafting -Exploration -Factions -Multiple starts -Many weapons -Steampunk feel -Reminiscent of New Vegas without being a clone -Very open  Cons: -Glitchy -Crafting system is a bit confusing -PvP is populated almost entirely by hackers -Optimizatin is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ -Players are generally ill-tempered -AI isn't verry Intelligent -Quests can be a handful at times -Aiming likes to twitch, making long-range shots hard -Leveling system is a pain  Neutral: -Tutorial can be a bit confusing on your first run through -Graphics are a bit dated -Kinda empty (Not sure if they're going for the 'Wasteland' feel)  Overall, it's fun to play with friends for a week or two, but not something I'd sink another 50 hours into
6279	0	a	The game felt old for 2011, let alone 2015, don't bother.
8677	1	a	Its a really awesome underated game..wish more people enjoyed it :l
8679	1	a	Scratches that fallout itch for post apocalypse good overall free to play. 7/10
8681	1	a	Saw this downloadable on Steam, was thinking about giving it a second chance...Played for several years, took a break. This game, like many others, comes close, but falls short of the Ultimate MMORPG(FPS).  Pros:  Detailed crafting system. Excellent Foraging/Salvaging System. Gain levels from crafting. Crafting actually takes longer (for a realistic effect), ie. you can't craft a car in 2 minutes, it takes awhile... Gameplay is fun, it's nice to have a MMOFPS that actually counts headshots. Graphics are decent. You actually have to aim (for most skills/attacks). Pretty Realistic in some aspects.   Cons: The character animations are super clunky and akward. Small playerbase. The mutations (think of it as magic in other games) are pretty limited, ie. no 'caster' class in the game.   That's about all I can think of for now. Overall, it's a good game, if you haven't tried it, its atleast worth a try!
8683	1	a	I played this game in Beta, and it has come so far since then. Great graphics, target orriented combat, thousands of missions, best crafting system Ive seen in a game (you can be all proffesions) and random bonuses. Everyone is on one server. I subscribed, but there is no need to, f2p offers a ton in itself.
6283	0	a	bad bad bad bad bad bad  Fallout meets a steaming pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8685	1	a	Looks fun starting off, will see how the rest plays out.
6286	0	a	Well, wasn't that an utter waste of 8gig of data!!!
8687	1	a	Closest thing to Fallout Online there is. Unfortunately, not a whole lot of players. Definetely try this out though.
8689	1	a	Game is addictive, and community is excelent!
8691	1	a	Love this game, it absorbed me, I got lost in it for over 800 hours. Unfortunately though, I couldn't adjust to the PvP.  There were the regular PvPers that I could generally take in a fight, but then there were elites.... and a large portion of the games best late game content is in PvP zones which was both my favorite part and my least favorite. But if you're up for a challenging PvP late game, and an immersive dark wasteland environment with good stories and a well thought out crafting and market system, then this is a good game for you. :)
8693	1	a	awsome game i love gomes that your free too explore the world and the quests are nice i dont see anything bad with this game other then the garphics i mean they are good but ive seen better but still an amzing very nice and fun game to play
6288	0	a	There's a bug that I don't know how to fix: Every time I start the game, all I see is gray, a few textures here and there but pretty much nothing. the textures show up for about a second right when I start the game. Can anybody help?
8695	1	a	Fallen Earth.  One of my favorite mmorpg's out there.  One of the better things is does is it's crafting system.  Everything you own,you can craft. Of course you can still buy it, but it is still pretty awesome.   The gameplay is somewhat okay, it feels like a normal mmorpg in the gameplay.  The world is HUGE, compared to other free2play mmorpg's i have played in a while.  There are no real class, so you can create your own playstyle from a good bunch of skills and traits.    Now i know alot of people say this is a 'Fallout Clone/copy'. Which is far from it, the game is nothing  like Fallout except that you can both have first and third person. And that it is a rpg in a apocalypse world.  So my advice is to try it out before you judge it, because hey it's free2play.
8697	1	a	Buggy as hell, AI is utterly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, don't expect any patches. Only real reason to play this game is for its uniqueness: An MMORPG with Third-person shooter mechanics, and a decent salvage based crafting system.
6291	0	a	It's an ok game but it gets boring and repetitive quite quickly :/
8699	1	a	Got killed by a crab that had a computer monitor as its shell.   10/10
6292	0	a	This game is not good after the level capped you dont have nothing to do (no Pvp's no raid's)
8701	1	a	This Game is AWESOME
8703	1	a	Ok so, where do I start? This game was a game I was very fond of (As my time spent playing it might show) and I've already written a review before but since it was kinda choppy I stepped upon it again and decided to add to it.  I've been playing this game for around 4 years back when I started around 2012 when I was also first introduced to steam, so along with downloading TF2 this game caught my eye as my love of post-apoc settings for games sparked my intrigue. Back then, this game just had so much to offer, to me in particular as I was fine with discovering most of it for myself with managing to obtain an ATV early on.   In terms of gameplay, the whole grinding aspect didn't really bother much as I was still managing to have fun cooperating with various people I would meet around placed like Embry (I think that was the name of the main S1 city?) and City where there was an event to protect a town made up by players from enemy mobs (Called Shivas If I'm correct) where you would see people showing off their cool gear and mounts.  The PvP aspect of the game was never really anything I tapped into, It just didnt really intrest me, but I'm sure theres some players out their who saw its potential.  To end this review of, no matter how bad it is, I guess this game is kinda dead with its peak being off in the earlier years where I made a few friends on my way to Lvl 55.  If anyone remembers me, my main characters name was Brad Carson, with other names like Pvt.Brad being another char of my mine, and to anyone who remembered me, It was a pleasure having played a fun game with you for quite a few years.   Sorry if this review was pretty bad, I'm just really getting over a lot.
8705	1	a	I &lt;3 you G1. And this game is rather monotonous. Still nice though. Instead of sleeping pills or such. Works.
6293	0	a	Wasting time simulator ;D
8707	1	a	Fun, little funny. But you know, its an everyday thing to get ate by a mutant chicken right?
8709	1	a	Rich in content and F2P, no real pay wall that I've noticed.  One of the best MMOs for weak hardware, runs great on my super old laptop AMD A6-4400 APU, which is weaker than an intel integrated laptop gpu from 2013.  The grind is there but not too excessive.  You get a horse early on and other useful equipment like guns.   Easy-ish to learn. Can be confusing at first or if you haven't played in a very long time.  Great looking environments.  Can not be beat for free price tag, i'd say even at $20 it would be a great bergain. I'm not sure why people don't recommend this game more. I've always had fun in my short time with it.
8711	1	a	Stumbled on this game and decided to try it out. It's a fairly outdated graphics system, understandably as it's an older game, but it's still very much intriguing from the start, if you can get past the graphics (some people demand more with our current tech these days, and nothing wrong with that.) Anyhow, the style of gameplay is fun and keeps you busy, while the maxed out players online I've often found to be quite helpful. The downfall to the community thing, is that there's hardly one left from what I've seen. I'm cool with that though. I have fun solo or with the occasional team mates. It's open world and fully explorable, with all kinds of weapon/armor upgrades and crafting involved. Basically like a dumbed down red dead redemption meets morrowind meets MMO. It's cool, worth the download, especially since it's f2p. 8/10
6294	0	a	Patch installer stops at 69 % so i can't install the whole game!  10/10 would patch again.
8713	1	a	  good game easy to level up and overall no big problems.
8715	1	a	Amazing game, If you liked Fallout and/or Stalker, then this is the game for you.
8717	1	a	Free 2 Play and not a Pay 2 Win! The 'buy now' sticker can be moved off the screen by the way.  But yeah though, I had my fun with this game, it was actually pretty great up untill you start getting into Territory Control (TC) where the map is constantly ruled by the Travelers because nothing beats Dual Pistols simply because every disadvantage a pistol is supposed to have, simply doesn't exsist oh sure they argue 'Duh huh huh ammos expansive tho'  Not when you have 40+ Chip harvesters pumping out a constant line of red chips for you. Play the game but dont get into the PVP unless you want to use dual pistols.
8719	1	a	Nice MMORPG :) IF you like Fallout you will like this.
8721	1	a	HELL YEAH!! It's a very awesome combination of MM and FPS, the big world is amazing, the way every looks and feels around you is amazing!
8723	1	a	played this game for years now the devs never give new content or fix old bugs pure lazy dev team but for a frre to play game its one of best out there just dont hit max level to fast or bordom will follow
6297	0	a	The game's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8725	1	a	Great game! EXCELLENT for role play and has the largest role play community Ive seen in ANY game. It's a huge open sandbox with endless quests and the most wonderful crafting system Ive ever experienced. Only issue maybe is end game play. There are no 'dungeon like' instances such as WoW has. Once you max lvl and max your crafting all thats really left is role play. I guess thats fine for role players lol! Anyway, its well worth playing. The only difference between P2P and F2P is crafting/harvesting/gathering speed but thats a pretty big difference considering how important crafting is in the game.
6299	0	a	This game was a good idea, but is one of the worst games I have ever played in my life!!! I had more fun playing E.T.
8727	1	a	I like the game just takes a long time to level up...
6301	0	a	do not download this game!!! it is pure crap and i would advise staying away from it like it could give you aids or something!!!
8729	1	a	Bigest Crap ever! Don't waste your Time.
8731	1	a	this game is fun... go get the game... no seriously just download it i mean its free... its fun.
8733	1	a	Great game. Fair for F2P Graphics - meh  
8735	1	a	This game was fun but far too slow for me to really get into a lot I gave it a bit of time but the progression was just way too slow for me I felt as if I was playing WoW and the tutorial system was just as bad as WoW's when I tried this game though even with that all being said the game looked great and it showed a lot of promise.   While this type of game isnt for some people myself included I would still recommend it just for the fact that the game itself doesnt feel lieks ome kind of horrible ten minute made on a low budget game. The quality of this game is amazing and the simple fact that its free makes it all that much better I don't understand why so many people have a mixed view of this game but I am sure its in part to the fact that the community wasnt very nice to new players.
8737	1	a	Fallen earth is a exremelly good tps/fps game that is sort of post-apocalptic (excuse bad spelling). i dont really know/remember the main objetive. but you are a clone that is needing to change part of this world due to an apocalypse.
8739	1	a	there are zombies and the game is first person and third person u also start with some wepons like a sniper and axe download it
8741	1	a	p2p days will be forever missed..
8743	1	a	This game is so much fun I played it for 8 hours with out stopping.
8745	1	a	I first played this game back in 2012. I Really liked that you can do whatever you want. Do quests, grind and loot all day, craft new stuff, or just have fun in PvP. Fallen Earth reminds you of Fallout 3 and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alot, so if you're into any of those games you will most likely enjoy playing Fallen Earth.   The game sadly turned more and more into a Pay 2 Win game after the 2.4 patch. However, you can still enjoy most features without doing any payments, yet it takes longer time for you.  The community is very friendly and extremely helpful if you've got some questions.
8747	1	a	Good game features, great mmo, monsterious customization and crafting system.  Lacks a more fluid combat system.
8749	1	a	look i played this game for the 1rst time and i hated it.but then i realised that i was being an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and treating this game like our modern f2p shooters.But once i started 2 play it and treat it like how its supposed 2 be pllayed it was awesome !!!!!!
8751	1	a	great game
8753	1	a	Fallen Earth was OK.Not one of the best games I played,but not terrible.There are many errors to it,and in the beggining the gameplay is a little dull,but overall its a decent game mostly for fans of fallout 3.
8755	1	a	I really like this game xD
8757	1	a	Great game love the way the item system works as well
8759	1	a	Good game, kinda like fallout, i can see myself getting into it.
6308	0	a	This game needs a lot of work before it can become even close to being good.
6309	0	a	Probably the worst Post Apocalyptic Survival i have played. So much lag, graphics are completely terrible, i noticed a lot of hacking as well along with overpowered enemies and you have to put tons of money into the game to be able to get anything good. As of all the game is not worth it, it is a waste of time and space.  2/10 i would say to be honest, The game has achieved to be on steam and has gotten many players to play it. But everything is off on it completely. And also to add the website is off 80% of the time and so is the main server. (I have played for a whole day\24 hours and it still sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥...)
8761	1	a	A really fun post-apocolyptic mmorpg that involves quite the amount of mechanics, however this game is not very fun solo, well neither is any mmo. I would recommend this f2p mmo for just how fun it is in the first place even in solo, I would of course enjoy to have more friends play the game and making it easier to find them (you'll be surprised how hard it is to find your friend). I also enjoy the fact that it has a night and day cycle, but too many microtransactions (of course) makes the gameplay less apealing to those who doesn't want to 'waste' money on a f2p game, but at the end of the day, it still remains to be a fun game to play.
8763	1	a	This is a really god post apoctalyptic MMO.Its often fun and interesting especialy if your playing with some friends.Its like a mashup of fallout 3,minecraft and an MMO.Its a fun game and i would give it a 9 out of 10 and i recommend it.
8765	1	a	my first game, it was fun than got old
8767	1	a	If you keep in mind that it's f2p you'l be stunned by the enviroment and all the little things that make this game worth it!
8769	1	a	I guess if I had to make it short and sweet it's like Fallout but with a much larger focus on crafting and multiplayer, so I suppose if you enjoy fallout you'll enjoy this
8771	1	a	fun and addicting but the atv should go faster
6311	0	a	The pictures posted are a complete lie the games so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up u require a seizure to understand whats going on and if thats not enough as i finished punching my face the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wouldnt delete properly so now i feel like ive picked up what was suposed to be a good time and been left with AIDS thanks alot
6312	0	a	Was not fond of it 30 seconds in. Did not even give it a chance, looked like poor mans fallout. HUD way too cluttered right at the start.
8773	1	a	Really Interesting Game, If You And Your Friends Like Kinda Sorta End Of The World Stuff Then You Will Like This Game. Although It Cannot Fully Capture The, 'End Of The World' Feel, Being An MMO And All.
8775	1	a	this game looks fun i think i might do a youtube video on this game
6313	0	a	Bad: The controls are super weird and annoying until you change them, The graphics aren't the best but thats fine, looting is annoying, I also dont understand why we need to see all our skills at the bottom when we can just hit Y (default enteract button) to activate the thing, and you really need to pay attention in the start or else you won't under stand a thing which I really hate  Good: The story isn't bad, everyone is preaty nice, dosn't lag like crazy, and its free.
8777	1	a	THIS GAME IS THE BOMB! I love it soo much. It's a hardcore MMORPG! Its a good RPG because it takes along time to beat it. Ive been playing for a month and im only a level 8. Might seem like it sucks, but it doesnt. Its not like COD or fallout where you pick your stats when you level up. You earn AP for doing stuff. AP can be used to select your stats if you just have leveled up, or when ever! Also the game has alot of missions. It keeps you strapped to your seat. I love the crafting system. Its just so cool and keeps you looking for bits and doodads. You can also get cars, atv, dune buggies, and horses. You can get pets also! So far I have a Axe, Golfclub, air rifle, dual .357 magnums, dual crude shivs, and dual metal plumbing pipes. Those are my weapons. I also have a old nag as a horse. 1/10 scale i would rate it 9/10. Has good everything except that it takes forever to get a veichle. Also the servers can lag and some missions aren't playable unless you restart. I RECOMMEND THIS!!!!
8779	1	a	Not the best mmo on the net, but a great opportunity for apocaliptic-lovers.
8781	1	a	Really good game its just like fallout only set online
8783	1	a	This game is awesome you get skills like in maplestory and you get to make your own guns and armor and vechiles 
6317	0	a	WORST GAME EVER!! It's a piece of crap and poorly deisnged. It probably gets funner at higher levels but it takes forever to get there. it's a waste of space on a computer.
8785	1	a	its a fun unique game if ur looking for something with first and third person and killing enemies and a kind of a free world sandbox and with quests and horses i really enjoyed it :)
8787	1	a	One of the best MMORPGs I have ever played! A real big game of PvP, so gear and kill players!
8789	1	a	yess i like it a little bit but how do u go into 3rd person? 
8791	1	a	For the short time I've been in game it didn't seem too bad, the other 7 hours were spent trying to load in or update.   
8793	1	a	this is a good action and aventure game for people who like killing stealing and dieing
8795	1	a	Its awesome, It has a sense of realism, and best of all, Its FREE.
8797	1	a	A Cool F2P Apocalypse game!
8799	1	a	the 3 day install my favorite part
8801	1	a	This game, despite its few bugs that dont 'bug'me very much at all (haha) is one of the best mmorpgfps's ive ever played.  Its emmersive its competetive you dont need to purchase things with reall money to have fun (just to show off) the character development is greatly in depth with the things that effect others the amount of things to learn is somewere in the millions theres something new to discover every day it can be played almost endlessly for years (ask the very first players that are STILL playing)  the list goes on.  I strongly recomend this game to anyone who likes open world, in depth, post apocalyptic, competitive, play forever mmorpgfps that is free to play.  Well done developers  P.S.- all you naggers out there who down the game for its tiny little bugs need to focus on the good things more, not the bad things.  Your's Truly, Tajaloe
8803	1	a	A lot to do for a new player. Very much like an online, not-so-gore-filled version of Fallout. As a F2P it is expected to be a heavy grinder or Pay for Premium deal. Where you can grind and spend more time to craft, level up abilities, and travel from place to place in game as opposed to a Premium member, but it makes up for it in pure in-game content and a fun post-apocalyptice free-to-play MMO-RPG. Bored often? Create a Fallen Earth account.
8805	1	a	Great Game! Lots of story, gameplay, and awesome players who will help you out along the way! I wish there were a few more options to reduce lag though.
8807	1	a	Seems like a good game, controls are a bit complicated or you can say different. But great amount of customization and huge map with a fair amount of playerbase. I would recommend this for people who don't really play alot of shooters and can easily accept the controls and complexness of the game.
8809	1	a	Its a very good game but very laggy on my low spec pc!
8811	1	a	The best mission-threads of any MMO I've ever played. Post-Nuke Bliss! ...but eventually PVP is going to rear its head, so be forewarned, if that's not 'your cup of meat'. I give it 8 out of 10, and no one gets a 10
8813	1	a	.
8815	1	a	This game as a single-player experience is rather bland and pointless, however, the exploration factor is cool.   PRO TIP: Play this game with friends. Call them on the phone and play it together from the start. The character build is pretty cool, but beware the fact that you can't change your character, so try not to have the same characters as each other.   Clans are completely pointless. Unless you have a friend-base of 10 people to make a clan with, there's no point.   Missions aren't so bad, but cooperative exploration is amazing in my opinion.  Other than that, it's not a bad game. I wish there were more games like this though
8817	1	a	Amazing Roleplaying game with a TON of action, combat, and crafting involved. It's like minecraft meets skyrim then gets in a nuclear war.
8819	1	a	Downloaded.... few minutes later. Yay! about to play the game , woops new updated, downloaded... downloaded... downloaded... meh uninstalled.  WASTE YOUR TIME SIMULATOR 2015 10/10
8821	1	a	this is a great roleplaying game about america after ww3 and i love this game so i recomend it for EVERYONE
8823	1	a	Its a great game if you have the time to play. It gets really in depth with crafting and all types of weapons and skills to find I might have to reinstall it again
6326	0	a	Boring and mediocre.
8825	1	a	While it takes a while to getting used to, it's a hell of a lot of fun!:D
8827	1	a	i absoulutly love this game. First time i have ever found a game with great deatail and lil to no lag .
8829	1	a	This game offers lots to do for mmo gamers at every level. The maps are large and look the part. Enemies vary to keep things interesting and generally fit in their environment on the map. Crafting is a HUGE part of this game and can be time consuming but it is done in a way that players can queue up tasks for offline time. Character can be built with skills chosen by the player and customized to fit playstyle. Quests are available in the game but are optional.  Personally the crafting element of the game is my favorite. It brings together the need to scavenge and find the parts you need to craft to advane further into the game.  If you enjoy a sandbox mmo that doesn't marshal you through it's world from start to finish and you enjoy the genre, I would recommend trying this game.  (This review is based off playtime from before the game was offered on Steam, I just recently switched to the Steam version)
8831	1	a	the games sucks u need to make an acount because it doesnt use ur steam acount also when u make an acount it desnt even let u pres create new acount ITS SO STUPID
8833	1	a	WHY IT FREEZZZEEEZ FOR MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE if I enter to a romm in the tutorial?
8835	1	a	alot of fun in both freemium and premium modes. Freebies are limited in crafting ques and exp. Freemiums get crafting skill que unlocked and around 100% exp, There are 3 premiums and the cheapest is survovor for $10 and is well worth it IMHO ;)  One of the few games in a post apocaplypse setting that have detailed char creation right down to tattoos and makeup, good and fun gameplay for both free and premium players. Also level cap is 55 regardless of your free or paid you are not limited like most mmo's to a lower level cap.   Crafting is fun and you can craft yourself a awesome set of gear that is better then anything you can buy unlike WOW or other mmo's where usually you will find better in quests then your crafting allows you to make...
8837	1	a	This game is a real good game for me a lest you idk.But you i think you should get it because its like fallout i seen some likes and downs but its a good game if i were you i would get this game i would give this game 9.5/10 its real good if you have friends and you want to play this game with them it gets a lot more fun with more friends get the game its REAL FUN.
8839	1	a	This game is actually so much fun. Yeah it's mostly a rip off of Fall out new vagas, but not everyone can afford games like fall out. This is a great FREE game that's loads of fun, but it does have some really stupid achievements.
6329	0	a	During my short time with Fallen Earth, I don't think there was a moment where I wasn't bored. One way of putting it is 'the game has a steep learning curve', but in reality that just means it has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ controls and convoluted mechanics elsewhere. Bad, even for an MMO.
8841	1	a	Insidiously addictive. The Wild Wild West meets the Apocalypse.
8843	1	a	So much fun from a well designed free to play game! Never thought they would be this good.
8845	1	a	dont play this it sucks
8847	1	a	Only have about 6 or so hours into this game but so far, I'm loving it. For the price, you can't get much better. In reading the other reviews before getting this game, I saw a lot of mention of this being the 'poor man's Fallout' game. Being a huge fan of the Fallout franchise, I find this to be mostly accurate, but it doesn't live up the the actual play of this game. It has a lot of what made the Fallout series great, and expands on what Fallout could have been, had it been made into a MMO. It also seems to be much more detailed when it comes to the scavenging and character building aspects. For what it is, I really couldn't ask for more. Once I get another 20 or 30 hours in, I will revisit this reveiw with a little more info and detail.
8849	1	a	This is definitly a niche game but if you like games that do not hand everything out to you and have a steep learning curve this game is for you. Barely any useful quest rewards, if you want something you have to go out farm for mats and craft the items yourself or pay someone else to do it. Beautiful graphics and fpslike gameplay seal the deal. Definitely not for everyone, but those who it is for it is a hidden gem.
8851	1	a	I'm not quite endgame yet, but I'm definitely far enough in to offer an informed opinion. I HIGHLY recommend Fallen Earth for the compelling stories (even the side quests are pretty captivating at times), advanced crafting, and outstanding player base. Since you've heard rants already, I'll clear up things I feel the other comments got wrong instead:  - This is a post-apocolyptic RPG, but beyond that it has little in common with Fallout. The crafting in Fallen Earth is much more advanced and takes longer (days, sometimes). The V.A.T.S. combat system we know and love from Fallout is not used. Most importantly, the actual story is completely different. So if you want F2P Online Fallout, you're going to miss the mark a little.  - It is nearly impossible to 'accidentally wander into' a PVP zone. You will be warned if you approach one and the map marks it with a glaring red zone. In the off chance you're blind enough to wander into one, players above that zone's max level are excruciatingly penalized for being there. So don't worry, you aren'y likely to be killed by another player until you're ready.  - Admittedly, the game is hard to get used to without a guide. There's no sugar-coating it. You know what they say about learning to ride a bicycle, though.  - Finally, while this is just my personal opinion, I think it's hard to consider crafting a hassle when you can literally keep playing while you craft. That engine your building will continue its construction while you shoot blight wolves and collect scraps.   Enough from me, download and try it. I certainly didn't regret doing so. 9/10
8853	1	a	Like a less fun version of fallout but its free!
8855	1	a	Hands down, one of my all time favorite game, and the only game that I ever addict to. Maybe it's because I started playing a week before summer start, but I still played 480 hours or 20 days in one summer... lol
6333	0	a	This game is complete garbage
8857	1	a	i personally love this game. i like the play style the level scystem and a bunch of other things. the only thing is that its hard to get chips in the game. im lvl 17 and all i have is 3 red chips. all in all its a good game. if anyone wants to team up or clan my name in game is Olfbert. also if yuo have an abuundance of chips that your doing nothing with would you send me some XD please. ill love you forever!
8859	1	a	The game is good, but it's nothing new. The downloads are a little lengthy but hey what mmo dosent have lengthy downloads/updates. I would reccomend it because it took me away from WoW for awhile.
6335	0	a	NAFF game, best to play Fallout 3, or something else, but not this, read other reviews for more indepth stuff.
8861	1	a	Have barely dented this game but so far it is pretty fun, contrary to other reviews the community is actual super friendly and helpful. Also contrary to other reviews Fallout fans will definitely enjoy this game, as long as you're not one of those close-minded gamers who compares every detail of a game to other triple A titles in the genre, yes it does give you a Fallout experience though it's not trying to be Fallout. It is it's own game. Kinda hard to get the hang of at first but if you are a vigilant gamer like myself you'll figure it out. Final note on that matter, there is a help channel in chat that you can ask anything on and every Vet and their mother that has figured the game out will give you better tips and advice than the wiki itself can. As far as mmorpgs go I'd give it an 8.5/10 mostly due to the unique immersive experience.
8863	1	a	Yes Its its a ummmmmm ya get it
6337	0	a	i think there are some other best games that you can play without feel that you are wasting your time. The graphics are a little poor. The game remmember me like 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of chernobyl' making reference to the 'point menu'.  It will be a better game if the graphics could be better
8865	1	a	This game is pretty good but it is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. It is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t because you can download the game for mac on websites but not on steam.
8867	1	a	This is a game you can put hours and hours into and still have something to do. It has a very helpful community and moderators are almost always online. There is a very wide variety of weapons and clothing and you can also get many vehicles. It has an online store if you go on gamersfirst but it doesn't really give any advantage in terms of strength or firepower, the best you can get is premium and new mounts. Some glitches here and there including teleporting AI and wallhacking AI but thats most games. I haven't ever seen a hacker my entire 230 hours of gameplay so thats always a plus. To sum it up, it has a good engine to play on, VERY HUGE map and so many different missions and items it will keep you busy for awhile.
8869	1	a	Love this game, the RPG elements are outstanding. Having third AND first person in an RPG is so fun, being able to fight monsters and such with tons and tons of weapons, too being able to get mounts such as horses and even cars! I recommend this game to everyone looking for an RPG mixed with an FPS. Thanks for the great game!(;
8871	1	a	this game first was a good game with some brilliant concepts now it has matured into a fantastic game with a lot of deapth and good multiplay. A real classic for its type and free to play a must have in the goodies cupboard
8873	1	a	HELL YEAH!! It's a very awesome combination of MM and FPS, the big world is amazing, the way every looks and feels around you is amazing!
8875	1	a	played this game for years now the devs never give new content or fix old bugs pure lazy dev team but for a frre to play game its one of best out there just dont hit max level to fast or bordom will follow
8877	1	a	Helluva lot of fun with friends. Or making friends inside. Big roleplaying community. Combat is very different, guns are difficult to use in a run and gun fashion, but it's mostly simple.
6339	0	a	kinda dont like it but i did only play it for like an hour
8879	1	a	Fallen Earth. This game could be so much more than it is, and it is a lot. It is sad that development has fallen to a snail's pace. This game features one of the best crafting systems in an MMO, where almost everything has to be crafted and can be crafted by you. Since it has gone F2P, it has not been relegated to a P2W game, just P4C.
8881	1	a	great rpg if you love fallout
8883	1	a	pritty cool for free have a go if u no likey u uninstally =)
8885	1	a	war has changed *radioated rat springs at you*
8887	1	a	Same as all free to play games.....WILL NOT START FFS 
8889	1	a	Great MMO,but graphics are kinda crappy
6342	0	a	Not my cup of tea.
6343	0	a	Very meh. Would not play again.
8891	1	a	good times. scavange. explore. craft a 2x4 and hit stuff.
8893	1	a	If I had some friends who like MMOs - the real life would become just useless. The game is great!
8895	1	a	this is a good action and aventure game for people who like killing stealing and dieing
8897	1	a	A Cool F2P Apocalypse game!
8899	1	a	great game to pass the time fun but hard to get anywhere and really hard to find friends
6347	0	a	Don't get this game. I got this thinking it would be like the online version of fallout. I was ever so wrong. The interface is confusing, enemy spawning is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and it altogether is a giant pile of mutant dung.
8901	1	a	Really Interesting Game, If You And Your Friends Like Kinda Sorta End Of The World Stuff Then You Will Like This Game. Although It Cannot Fully Capture The, 'End Of The World' Feel, Being An MMO And All.
8903	1	a	Great MMO,but graphics are kinda crappy
8905	1	a	Apart from the long grind this game has around lvl 5 and beyond. if you love fallout and post apocalyptic games then this for you
6349	0	a	Not very good. Even for free. Not worth the time.
8907	1	a	after playing for 41 hours i can tell you that this game is epic! theres soooo much to do like go hunting doing side quests or working towards gathering richers or building an atv or motorcycle or spending your riches on worthless thing when you start out just like i did   you can sit for hours killing and scaverging just to sit for hours and craft   but be carefuyl when further out in the wastes there are many CHOTA(chidren of the apocolipse) fortresses or towns out there and some of em can be full of dangers and well hundreds of CHOTA   overall i would give 12/10
8909	1	a	This game is exactly what i wanted it to be.... i have lost my self in this post apocalyptic world as if i was playing a fallout game  
6350	0	a	Since I have not played any of the Fallout games, I will not be making any comparisons to Fallen Earth. After playing this for a while, I thought this is a neat concept, but sadly fely this was a wasted opportunity to make a good mmo. First off, it runs like crap on low end computers and overall it felt really boing after a while. I'm pretty sure there are settings to boost performance, but either way, there really isn't all that much to do besides exploring the environment, which happens to be mostly flat desert until you are able to travel far away from the starting area and crafting weapons. Combat is dull as a sack of bricks so you can forget trying pvp since there is no cover and all I have seen is people dancing around in circles since the range on some of the guns are really short. That pretty much sums up on what I have to say about this game so if you like walikng around looking at terrain with occasional crafting then fine, but otherwise your time is better spent on something else.
8911	1	a	YES! this is the game i was looking for, it is old but extremly fun and awesome but there are some bad things like its mostly pay to play so dont expect much if you are just wanting to play without throwing in a few bucks but other than that its a nice game
8913	1	a	To put this game simple here are the pros and cons  Pros -The crafting systm is unique and refreshes your gameplay experince giving you better gameplay  -The game is open world giving you many places to travel -The looting system is common and easy to understand -The enemys in the game are unique from other characters you will see in games -The game is free to play -The game is not pay to win  Cons -The graphics are not the best -The game makes alot of people lag even with a good running system -The game has alot of bugs and when the server has to do maintenence it will take it awhile -The NPC seem dead they dont talk much -The Combat in the game is not the funniest thing you will do -The hud is all over the screen  Overall Graphics-5/10 Gameplay-7/10   So out of 20 i gave it a 12 but if you like free then this is your game    
6351	0	a	OK, I am not saying anything about the game (in fact never played the game), but i am saying somthing about the account system. The account system is the worst thing since the Pet Rock (thats an actual thing). The reason it's bad is because I can't login. Every acount I make from Gamerfirst I can't play with. So I make the account, then put my email, THEN my computer crashes. But it saves my email and nothing else. So when i try and make a new account, since it saves my email I can't make a new account. I can't login because the account doesn't exist. This happened every time with every game. Again not played the game, Just wasted an hour of my life on an account that is not real...
8915	1	a	Probably one of the best F2P games out there , well worth it
6352	0	a	Hm. Logged in once, error and close. Will not log in again. Thanks for the fun times! Edit: its designed to never close properly, so that the hours keep on ticking, and it looks like people are actually playing it. Ill go ahead and label this a harmful program, do not install it.
6353	0	a	Its ok, however the price of items of of merchants is way too high. The game features way too much grinding to do anything so its not worth it.
6354	0	a	Didn't care for the early game mechanics.  I feel other games can offer better packages of this theme.
6355	0	a	overall boring and difficult to really get into, the FPS elements are there but just not nearly refined enough to really attract a serious fan base other than people who have awesome computers to run it at maximum..With the release of it on Steam the bugs and server issues have gotten much much worse, and lag and really low Frame rates is more than common. Generally i give this game a 4/10 good idea, good back ground, great presentation, but poor game play, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor mechanics
8917	1	a	Positive: i absolutely love this game although i may not have much hours on it due to how busy i am, i still have some free time to play this game i love the graphics and i love how its not pushing you into doing things (in other words they are not forcing missions on you) i would recommend this game to anyone who loves medium paced games and games that you can basically do whatever you want. the only thing that i am not a big fan of is the price of gas for my atv, other than that this game is overall it is an okay game. Negative: although i may have a good review above i think i should put some negatives in the review. it has extreme lag even for my friend who happens to have great intenet and a beefy pc, the game needs to have seperate servers and it also needs to have a singleplayer added even if the servers cant be added due to money just add a singleplayer mode. i honestly think that the game needs to have a plot that actually goes somewhere, i may not have a ton of hours on it but i can tell by where i am at now the plot goes nowhere. i hate how people can interfere with your missions, it really sucks how i am doing a mission and soe other person can come up and kill everyone so i have to wait a while for them to respawn and have to basically restart. oh and on a recent mission i was not told how to use the weapon that they gave me so it took me 15 minutes to get someone to tell me how to use it and it was too late because i had 30 minutes to do the mission and i didnt finish it in time.  i would give this game a 5/10
6356	0	a	I did not enjoy this game one bit, the controls are really irritating and very hard to use. It gives very little information on how to even play. I do NOT recmend this game to anyone.
8919	1	a	Amazing game used to Co-run a clan of 300+ then took short break clan fell apart still think its my fault cause i left then all the other higher ups left as well. came back clan was dead want to play again just have noone to play with and solo/ random party raids get boring fast.
8921	1	a	Amazing game, I could play it forever. It's like a free Day Z, or kind of like a mix between Minecraft, Skyrim, and a modern/futuristic mmo. Just awesome. The best free game, or even overall, I have ever played
6358	0	a	Game was extremely messy and buggy.
6359	0	a	this game is so bad i cant stand how slow the game is its just bad 0/10
8923	1	a	Ever play Fallout and wish it were multiplayer? Then Fallen Earth is for you. Excellent atmosphere for role playing and definitely has a bit of a learning curve on the crafting system. Huge map and tons to explore. Extremely helpful, loyal community for an old game. Not one of those games you play through in a few hours. Getting bored? Stop and come back to it anytime. Absolutely recommend you donâ€™t skip the tutorial. 
8925	1	a	this is and outstanding game to play its like fallout and dayz mixed together you can get vehicals to drive horses to ride go on adventures kill monsters other people on the server get guns such as ak-47s but in the game they are diffrent names rifles shot guns pilstols and alot more
8927	1	a	So much fun from a well designed free to play game! Never thought they would be this good.
8929	1	a	this is a fun moltiplayer game with blood and guts :)
8931	1	a	If you are a fallout 3 or fallout new vegas fan then this is your game. If you played the ps3 version or any of the early releases of it you know what to expect.   It's a great game with great idea's a cool leveling system and a wide open world.  The community is generally pretty helpful and the beggining few levels give a lot to the new players to get going,  It's got a decent learing curve for leveling since it's not your typical level system, but overall i think it's good.  Aside from all that, it's glitchy as heck. first person view is good but glitchy and i mean glitchy! Combat lags, and glitches, and the overall world is glitchy meaning you will get stuck at somepoint. But the developers must have known this and gave you a skill to kill yourself to respawn at a nearby lifepod.  overall i would say this game is worth a go, and if you sub it's definitly better. but you can do alright without paying.  I would say overall i it get's a 6/10. needs work but worth a try.
6362	0	a	When I did downlaod the game, it would let me play even though I had made an account for this game. If there was something that I didn't do, please tell me. 
6363	0	a	This game give me â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥l cancer from the start to the finish plz fix game so many bugs   10/10 IGN
6364	0	a	This game had some high potentail, and it started out good too. Once I progressesed through the game, I realized, the mechanics sucked, and overall it just gets worse and worse the longer you play.
8933	1	a	tis cool mang
6365	0	a	Have tried to start the game several times. In the beginning, it would not even let me log in with my Steam ID. Later on, and also now, it starts updating something and quickly gets into an infinite loop trying to update and check data. Still have yet to experience any of this game... (Uninstall works, at least I hope so...)
8935	1	a	itÂ´s a good game, a bit difficult the further into the game you get. However, some obstacles have not stopped anyone from trying until you passed it. Any good gamer can agree.
8937	1	a	This game looks great and it's gameplay is good too!
6367	0	a	help me i tried to create an account to play this game but it keeps on saying sorry an error occured pls help me i wanna really play this game psl
8939	1	a	This game is all ive wanted in a open world game. its huge and stratigic and ive never had a game experiance like this. id get this game instead of fallout hands down. it blows all other games of its kind out of the water
8941	1	a	It is a fun game. The controls are a bit wonky but it is free and more good than not
8943	1	a	do not play it it sucks 
8945	1	a	Best game I ever played!
8947	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
6369	0	a	Tried to ride a horse. But was then kicked by the admin for animal abuse... 2/2 best game ever, do get, do pay 200 dollars for premium, do play. REALISM.
8949	1	a	highly recommend if you like the fallout series mainly new vegas and fallout 3 this game is a little bit different though because theres a big emphasis on crafting and there are mounts and its multiplayer but kindof the same setting as fallout with the whole desert waistland and mutated creatures and factions
6370	0	a	dont play this  its okay but not as worth your time as some other similar games
6371	0	a	Trust me when I say this game is awful. It has terrible loading times and over all is a glitchy mess to play. And since it's a free to play game it is legally obligated to have microtransactions in it, and boy are there plenty.
8951	1	a	I will keep this simple. It is basically Fallout as an mmo. 10/10 Takes some getting used to though. :/
6372	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8953	1	a	This game was ok, its a pretty decent MMO, the only downside, is the Enemies, they respawn rather quickly, and if your on a quest to get an object thats surrounded by idk 20 enemy NPC's if your not mega-high level to take them down quick (or if you dont have someone with you like that) youll get through half before they start showing up again, and then youll have to deal with all the new NPC's as well.
8955	1	a	Good game for the price lol
8957	1	a	Great game I really like games of this kind and I convinced all my friends to download this game, and they really liked this game!
8959	1	a	Worst f2p game in the world awful controls awful gameplay you spend most of the game getting stuff for people and all you ever get for compeleting quests are dumb books first person mode looks like you're playing it on gamecube
8961	1	a	Its Moreso fun if you have a Clan or a group of friends to play with. Alone it can be quite boring.
6374	0	a	This game is dogshite. Graphics suck, lag out the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, long install time, not at all what was advertized. Controls clunky and enemies are stupid. This is a barely held together string of flawed code.
8963	1	a	great game
6377	0	a	For those of you somewhat interested in this game, I can review it for you in three words: No, Just No.
8965	1	a	alsome game
6378	0	a	lagy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you like bad garfics and bad evrything this is your game i have a good pc and it kills it it can run far cry 3 in fine gafs do not get this game. and yes i do know its free
8967	1	a	Wow. Very cool game. Kind of rough and crude, but honestly feels like Fallout 1 in FPS.
8969	1	a	Definitely fun. Post apocalyptic MMOFPS with crafting and vehicles. It can get pretty deep. Graphics are just OK, but the game is fun so I never notice. It's also free to play.
8971	1	a	Like Fallout but multiplayer :D
8973	1	a	This game has its own unique charm. I mainly played it when it was a P2P payment model. It has gotten a lot better and is unfortunatly under-rated. Although it still has some of its issues with animations and what not there is something that sparkles in this MMO's eyes. The crafting is genius and sometimes it feels like im in a real open world experience. Its built well to immerse you out of the MMO feel and not in a bad way. The combat is fun since you can approach it many different ways. Again with the crafting, its amazing.   There is absoultely nothing as satisfying as crafting your first ATV. Its a pinnacle moment of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yeah im bad. Another thing i really like is the no class style along with the in depth RPG elements. Im not really a fan of no class MMO's but it works perfect for Fallen Earth. My main issues with the game is for some people it can be somewhat confusing although the new tutorial is really helpful. I hope the community welcomes people who try the game with open arms. It would be a shame if it ever got shut down. City of Heroes was a tragic loss in all honesty for the MMO genre and would equally be so if Fallen Earth was to. Remember FE players, never make the new guys hate the game because you want to be an Eliteist and call the noobs and what not. That helps games die away.   All in all. My experience with FE has been one of a kind. Im going to give it another go with the F2P and see where i can go all over again. If you havent tried it, give it a go. Its worth getting into. It will seem odd and wierd at first but once you get used to it you will discover the genius behind this game.
6379	0	a	dont play this game for it sucks really bad!
8975	1	a	great game to play for hour or sokill stuff get horsess and atvs it's prety sweet
8977	1	a	Same as all free to play games.....WILL NOT START FFS 
6380	0	a	Was not fond of it 30 seconds in. Did not even give it a chance, looked like poor mans fallout. HUD way too cluttered right at the start.
8979	1	a	Really good game its just like fallout only set online
6381	0	a	game wouldn't let me change my username and when i went to go log in the game kicked me from the launcher.
8981	1	a	this is and outstanding game to play its like fallout and dayz mixed together you can get vehicals to drive horses to ride go on adventures kill monsters other people on the server get guns such as ak-47s but in the game they are diffrent names rifles shot guns pilstols and alot more
8983	1	a	looks like a promising game ill have to look at it after i start playing it tho
8985	1	a	*SQUAWK*
8987	1	a	Like a less fun version of fallout but its free!
8989	1	a	It's not Fallout online, but since falout online got cancelled, this is the the equivalent of Champiosn compared to City of Heroes. It's not what we wanted, but it's a god damned good attempt.
8991	1	a	'This is one of the most epic games ever!'
8993	1	a	Definitely the best game you don't have to buy.  Fallout Simulator to the max.  That being said......it is amazing, and it is addictive. Even more fun when you meet new friends to help you with quests!
8995	1	a	Nice game if you have some free time. Just try to scratch out of living like in my glourious Poland.
8997	1	a	great idea fun for a good while. gets repetative but what MMO dosent
8999	1	a	Amazing game, it's free, third person, not much else to say, download, play, have fun!
6384	0	a	During my short time with Fallen Earth, I don't think there was a moment where I wasn't bored. One way of putting it is 'the game has a steep learning curve', but in reality that just means it has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ controls and convoluted mechanics elsewhere. Bad, even for an MMO.
9001	1	a	Insidiously addictive. The Wild Wild West meets the Apocalypse.
9003	1	a	not bad..weird as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but not bad,game is kind of confusing only complaint so far at two hours into it
6386	0	a	Community was atrocious. Immediately killed by other users. Scolded for accidentially using caps and then harassed.
9005	1	a	I don't recomend this game. I haven't even played it...and that's the problem. It takes forever just to check for updates. When you actually get in the game, there's no cursor or anything. It's hard to push any buttons it displays. I can't even click the freakin PLAY button. If this happens to you, don't even bother. If it doesn't, play away.
9007	1	a	its REALLY. i mean REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY laggy close to the start of the game. im not going to give any spoilers but close to where u meet the first people that tha help u. im talk extremly laggy. but mabey it can be fixed in the otions, how knows, but i sorda like the idea of the game
9009	1	a	Good Game and Good Gameplay I Reccomend This To People Who Like DayZ and Unturned
9011	1	a	of coruse
9013	1	a	Dasterd, Tell me your steam name oh and also, this game is really neato
6387	0	a	WORST GAME EVER!! It's a piece of crap and poorly deisnged. It probably gets funner at higher levels but it takes forever to get there. it's a waste of space on a computer.
9015	1	a	This was very good.  Allowed character customization Sort of like DayZ first person + third person perspective EPIC
9017	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
6390	0	a	This game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t i can't even get into the game for 2seconds whithout it freezing and crashing my computer
9019	1	a	Yes it is a very fun game and adventureous.
6391	0	a	This game needs a lot of work before it can become even close to being good.
6392	0	a	Probably the worst Post Apocalyptic Survival i have played. So much lag, graphics are completely terrible, i noticed a lot of hacking as well along with overpowered enemies and you have to put tons of money into the game to be able to get anything good. As of all the game is not worth it, it is a waste of time and space.  2/10 i would say to be honest, The game has achieved to be on steam and has gotten many players to play it. But everything is off on it completely. And also to add the website is off 80% of the time and so is the main server. (I have played for a whole day\24 hours and it still sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥...)
9021	1	a	My most Favorite game of all time .. This game has everything a wast lander could ask for, Open world(Sandbox) lots of equipment and weapons .. I truly love this game.
9023	1	a	Definitely the best game you don't have to buy.  Fallout Simulator to the max.  That being said......it is amazing, and it is addictive. Even more fun when you meet new friends to help you with quests!
6394	0	a	If your going to play this because it looks like Fallout, don't. It's much much much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ier.
6395	0	a	dont play this game for it sucks really bad!
9025	1	a	What is Fallen Earth? Fallen Earth like a MMO Metro 2033 only minus Russians talking in English with silly Reznov voices.
6396	0	a	This game is messy and is free for a reason. Just simple dont play it, there is more out there that is WAY better.
9027	1	a	This game is a very fun game its kinda like the games fall out and its even FPS or TPS and trust me u will have a blast. 
9029	1	a	fun looking game can not wait to lvl up
9031	1	a	not to bad, but if your playing in a group its a pain in the A** to find them.
9033	1	a	GREAT!! IT AWSOME
9035	1	a	I have started playing this game this week and have found it to be a enjoyable one. the game is much like fallout if you liked that game then you would enjoy. the graphics are ok but i find that this gives this game a diffrent feel and in away the fact theat their not amazing has given it a diffrent look and aspect and me personal enjoye this about it as now a days its all about the graphics and this gives a brake from that. thir seems to be a problem with the landscape loading and then doesent buffer as well as not a frecent movement seem to be laggey ( friends have had same problem) but besides that what i have played so far is enjoyable. i would recomend this game to people who enjoy games like fallout.hope you have the same enjoyment i have had and i hope it continuse thought the game for me
9037	1	a	not to bad, but if your playing in a group its a pain in the A** to find them.
9039	1	a	ver y ver y very good game i'd class it as A 'Sandbox' mmo witch are ma favroute type of games 'sandox' ones exept in strategy games lol
9041	1	a	pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
9043	1	a	Pretty fun, and different. Cheaply made models for some things, and some odd bugs, controls are confusing but it's.. alright?  7/10
6398	0	a	If you like fallout this game will be for you. A bad thing about it thougs is the crearing an account i have created an account and it wont let me log in after first time playing it. If the account creating was a bit better i would play more but untill this gets sorted i will not be playin this game again
9045	1	a	Like a Fallout New Vegas MMORPG, the creators of this game are genius! So much to do, so much to see and so many items to get, this game is one of the most addictive things ive ever played
9047	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
9049	1	a	10 out of 10, since it was released in 2009 still one of the best post-apocalyptic MMORPG of all time! I recommend for anyone who likes Fallout or similar games and for every people who wants a new taste of mmorpg! The graphics are not as the same as a new released mmorpg but the gameplay and the roleplay is magnificent! Try it out, and have fun!
6401	0	a	will not let me log in keeps saying invalid account or password can anyone help
6402	0	a	I was really looking forward to this game, until I had to 'sign up' and then wait for an email that never came. I can't recommend a game i literally can't play.
6403	0	a	i recommend this
9051	1	a	i want to play this game but im confused on how to sign in, i made an account to play, can someone please help me on how to sign in.
6404	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
9053	1	a	The Animations may be simple and the game may be buggy, but its a great game nun the less and if the smooth they animations and fix some of the bugs this game will be amazing. This game realy has some great potential.........ACE!!!!
6405	0	a	99% of my playtime was figuring out what the problem with the launch was.
9055	1	a	This games is a little hard to describe without saying the phrases 'Fallout 3', 'New Vegas', 'MMORPG', or 'Son of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I can holster HOW many weapons!?'   It certainly wasn't the game I was expecting, but it is the game I've been looking for, in a way. It's a perfectly/near-perfectly executed post-apocalypse MMORPG, and that's a rarity. My only complaints are that I found it looking for something else entirely, and that the story at the beginning reminds me of the early 90's Apoc D&amp;D settings. Otherwise, it gives you a horse two minutes in, something most MMORPGs take you days to get, and then they're usually expensive and just sort of bleh. In this case, I was just given a free horse, and it felt like it actually made sense. You're in a desert wasteland. Here, the one thing you need the most, in a desert wasteland.   And you can holster six weapons at once. I have a fireaxe, a rifle, two knives, and two pistols. I look like some sort of crazy gunslinger, and I'm not even an hour into the game!   Overall, as first impressions go, unless this game just suddenly becomes awful, this is probably the best MMORPG I've seen in years.
9057	1	a	i havent played much but heres what i think so far. The community is amazing most people are friendly when i made my character almost immediately was i invited to a clan from then he gave me a more in depth tutorial bought me a horse and some feed . graphics amazing considering its f2p . gameplay good but the crafting is a little confusing but once you figure it out its smooth sailing . overall 9.7/10 not perfect but close fed my thirst for more games like fallout
9059	1	a	I played this game abit now, and I quit for along time, I had no frineds playing as a FEW lost connections. There are minor things, but it is a good game. The first things to KNOW/DO is find the NATURE teacher and get GEOLOGY going and Start farming. Each Town has missions, and then Missions to SEND you to other areas, you dont need to follow them, but they will PUSH you up the levels. There are MANY types of levels in this game.. WORK your SKILLS, and BUILD what you can..Your SKILLS are important...and then Look at the WIKI and decide WHERE you want your abilities.
9061	1	a	My friend found this game just scrolling through the Free to Play games one day and I am so glad he did. I probably would've never seen it if he wasn't just looking. This game is amazing! I love Fallout and this game has many themes that feel just like Fallout does, and it adds multiplayer to the game. Just got it last night and we played for 8 hours straight! amazing game!
9063	1	a	Just wish I could play it on GNU/Linux. Then I could finally leave Windows behind.
6408	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9065	1	a	this game would be fun if it work 
9067	1	a	This game is sorta like the fallout series, but some very noticeable differences. you can create items from raw materials, which range from simple farming(actual farming, you know, with veggies and stuff) to badass looking vehicles (along with weapons) there are several tradeskills, such as construction, armorcraft and ballistics, skills such as, intelligence, perception etc. to level up and to benefit your playstyle, there is an auction to sell off on the worldwide auction to the highest bidder, the story is very interesting in my opinion, seeing that you are a clone that never truly stays dead. there are quests to complete, items to craft, enemies, including bosses to fight and several sectors to explore. i highly recommend this game if you are a fan of mmorpg's and post apocalyptic gaming
9069	1	a	Great Game, could use a little reboot and the system is a little old, so its good just has a lack of detail.
9071	1	a	Good game with Oblivion and Fallout elements
9073	1	a	When starting the game: First impressions are this is a cheap game with no controlls, but after getting into the game after a good half hour and doing some major controll reconstuction in the settings this game is really fun! I just want to have waypoints for quests I havent put to much of my time into this game so far but is blowing me away.
9075	1	a	i dowloaded it....everything was fine and then i got to the start menu. i pressed the button to create a ew account repeatedly and it didnt work. 
6410	0	a	This game is NOT what the pictures look like. Sure it LOOKS fun but it really isnt. SO glad this game is free to play.
6411	0	a	The game 'Fallen Earth' is but a sorry excuse for a free-to-play game. This game- not being worth the memory needed to download it - would be better off unplayed and unexplored. It does manage to show a slight glimmer of a good idea/story. However it is poorly executed and continuously provides a relentless assault on both the visual and mental parts of peoples minds. With its terrible graphics and horiffic story, it made it impossible to play. Aside from the 'fantastic' amount of frames per second when I walked near an elevator, I was able to do nothing but fail to complete a mission as my game would not run past a low 12 fps. My computer plays 'Arma 3' on high at 38 fps and 'Battlefield 3' on high at 43 fps. Yet a game with graphics at par to a nintendo 64, I can not play it at past 12 fps on low graphics. Do not get this game because of the fasad of a good story. All it provides is bordem and poor execution.
6412	0	a	Boring, alot of walking, cool ideas but it's not what I'm looking for in a game.
9077	1	a	I found this game very easy to start and follow along. Free to play or Cost an â™¥â™¥â™¥ load it has it all.
9079	1	a	really good
6414	0	a	don't bother to download, this game is unplayable  i don't know if the server is laggy or the game is glitchy but i can't even hit an enemy in the tutorial mode (the enemy still can hit me), and the animation is so slow. if you have bunch of bandwidth and time to waste, you might want to try it by yourself.
9081	1	a	This game has really great atmosphere. That is because most of the content is ripped straight from the Wasteland/Fallout universe. If you ever wanted to play a Fallout-ish MMO, this is the best choice. It's more focused on crafting and the whole 'carrot on the stick' gameplay, and of course you can just buy the carrot. I really enjoyed the short time I spent in game.  I'm torn about this game because, quite frankly, the community is just awful. Instead of Zone chat like in most mmo's, there's a Help chat. It's filled with players that have been there for a while, but most of them have that whole 'elite' attitude. Help chat is supposed to be used for people with questions, thus the name. These 'Elitists' will use Help chat for anything they want, berate and accuse new players of trolling, then turn around and lecture everyone on the 'proper way' to use Help chat. The GM's are even worse. They constantly hand out mutes/bans, but ignore any complaints towards the preffered players that have been there for a long time or spent probably $500 in the cash shop.   Also, the GM's are crazy about censoring peoples' screen names. I had a name that wasn't even offensive, I played for a bit and when I came back, my name was Cupcake1244. Yes, if they deem your name offensive, you get to roam the Wastelands as Cupcake____. And you only get 1 character slot as a F2P player. I contacted a GM about changing my name and guess what? Oh, you can BUY a name change in the cash shop. $10 because you got offended for no reason? Hah!  Unfortunately, I'm the type of person that's going to argue right back with you when you're acting douchey. So I told everyone off in Help chat and am uninstalling :)   To sum it up, if you enjoy the crafting side of mmo's with a Fallout/Wasteland atmosphere, go for it. But if you're not going to spend money on it, I'd suggest that you keep the chat window closed and just chat with people locally. You're going to want to avoid these Basement-Dwellers.
9083	1	a	fallen earth is an impressive game as the graphics are aesthetically pleasing and the amount of in game items (trinkets weapons armor etc.) is immense. however the game is hindered by having very few non-pvp areas.
6416	0	a	Not very good. Even for free. Not worth the time.
9085	1	a	I havent played much of fallen earth yet but i can allredy tell it is going to be a very awesome game and experience....keep up the good work on your games....also if you are having trouble sighing up then waht you have to do is make another e-mail account, i know you may not want to do it but this game is defenitly worth it.
9087	1	a	YEP, this game made me love knives EVEN MORE!!!! GET IT DAMNIT!!!
9089	1	a	get killed and eat sandvich 10/10 
9091	1	a	Allo poppets, anuva reveiw...  So... Fallen Earth, an MMORPG set in post-apocalyptic america, original I know, but the the game itself is, actually quite unique, if a bit lacking in areas. Having only limited tim on this one so far I can say this for sure, it could be so much more than its is, visually and in actual gameplay. Thats not to say it isnt still a good game and enjoyble thus far.  The storyline seems fairly original (to me at least), and the character creation is fairly in depth, skills and progression of characters are simple and fairly rapid, but the thing that really set this one apart is the XP system which i will describe in detail below.  In Fallen Earth you start as a clone in a lab and must 'break free', but once you are free of the lab, the wasteland of the Grand Canyon, USA, has much to offer in the way of chr. progression options, meaning you dont have to be a warrior, or combatant of any kind (though you will need to be able to defend yourself), you can make a living and progress in Lvl &amp; skill by travelling the wastes and scavenging, harvesting and collecting supplies and refuse of all kind, and, either crafting/building things from them or just selling them.  The combat and equipment system is pretty cool (although complicated at first), as you can choose a wide array of weaponry to equip and even use in combination i.e; Pistol in one hand and blade in the other or sword and axe etc., which I found very fun. Most weapons and armour can be crafted with the neccessary skill, and clothing/armor can even be dyed for an extra touch of personalisation.  There are also many Mounts, pets, and vehicles to accompy you, or be used throughout your travels in the wastes, and you don't have to pay real money to get them, though the best ones are only on the market. Nor do you have to pay real cash to get/tame pets, just spend game 'chips'(the currency of the wastes) to get the corresponding item, i.e; Wasteland Hound Leash will allow you to obtain/tame a dog/wolf pet.  The only downside as I touched on earlier is the fact that its very 'un-polished' thus far, some part of dialogue texts are even grossly miss-spelt or nonsensical, and it gets a little glitchy in some areas, especially when there is a heavy populatio of players in-game. This lack of 'finesse' does detract quite a bit from the game, however, as you can see the great potential this title has, hopefully coming updates will fix these issues.  When alls said and done this is , at least, worth a look due to the involved Role-play aspect and wide exploration capabilities, just dont expect a highly polished experience...  I'm rating it 5.5 out of 10 Red Poker Chips
9093	1	a	great game
9095	1	a	Fallen Earth was OK.Not one of the best games I played,but not terrible.There are many errors to it,and in the beggining the gameplay is a little dull,but overall its a decent game mostly for fans of fallout 3.
6419	0	a	downloaded, played a while, realized I rather have genital cancer, decided to go to work instead
9097	1	a	fun as hell
9099	1	a	Best survival Free2play game on steam
9101	1	a	Great game. Lots of fun things to do, huge area to explore.
6420	0	a	This game actually sucks. I thought it would be really cool but ended up having a game-freezing bug every time a door opened. 1/10
9103	1	a	This game isn't half bad; honestly I thought it was going to have the same or similar graphics as LOTRO but it surpassed my expecation of such. The keys and buttons are kinda hard to learn when you are so used to a certain system of keys, but once you get the hang of it the fights can go smoothly.
9105	1	a	The poor man's Fallout: New Vegas.   7.2/10
9107	1	a	Kind of boring to be honest. It's alright though, feels like Fallout online. If you like fallout and mmo's then you shoudl try it out.
6426	0	a	Game was extremely messy and buggy.
9109	1	a	this game its awesome so cool know i have 20 friends thinks to this game who ever make this game its the best
9111	1	a	Fast-paced, fun, and definately intresting. This game provides many elements and game styles that most newer games lack. This MMO is a must play.
9113	1	a	Scratches that fallout itch for post apocalypse good overall free to play. 7/10
6427	0	a	cant even log in
6428	0	a	i'd rather have a rabid bear tear my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off than play this game again
9115	1	a	Fallout + WoW = Best written MMORPG I've played so far, only hindered by ugly UI, awkward controls and A.I.
9117	1	a	Not bad, just not great.  Fallout 3 with no VATS.  Cool for a free game.
6429	0	a	monotonous and boring. also a cash cow pay to win.
9119	1	a	I've had so much fun running around, picking up bits of plastic :)
9121	1	a	play this awsome game 
9123	1	a	Very good game if you like walking through destroyed cities, scavenging and looking on radioactivenes mutants.
6432	0	a	Terrible Game, Terrible Systeam, Spent 38 minutes trying to Log In to the game and that is just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up and this game should be removed from the Steam Store, its a waiste of Space its a waiste of everything... Its just a massive Scam
9125	1	a	If you like apocolypse type games, this one is great. IF you like CRAFTING! THIS is the best game ever for it. well close enough. XD
9127	1	a	I thought the game has some real charm to it. Despite the high level of people who comment, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing about how hard the game can is (if you can't follow basic instructions then you should be playing on a console, not a PC).
9129	1	a	I really like this game, it's just that it's starting to feel old and I want something more and something new. I can't find a game like this anywhere else and it makes me sad.
9131	1	a	Ok so many things wrong with this game even for early access, Graphics need's alot of work things look really bland to me, maybe look at borderlands concept art or fallout big thing these teams did was take pictures lots of pitures of real life places. Google is a good cheap alternative the horse was modeled really well, clearly had photo reference. Character movement is clunky and your always getting caught on stuff like stairs and doors, try using a low res UV Sphere the collision detection is well old and outdated for modern games. Another option is to put an invisible ramp on stair's and make the box smaller cuz right now it barely fits through the doors. This is my biggest complaint with the game and is something that should be fixible easily if the code is well written. I create a new method for all object in the game and it subsequent object's and states so they can easily be called and tracked. So a player chacter would be one class and everything it needs to make it work is in that class. each part of the character is then section out like arm bone move is in one method collision detection and its position is tracked by that method. Lessons learned from the masters john carmak's books as well Brenda Romaro A.K.A (Brenda Brathwaite) has alot of good books wolfgang engel would be another too look at, he is one of the top graphics programmers in the world. Other then those two massive issues it looking real good for early access and runs pretty well. I will be checking in for the movement fix;  
9133	1	a	Yeah its good, Not a waist of time. Bacically its your opinon on games
9135	1	a	It kept me busy before fallout and will keep me busy after fallout, great game great community. Does need new content badly though. Until then there is still lots to explore and do. Totally addicted
9137	1	a	Meh i played worst but its ok
6442	0	a	Character customization is decent. Concept is good. Default keybinds are not intuitive, and make switching weapons clunky - especially since there's no way to draw two one-handed weapons at once. Skill/AP system looks shiny enough, but there is no apparent in-game info on what's most beneficial/what should be focused on - ask on the help channel, and you get pointed to the wiki site. I'd rather be able to play the game than spend all day doing research on a wiki. Combat is awkward, with targeting being off to one side of the character rather than in front, and the hitboxes seem off sometimes. Running away/kiting doesn't seem to be a viable option, as melee enemies are able to hit you from several feet away - you'll just die tired.  Found the game on a top 20 MMO list, decided to give it a try. Was excited to find there might be an RP element, but never saw any of that in-game - might be difficult as a F2P player to RP anyway, since there's no access to public channels? Must be at least a 'Freemium' player for that.
9139	1	a	Cool 
6445	0	a	In comparison to the other MMO's I've had the opportunity to play this one is not as engaging or appealing.  It lacks the visual draw, the voice over acting, the sound effects, the action, etc. after Â½ an hour I decided it wasnâ€™t worth the time to develop the toon.   Unlike SWTOR/ SWG/GW/GW2/DDO/NWN/WOT/RIFT this game does not have a draw factor for me and I was looking forward to it after reading the review stating that if you like melancholy open world no pressure to get mission done games this is for you.  Wishing them luck with a re-boot if it comes to that.  
9141	1	a	i absoulutly love this game. First time i have ever found a game with great deatail and lil to no lag .
9143	1	a	This is one of the best mixes of a Wasteland MMORPG if you want a game to hang out with or complete quests with friends you should really try this game.
9145	1	a	The best mission-threads of any MMO I've ever played. Post-Nuke Bliss! ...but eventually PVP is going to rear its head, so be forewarned, if that's not 'your cup of meat'. I give it 8 out of 10, and no one gets a 10
9147	1	a	Great Game! Lots of story, gameplay, and awesome players who will help you out along the way! I wish there were a few more options to reduce lag though.
9149	1	a	dont forget your password or create mutiple accounts it wont be pretty but the gameplay is good 
9151	1	a	Great game one of the best! If you enjoy Fallout you will love this game!
6447	0	a	horable game devs worked none on this game pray that this game gets taken off steam
6448	0	a	Well, the character creation was pretty neat. Sadly, that's the only part of this game I was able to experience -- as soon as I entered the game world, I was dumped into an angular white void and then crashed mere minutes later. Can't say I'm impressed.
9153	1	a	fallout mmo takes time to do anything
9155	1	a	Good Game. I Just Think It Could Been a Lot Better. :)
9157	1	a	I really like this game, it's just that it's starting to feel old and I want something more and something new. I can't find a game like this anywhere else and it makes me sad.
9159	1	a	fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things
9161	1	a	I thought the game has some real charm to it. Despite the high level of people who comment, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing about how hard the game can is (if you can't follow basic instructions then you should be playing on a console, not a PC).
9163	1	a	it would be nice to know when you make your account your user name with out having to research it. kind of pointless making you use a username as a password if you dont know it because the game company made one for you and didnt tell you it. learning this was stupid on the game developers part.
6454	0	a	game sucks balls
9165	1	a	Class post apocolyptic game.
6455	0	a	Eh. Played for a few hours. Not as fun as I thought it'd be. Slow - paced, boring roleplay game. Not recommended.
6456	0	a	This Game Is Pretty Cancer, Most Of Time You Literally Don't Know What You Are Doing... This Game Gave Me Cancer.
6457	0	a	its crap
9167	1	a	Used to be sweet, now G1 bought em out and it kinda sucks. Free2play Pay2win
9169	1	a	awesome game u should try it 
6458	0	a	bad game, wierd controls and bad graphics
9171	1	a	I plan on playing Fallen Earth for a while to see how it goes, and as such, this review will see updates from time to time when I see big changes.  *REVIEW* As a player starting off in Fallen Earth, you're greeted by your Character Creation Screen. Everyone seems to have the same kind of build, with height being the main difference. Good choices for customisation and whatnot, but nothing ground breaking.  The Tutorial is straightforward and simple. There is no 'Hand-Holding' as such in it, just the basics of gameplay and combat. Here, you are introduced into what seems to be an OK story.  Why is the story OK? Well, it's corny ('You are special' is what you're told, but yet your just an ordinary guy by the looks of it) and a bit narrative. You don't need a Ph.D to figure out the story from what every NPC tells you, who seem to be devoid of opinions and just state facts.  Controls-wise, it seems ok. WASD, 1-0, Shift+1-0 etc. Pretty standerd stuff, but that's not a bad thing. The controls are quite nice to play with, and I haven't decided to re-bind any keys which is a boon.   Combat is simple enough from what I have seen, but has possabilities in the perks and skills you unlock. IMO, Ranged Weaponry seem to have the dominancy in this game. The rifle you find in the Tutorial is a staple weapon and really easy to use.   The voice actors seem to be good in this game, and they add an air of professionalism to the game.   *Verdict* All in all, a solid game that looks good from the get-go. The â‚¬0/$0/Â£0 price tag is nice, so I would recommend everyone try this game for at least 30 minutes, just to see how things pan out.
6460	0	a	I watched this game's download bar with great anticipation. Then I played it. And then I deleted it. After 15 minutes of playing. Seriously. The description states that Fallen Earth blends FPS and TPS into an awesome postapocalytpic RPG and stuff. The first preson mode is trippy to the point of being unusable, while the overall sensation you get while playing is, well, bad. Slighty burning in the gut. Go get S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Fallout. Seriously.
9173	1	a	this is a great game, if you like rpg and mmo this is for YOU! Of course they will always be the bad comments, but i recommend this game for all of u fans of rpg and mmo!
6466	0	a	i beta tested this game it was buggy then. i bought it played for a few weeks. quit because nothing was getting fixed. came back after it went free to play. an the same bugs an the laggy areas where still there. the only thing that changed was . they had change some of the areas too look different.
9175	1	a	PS2 graphics...  WoW harvesting mechanics and a little more detail than WoW crafting.  The controls were made by a 5 year old... if you have a multi-button mouse a good scroll wheel and you don't mind pressing Tab every 5 seconds it's not that bad.  The combat mechanics are sluggish, ranged weapons are the way to go as anything melee doesn't hit even though your weapon passes right through them.  Most of it is like as if WoW and EVE Online had a baby that was missing a limb or two &gt;.&lt;  It takes at least the first couple missions to get over the learning curve of the game mechanics and controls, other than what I mentioned at the start it gets better quickly... you also get a mount (horse) right at the starter area so it's great for exploration.  I'll be playing more of this game to see how far I can get in it without it being dullified otherwise I would recommend this to anyone who want's an WoW/EVE Online game experience, yes it takes real-time to craft things, it takes 'Skill Books', you are a clone, you have to mine/salvage minerals to craft... it's all pretty much an EVE Online game made 3rd/1st Person shooter.
9177	1	a	Very fast pace :3 
6469	0	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. dont bother.
6470	0	a	overall boring and difficult to really get into, the FPS elements are there but just not nearly refined enough to really attract a serious fan base other than people who have awesome computers to run it at maximum..With the release of it on Steam the bugs and server issues have gotten much much worse, and lag and really low Frame rates is more than common. Generally i give this game a 4/10 good idea, good back ground, great presentation, but poor game play, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor mechanics
6471	0	a	Client/Downloader is janky as balls.  2 hours restarting, re-cleaning, verifying, starting again just to try and get the install working... Nope.  Stuck at 18% everytime.  140MB to go... Dies.  If you're going to insist on taking the game away from Steam and have you're own Client to handle updates/updating/installs, then I suggest you fix it quick.  Featured on Steam... Game is broke.
9179	1	a	Fallen Earth is an entertaining MMORPG set in the apocolyptic future. You play as one of countless clones with an unknown past and future, searching for more than an identity. With countless factions to join, aid, and/or harm, you the player are able to advance and change the storyline of the world. With countless means of combat from guns, explosives, mutations, psionics, and even swords and axes, you can find all a manner of ways to customize your battle experience. With a crafting system that will let you make almost everything in the game as well you can be certain you will almost always be able to make and use anything you find and/or see. The use of third person view for exploration and interaction and first person view for combat may be of some concern for some players, along with the need to explore select areas in groups, but otherwise, the game is easy to get used to and play on your own.
9181	1	a	Positive: i absolutely love this game although i may not have much hours on it due to how busy i am, i still have some free time to play this game i love the graphics and i love how its not pushing you into doing things (in other words they are not forcing missions on you) i would recommend this game to anyone who loves medium paced games and games that you can basically do whatever you want. the only thing that i am not a big fan of is the price of gas for my atv, other than that this game is overall it is an okay game. Negative: although i may have a good review above i think i should put some negatives in the review. it has extreme lag even for my friend who happens to have great intenet and a beefy pc, the game needs to have seperate servers and it also needs to have a singleplayer added even if the servers cant be added due to money just add a singleplayer mode. i honestly think that the game needs to have a plot that actually goes somewhere, i may not have a ton of hours on it but i can tell by where i am at now the plot goes nowhere. i hate how people can interfere with your missions, it really sucks how i am doing a mission and soe other person can come up and kill everyone so i have to wait a while for them to respawn and have to basically restart. oh and on a recent mission i was not told how to use the weapon that they gave me so it took me 15 minutes to get someone to tell me how to use it and it was too late because i had 30 minutes to do the mission and i didnt finish it in time.  i would give this game a 5/10
6474	0	a	Can not create a character guess they dont want anymore new players.
6475	0	a	wasteoftime/10
9183	1	a	As Space Cowboy said below 'IMHO, this is one of the best and underrated MMOs I've player on my entire gaming life (20 years of gaming so far).  Why, you might ask me? I'll tell ya.  STORY: The background story is amazing and it mixes Fallout series, Mad Max movies and also A Boy and His Dog references (if you ever saw this movie, you, sir, consider yourself lucky). The game has an unique atmosphere aswell. Not only a futurist set, but a post-apocalyptic one, finely made.   MAP: The map is HUGE, I mean, HUGE (already tell ya that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is huge?!). You could spent like 8-10 hours to cross the sectors on foot, if you make it alive.   CRAFTING:  Forget everything else about other's game crafting. This is THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   You can craft your own vehicles or train your own animals! Ride a mutant chicken or a horse (you can have many, many different kind of horses) or go in a bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ mode on a bike.  You can craft almost everything, even tents, campsites and stuff like that to get temporary area buffs.  Craft armors, firearms, melee weapon, explosives, medicine, steroids, recipes, foods, drinks, mutagenics... the list is so big that probably I'd spend all the reviews talking about it.   Also, you need to craft ammunition for your weapons and gas, diesel or biodiesel for your vehicles, besides ration for your animals and repair kits for heal equipment damage from fights.   After all, even if it bothers some people, I must say that I LOVE the time required to crafting. Everything you make by crafting need proper time to get done, from just a few secs to hours or even weeks. A single tire for a car requires 8-12 hours.   COMBAT: It's a partial FPS where you need to land your blows and aim to shot manually. No auto-target, which is great for PvP. Headshots cause a lot of extra fatal damage, rewarding you for your skill player.  The game have a lot of customization, meaning your character can max various skills to fulfill different roles on a party or even solo. You could be a mutant DPS or a healer, a gunslinger, a rifleman, sniper, fight with a big axe, two tires, be a sneaking rogue, a buffer/debuffer leader or pretty much anything.  PVP:  Awesome.  The game is partial-PvP. I mean, it's not a full PvP map, but, instead, we have PvP zones. On these zones, players need to fight over rare resources like petroleum! People can build settlements and siege-like stuff aswell.  The game has 6 factions which the player can join. Each one has it's owns charateristics, RP-related and PvP gear. These factions are at war/alliance relationships with each other.  The game also have a lot of player's guilds and alliances and people Pvping over resource nodes and PvP zones.  MORE PROS (MORE AWESOME IN YOUR AWESOMENESS): - Not just more of the same. It really brings something NEW and FRESH to MMO players looking for something special. - F2P (doesn't matter to me, but it's nice to try for free if you're not sure about it). - Buy, craft and dye clothes and use them over your regular armor on cosmetic slots. You can even paint and customize your car, bike, etc. - Active, nice and helpful GMs; 24/7 on chat. - A LOT OF DANCE MOVES, including MJ and the awesome Carlton Banks dance (Alfonso to his close friends). - A LOT of creative skills that you don't see everyday.  - Welcoming and active community (don't let the Steam numbers fool you, cause the most people playing it are using the non-Steam client).  - Deep and beautiful scenarios. - Scary voiceover (turn it off, man). - You have a flashlight. - Immersion feel on every step you take. - Level up takes a long long time, giving you some sense of importance in the world. - Awesome PvP. - You can fight while riding or driving! Man, EVERY SINGLE MMO should have this. Drive fast while unloading a submachinegun clip on a pursuit, why not? Not a Fast &amp; Furious type? You can do the cowboy Texas style aswell and shoot you Colt Anaconda on the horseback. - You can have a dog! (anyone remember Dogmeat from Fallout 2?) - Different paces of walking/driving/riding. You can walk, jog or run and drive/ride at speed as you like. Not so fast, no so slow, the way you want.  CONS: - One thing I dislike in this game is it's name. Should be called Awesome Earth. - Performance issues on some PCs. - 'Dated' graphics (I've player UO for 11 years, ask me if I give a dame for graphics?!) - 'Hardcore', even not having a full loot system like Darkfall, Ultima Online and Mortal Online (love them all). What makes this game 'hardcore' for some users is the fact that you need build and plan your character very carefully or it could be useless or disapointing at some point. - Unfriendly interface and learning curve.'  I agree 100% with him however ask me if I give a crud about graphics and I'll say no because I have been playing on a crappy pc with graphics as low as possible4 unlike him playing UO for 11 years [good game tho]. I definitaly recomend this game. It's the only game I am willing to spend real money on other then GTAV
6476	0	a	Remove the verification that's what makes so much people hate your game so yea I deam it un-playable
9185	1	a	The game could've been better, reinstalling because it used to be good and I reset computer from viruses...
9187	1	a	This is as badass as it gets. Think of it as Fallout: New Vegas: The MMO, except that you get horses, ATVS, motorcycles, choppers, dune buggies, cars and even a mutant wolf to ride, every gun being craftable and rewarded via PvP and quests, major focus in world pvp aswell as competitive PvP arenas, and oh so much more. I have never seen such a fun to work with, and easy to use crafting system in any other MMO. It is easy to grab the materials you need, level it up, and build the next gun, sword, motorcycle, or armor with. This game will keep you entertained FOREVER. There are no seperate servers, but rather just one big one, so you will always have players at your side and truly have that 'MMO' feel all while not fighting over drops that NPCs give and the such. This is also one of few games that traveling far distances is actually enjoyable in. This game is absolutely HUGE and literally takes hours and hours to cross an entire region. I wish I could write more, but this is just gold.
6484	0	a	The only part of this game that met my expectations was the uninstall button. I didn't think all of the negative reviews could possibly be true, considering how cool the ideas sounded on paper. And then I played it. Every facet of this game could've been accomplished better in a few weeks by any other studio. I, with no experience, could've designed a better looking UI. The gunplay is utterly terrible. The graphics are severly outdated, even by 2011's standards. The community is hostile. I didn't even get far enough in to mess with the customizable vehicles. Do yourself a favor and just get Borderlands instead.
6485	0	a	Well i played this game like 3 years ago, everything was so cool back then. After a while me and my buddy reached end game, joined clans blah blah, game suddenly became less enjoyable not because of bugs, glitches, but the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ness of GMs. I had so many play hours in this game, but the game never changes. And the Gms + Support never care for players, all they care is money. If you really want to play this game, think again.
6486	0	a	I honestly don't know how I feel about this game. My biggest problem with this game would have to go to how the map loads. I run on a decent laptop, and at the lowest settings, I get a constant 25-35 FPS. But occasionally, the game will become Microsoft Powerpoint, going to an astounding   1 FPS every five seconds for up to two minutes  . Aside from the horrid optomization, the textures could use a bit of work, to say the least. Even on high, textures are stretched to their limits to cover the large map. As well as that, there's no clear indication as to where a zone ends and another one begins besides a bit of text in the middle of the screen, and the variety is lacking in most respects. Off of the bad and onto the good, the game   is not   P2W. If it were, I wouldn't have 13+ hours in it. There is quite a bit of game to the game, and the purchases are   ONLY   meant for those who wish to support the team behind the game. I also love how this doesn't really even feel like a bulk-standard MMO with the TP/FP combat system. Though spells, called 'Mutations' here, are almost essentially useless, at least from what I've played up to level 7. If the devs put a bit more effort into the optomization and texture work in the game, that'd be nice. Just saying. I still do quite enjoy this game however, no matter how many times the framerate gets me killed because it had a presentation at work to do. I have no clue why, but the game is addicting, I will give it that. But please,   please   don't take mine or everybody elses' opinions on the game, try it for yourself. Depending on your tastes, you may or may not be surprised.   --- EDIT AS OF 6/23/15 ---   Heed thy warning, wary traveler, this game is dead. Dead in the sense that the devs themselves are neglecting it in it's entirety. I understand patches generally aren't a thing that can be pushed out very quick, unless they're small, but we haven't gotten a patch of substance for a LONG while. Long story short, the game isn't being actively fixed, the community is slowly declining, and the gameplay can be attrociously confusing. I do not reccomend unless you are dying to find an MMO in this vein. Even then, there are probably hundreds more of better quality out there.
9189	1	a	In first hour this game was worst for me, but after 1-2 hours i was addicted to it :D
9191	1	a	the one good thing about it not being high quality is that its not very laggy
9193	1	a	It takes a while to update, but it's worth every second of waiting.
6489	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS...I CANNOT LOG IN!!  THEN IM SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS
6490	0	a	Well I spawned in and the game was so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing glitchy that I couldn't out of the starting zone. Also the UI looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6491	0	a	- Development start date: 2006 Reloaded Studios. - Original release date: September 22, 2009 by Icarus Studios/Reloaded Studios. - Acquired by GamersFirst/Reloaded Studios June 15, 2011.  Pros: - Neat vehicles and pretty decent game mechanics.  Cons: - Content updates minimal since its release (patches somewhat regular but mostly just tweaks). - Outside game wiki nearly mandatory to make any progress.  I spent 2 months as a premium member for bonuses to crafting and leveling. But unfortunately I felt that decent game mechanics where hindered by incomplete or sparse content. Overall the game seemed very empty and bare boned. Monsters, weapons and gear felt repetitive and minimal. The original development team left many unfulfilled promises before abandoning this game to 'GamersFirst'. Last I played, a small community of players were still around and a GM or 2 were somewhat active.  As a fan of the post-apocalyptic theme and MMOs this game was a giant tease that left me wishing for more content and optimization. Stuff that simply never came.
9195	1	a	OK, it seems to me a lot of people have negative things to say about this game. I personally love this game, I cant stop playing. I think what happens a lot of the time is people start playing the game and dont realize just how immense this game is. They get like a whole 0.5% of the game played and dont understand it, and quit out of frustration. This game isnt the prettiest, and it does have its share of bugs. But, I expect games this immersive to have bugs, and I'm more about gameplay and less about graphics. If youre looking for a great MMORPG game this is it. The skill builds actually make sense, not like most games that give you the ability to max out all skills, this game makes you choose a specific build set to your play style. The crafting system is rich and really what i love about the game, Im always striving for better gear.   My advice. If you love crafting, skill building, tedious looting(i did say TEDIOUS) this is a great game. Play it. If you're not willing to atleast put 30-40 hours into the game before you make a decision on it, dont play it. This is a game for people of patience.  ALSO, for a free to play game, its still very possible to advance in the game and play it to the near fullest, unlike a lot of other free to play games.
9197	1	a	Ok this is a good game by the looks its like fallout just with worst grafics and difrent stroy. WARNING: Theres alout of downloading! I really think I should of got this when it came out. Peace.
9199	1	a	This game is amazing, lots of crafting, lots of pvp, tons of customization. To me it's one of the exceptions that is not a pay-to-win game
6496	0	a	Worst game ever 2014  Wouldneverplayagain/10
6497	0	a	This game is difficult to tolerate. The clunky control scheme, messed up graphics, and buggy environments ruin any redeeming velue that might exist.
6498	0	a	Horrible game. The interface is clumsy and unintuative, even with customization. The graphics are sub-par, and hardly anything in the game can be interacted with, even though there are what appear to be useful items strewn about. Don't waste your time with this one.
9201	1	a	love this game, couldn't stop playing it at all. I loved all those missions that contained collecting stuff or killing enimies, even delivering stuff to another city which took fuel or food, (if you were on a horse). really love the leveling up system, nut what I really didn't like (that was the only thing) which was the auction house. The aution house was all about players that would pay to get their chips (the currency of the game) which was a whole lot for like a stupid item that everybody had already, and even the crafting material was expensive in the aution hause, but like I said that was the only thing that bothered me. Everybody should get this game so that we can all play together.
9203	1	a	Yes Its its a ummmmmm ya get it
9205	1	a	Best first person/ third person mmorpg action pact awesomeness that you will find on the net. Pvp game play is real fun and the crafting system is one of the most complex i have ever seen check it out.
6501	0	a	It has all the classic elements of a crappy RPG like:   a hassle-filled control scheme  A boring overused plot  forcing you to sign up for their spam emails just to play  cookie-cutter character foils  Poor voice acting  Even worse sound effects (as in literally 0 noise, even when using a machine gun)   enemies who respawn way too fast (as in right after you already kill them)  and a story that goes absolutely nowhere.  2/10 Better off on Runescape m8
9207	1	a	The title has nothing to do with the earth falling through space.  10/10
9209	1	a	This game was fun but far too slow for me to really get into a lot I gave it a bit of time but the progression was just way too slow for me I felt as if I was playing WoW and the tutorial system was just as bad as WoW's when I tried this game though even with that all being said the game looked great and it showed a lot of promise.   While this type of game isnt for some people myself included I would still recommend it just for the fact that the game itself doesnt feel lieks ome kind of horrible ten minute made on a low budget game. The quality of this game is amazing and the simple fact that its free makes it all that much better I don't understand why so many people have a mixed view of this game but I am sure its in part to the fact that the community wasnt very nice to new players.
9211	1	a	Lots of similarities to WOW. Games is F2P, but if you buy a subscription you can craft items faster and you can buy stuff from their site. Apparently you also get points to use every month even if you never pay.  Game has an interesting story line, post-apocalyptic, with a very large map. Community and clans seem very nice and I was invited to join a clan quite early and even when clan players aren't available there are enough people playing that you can temporarily team up with someone to finish a quest.  Crafting list is immense with 9 or 10 categories and loads of items in each category.  Melee &amp; ranged combat pretty balanced.  Definietly having fun so far.
9213	1	a	Game is addictive, and community is excelent!
9215	1	a	Come Play Fallen Earth I used to play WoW, then I grew up.. Melee is a good way to find me shooting you in the face! If you love to craft and build a character then Fallen EArth is for you. Lastly this is a ! sever game so no hiding, active GM at alll times. Exellent Community of gamers also. Come get some I freaking Dare ya! Edit : No active GMs, game is very much alive, still a vast world to explore. This game requires a high intelligence, reading, thinking and a high amount of patience. Free too play not Play to win and that is always a plus!
9217	1	a	p2w much, but overall a fun game, especially if you join a guild lots of farming, pvp, 7\10
9219	1	a	Not too bad of a game.
9221	1	a	There is MUCH potential to where this could head to. I see it happening as well.. Deserves for you gamers to give it a try for sure!
6507	0	a	Very freaking bad video card wise and ill tell you how it completely crashed my PC that's how!!!
9223	1	a	Coolest Post-Apocalyptic Game,Even If The Only, Game I Have Ever Played. 9.7/10
9225	1	a	Fun game, good time waster for free.
9227	1	a	i like it.theres crafting looting and alot of other kool mechanics
6509	0	a	Can't update with a 12mb/s. Very afraid about this, i play this game few years ago and it was a good game..
9229	1	a	this game is amazing it is really fun to play with friends or solo.The map is big so you wont get bored of your suroundings and there are always missions to do .The combat engine is realy good and it runs smoothly(even a laptop can run it)i would highly recommend this awesome game:D
9231	1	a	I dont know if people still play this game via steam.but,i do play this game every time every day in my life this is the best rpgo game ever in the world,more than any other games...its should get to top 10 most popular f2p !!
9233	1	a	this game is so addicting
9235	1	a	Uninstall button works... So that's a plus.  Seriously though, was this made in 1991? Warcraft 2: Orcs and Humans had better graphics and combat mechanics.  No shooting sounds, no walking sounds, barely any sound at all...
6513	0	a	Um no thanks, not my style of game, very standard mmo, fallout feels, gameplay sucked and way to many skill butttons for my liking.
9237	1	a	World of Warcraft with a Fallout 3 texture pack.
9239	1	a	poor graphics, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. much better
9241	1	a	Great game. Fair for F2P Graphics - meh  
9243	1	a	The game is great when you play with friends. Me and my buddy's never play the game alone. As soon as we where all home from school/work ect we would play. Goof game when you are with friends
9245	1	a	Good apocalyptic feel hunter gatherer exploring crafting and stuff, good times. combat is easy and good. haha. Simple stories but nice. Relaxing rides on my hourse I call Tumble Weed. No presure to buy anything and no need for it. Only buy something like some extra goodies like an outfit etc... if you want to support the game. And it runs nice no problems here.
9247	1	a	Great game, crafters heaven, bit old looking but it is a bit old. There's plenty to do fun to make your character look like a bad@$$. The faction system feels so good and make you feel like you have control over what you do as you allign yourself with people of similar morals.The only big downfall to this game is the lack of player base and the small team working on it, if this game got more attention it would turn into something great. I really hope this game grows!
6520	0	a	What kind of game has all sounds but random yelling off by default?
9249	1	a	I like the post-apoctliptic style
9251	1	a	This game is very good and I played it alot with my brother. the only bad thing is getting a vehicle is hard and the people in chat are not helpful at all. over all I would give this game an 8/10. pretty good game. Check It Out!
9253	1	a	nice and long all is good  
6522	0	a	this game has alot going for it. it has good weapon design, a good character creation system, and a great concept but what this game suffers from the most is its bad controls and terrible combat system and the game really suffers from that, its difficult to get immersed when the controls are constantly working against you, but other than that its not 'too' bad and if you dont mind poor controls and iffy combat then id recommend it
6523	0	a	Wasting time simulator ;D
6524	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. It is ugly, and has horrible gameplay.
9255	1	a	I love crafting systems. Man, do I ever love good crafting systems in game. And what better then a game about the post apocolyse to really shine in this department? There is nothing quite as rewarding as savaging through mounds of garbage, collecting various long rusted do-dads, and long forgotten whats-its to make various deadly weapons to gut, barrage, or otherwise eviscerate various pus drooling mutants.  Okay, so the crafting is still varily limited. But compared to most MMORPGS it is still rather 'up there' on the scale of awesome. Combine that with real time FPS combat (which still boils down to a-typical pulling and grinding, admitably) and you got yourself some fun times.  The game is rather graphic intensive, but after kicking the graphics down even my laptop with it's outdated drivers and such was capable of running it releatively smoothly. Grab a friend, get your horse and hit the waste! It's time to launch your career as a down and dirty, gun toting scavager!
9257	1	a	pretty badass if you ask me 
6526	0	a	It is a great game that makes the aftermat of the apocalypse seem enjoyable with your friends and other people online. This game is great on the RPG side as well as the fact that its free to play is really a good spot for those who just wants to play games without no strings attached.  BUUUUUT the gtame is dead so yeah....I wish people would've seen this game when it was in its early days...it was like the poor man's Fallout 3...Because is was FREE
9259	1	a	IGN gave it a 8.1/10  I give it a 666/10
9261	1	a	If you are a person who likes big open world games where you can do whatever you want, then I reccomend this game to you. After the little introduction to the game you begin on your journey to do whatever you please, like to become a bandit and steal from people or to be someone who collects medicine to get money and such. I really like this game and can be fun in group play or a little chillax type game. There are some problems with the game and the owners don't seem to update/change much anymore but hey, its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing free big open world map where you can do whatever the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you want.
6527	0	a	it definetly isnt a fallout game nor dayz but it's fun the pvp isnt really 'good' as you would say the weapon's literaly are nerfed alot since the last time i played and i didnt alpy it alot but i mean yeah it's a open wor;d apocalypse game but the pvp isnt worth downloading this for.
9263	1	a	I just started this game today.I'm not going to lie game took forever to download:(, but after it was done I opened it and it crashed.I didnt really mind because I have a poor quality laptop, then I played it and enjoyed it and i'm still only doing missions for one person with 2 hours.Yea I said 2 HOURS so that proves how much enjoyment this game gives.
9265	1	a	A very amazing game been playing the heck out of it past few days.Feels like fallout but with a way bigger customization for character gear and you get awsome vehicles and mounts just so amazing so many options. 8/10
9267	1	a	honestly I liked this game more than anything in the form of textures and gameplay so I recommend this game to everyone who wants online and open world games
6531	0	a	i can't get in the actual game so i dont recomend it so much
9269	1	a	This game is awesome! Ride your hourse or your bike from town to town, looting for food and item and then buy some food or fuel to continue your journey, this game is so reality and I love it! people in here are nice, but there is some guys look like a scammer, always ask for your Steam Profile Number, don't share your info to ANYONE !!  Just try it ! And don't compare this game with fallout, they are different! just try it and you will see ! 10/10  
9271	1	a	This game sucked and its not worth downloading nor playing.
6533	0	a	Crafting, the game. Be prepare to spend hours upon hours of gathering materials to make your own equipment. The story is moot, and the game in incredibly newbie unfriendly.  Be prepared to learn how to do things on your own.
6534	0	a	Game is ALDI
9273	1	a	It's a great game, and requires a lot of teamwork in the late-game. But unfortunantly after it went F2P the flood of CoD 10yr olds came and destroyed it, just like every other F2P game. I love this game and will stick by my decision to thumb up it even after the disaster we might call Jarod Fogel's Basement has happened.   Now then on to the actual review.  Pros -  Introcate crafting system, it takes time and rewards patiences.  Talent system, Extremely confusing at first, but with help you can master it and create the ultimate player.  All in one style of gameplay, You are able to meld your character as you see fit, make him a Melee, or Gunslinging Dual Pistols, or even a high powered rifle.  Helpful Community, (Please keep in mind this used to be at all levels, but has receeded up into the extremely late-game due to 10yr old activites) Many players that I have met throughout my gameplay have actually given me the shirt off their back. That's right... Literally.  Cons -  10yr olds... 10yr olds EVERYWHERE!...  Minor glitches with mob pathing  Headshots don't register EVERY headshot.  And other than that I got nothing... Oh did I mention the 10yr olds swarming everywhere but the gang territories?
6535	0	a	This game is so lagging i cant play it. It just crashes everytime i walk. Game gods FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!
9275	1	a	amazing i love it but everytime i go to change the graphics and restart i goes all grey and i cant play
9277	1	a	HEY is alright
6540	0	a	You Can't Even Log In To The Game For The First Time.. How Could You Play??  -11/10 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥er
9279	1	a	The game is great when you play with friends. Me and my buddy's never play the game alone. As soon as we where all home from school/work ect we would play. Goof game when you are with friends
6541	0	a	It's an ok game but it gets boring and repetitive quite quickly :/
9281	1	a	Got killed by a crab that had a computer monitor as its shell.   10/10
6542	0	a	Crafting, the game. Be prepare to spend hours upon hours of gathering materials to make your own equipment. The story is moot, and the game in incredibly newbie unfriendly.  Be prepared to learn how to do things on your own.
6543	0	a	well mixed views on this game, it's ambitous,but is still buggy, i enjoyed this game to start with, the wide crafting options often leave you daunted. but it's the crafting which makes this game great, mobs don't drop gear, they drop crafting mats...in fact crafting mats are everywhere,so if you want to roam the wasteland with an uber gun at low levels..then go play fallout3/new vegas, cos it aint gonna happen...unless you buy from the cash shop or have a rich friend in game, you wont get any real decent automatic weapons till lvl 10-15.....'lvl 10-15 you say?' yea...it'll take a while to get to lvl 10..and then you need to craft it...not as easy at it sounds,but there is always the auction house for your overpriced guns and gear. oh and pvp is so bloody broken on this game it's not even worth going into, lack of endgame/expansion content means once you are lvl 40+ this game gets old and boring real fast, not that you'll ever reach lvl 40+ , you'll get bored and decide to play new vegas by lvl 20.
9283	1	a	I mean, if you've always wanted to play Fallout but never could for whatever reason, then this game is not really like it. Though it is enjoyable.  7/James Franco
9285	1	a	Great F2P Game!!
6544	0	a	Encouraged by friend to try it out I installed Fallen Earth and I was prepared for some fun. Sure, this game is kind of fun - there is so much to do, plenty of quest, etc. but for some reason it didn't made me stay for longer than few hours. Maybe it's because I prefer MMO games in fantasy setting than post apocalyptic. Maybe one day I will be back and give it another chance but for now I say nope. It's free to play game so go ahead and try it yourself, maybe you spend more time playing Fallen Earth than I did.
9287	1	a	Post apocalyptic MMO. Great concept. Could use more work but the price is right. Crafting, lots to explore, lots of character progression options.
9289	1	a	Come Play Fallen Earth I used to play WoW, then I grew up.. Melee is a good way to find me shooting you in the face! If you love to craft and build a character then Fallen EArth is for you.

6545	0	a	IT'S PAY TO WIN!
9291	1	a	Great F2P Game!!
9293	1	a	This game is awesome! You get to craft items... don't want to ruin the surprise of what though.You complete quests all while trying to figure out your past!   *Update* I have begun playing this game again. While G1 did destroy some great elements of the game. This is still one heck of a game. I'm not one of those people who played this game for the PvP, I was one of those people playing by myself for the story and mainly just because I stunk at PvP :p The population of the game has died off tremendously, but the people in-game are helpful and kind. It's still a game to consider for a couple of pointless, fun hours. Heck, at the very least, download it. It's free, nothing to lose.
6547	0	a	Super Lag, Not much point. Stick to Fallout.
6548	0	a	To be honest you could tell they were trying to meke this game exactly like Fallout NV or 3 but its whatever. The controls seem a little slow and unresponsive. The quests do seem fun but don't really have much taste.  
6549	0	a	Free and waste of anyones time
6550	0	a	nope, just nope, if you wanna use guns prepare to be completely broke throughout
9295	1	a	this game is fun for a while however after you start to get far // the second map you need to pay to have a bigger poket for money and i lost lots of money due to this fact and now you need to pay to get more money making this game allmost no fun in the end.
9297	1	a	I love this game! You scavenge, harvest, craft everything yourself. If you like post apocalyptic games. this is for you. Please dont think that all you do is shoot Zombies.. as it is not that kind of setting. The world was ruined by biochemical weapons and radiation. But if you want a fun free to play game, then come join the rest of the community!!
9299	1	a	Great game! (7/10) Controls are a bit confusing...
9301	1	a	I like the game, but my tutorial glitched and I can no longer do anything :/ so I might set this one aside for a while

9303	1	a	IGN gave it a 8.1/10  I give it a 666/10
6554	0	a	This game seems to be good. It has some nice features that combine more traditional MMORPGs with things usually found only in singleplayer games. However, there is one major problem: LAG! Shooting is, while seemingly well-designed, virtually impossible outside of spray-and-pray. Melee faces similar issues, but is at least feasible. In other words - good game, but it requires too powerful of a computer for the level of graphics and ai complexity it offers. If you have a powerful computer, I recommend it. If not, then don't waste time trying to deal with the lag.
9305	1	a	I love crafting systems. Man, do I ever love good crafting systems in game. And what better then a game about the post apocolyse to really shine in this department?

9307	1	a	Ok so, where do I start? This game was a game I was very fond of (As my time spent playing it might show) and I've already written a review before but since it was kinda choppy I stepped upon it again and decided to add to it.  I've been playing this game for around 4 years back when I started around 2012 when I was also first introduced to steam, so along with downloading TF2 this game caught my eye as my love of post-apoc settings for games sparked my intrigue. Back then, this game just had so much to offer, to me in particular as I was fine with discovering most of it for myself with managing to obtain an ATV early on.   In terms of gameplay, the whole grinding aspect didn't really bother much as I was still managing to have fun cooperating with various people I would meet around placed like Embry (I think that was the name of the main S1 city?) and City where there was an event to protect a town made up by players from enemy mobs (Called Shivas If I'm correct) where you would see people showing off their cool gear and mounts.  The PvP aspect of the game was never really anything I tapped into, It just didnt really intrest me, but I'm sure theres some players out their who saw its potential.  To end this review of, no matter how bad it is, I guess this game is kinda dead with its peak being off in the earlier years where I made a few friends on my way to Lvl 55.  If anyone remembers me, my main characters name was Brad Carson, with other names like Pvt.Brad being another char of my mine, and to anyone who remembered me, It was a pleasure having played a fun game with you for quite a few years.   Sorry if this review was pretty bad, I'm just really getting over a lot.
9309	1	a	I &lt;3 you G1. And this game is rather monotonous. Still nice though. Instead of sleeping pills or such. Works.
9311	1	a	Yeah its pretty cool, don't play it much now.
9313	1	a	Game is addictive, and community is excelent!
9315	1	a	It is a good game.
9317	1	a	(read it all) im uninstalling the game because i dont like nintendo 64 grahpics but its good aiming system nice wide area a wellthought out game and i played a chick without pants that whole time LOL tan lines OP
9319	1	a	This is a sandbox game of sorts with the elements of games such as DayZ,Fallout and Rust.However,since it lacks the visual beauty of DayZ and the back story of games such as Nether and Fallout,it is not quite as popular as one might hope. The game still requires some tweeks here and there but with patience and some tlc,this game has extreme potential. The depth of crafting and exploring is truly unique along with the optional co-operation of other players. It's been quite awhile since I last played this game but I believe it deserves a second chance from those who shun it due to graphics and any slight game play bugs. All in all?Give it a chance.
6559	0	a	This game involves alot of boaring walking and seems like a bad fallout 3/NV multiplayer
9321	1	a	Fun, little funny. But you know, its an everyday thing to get ate by a mutant chicken right?

9325	1	a	Amazing game just had to uninstall because was unable to get dlc content
9327	1	a	Fun game I recommend it because it will keep you busy for hours and its like a poor mans Fallout
9329	1	a	Fallen earth put Fallout new vegas to shame !  Here You will get real factions, and real wasteland where you can lose youself into, here you'll have to survive against terrible odds! Here you'll taste BLOOD ! So join now ! CHOTA !
9331	1	a	Good game play. Need to improve on stash and inventory.
9333	1	a	was one of the best MMO's out then the Devs gave up banned half the players GG game
9335	1	a	A great free to play MMO with an addictive chained quest progression through the first major areas (I've just reached the 'conflict towns' where factions can be chosen). Just riding a horse, or driving a buggy, through the post-apocalyptic wilderness is a strangely relaxing experience! At least until eaten by a sandworm!
9337	1	a	Simply the best free to play game on the market.  Think Fallout vs Madmax and you are pretty near what the games is... but in my opinion it's got more Fallout to the flavour than Madmax, espeically when you see the Brotherhood of Steel clan running around RPing.  The world is huge, the quests are fun, and the crafting is 2nd to none. Crafting which is the benchmark of any MMO to date. Everything, well 99% of items are player made.  Play 1st person or 3rd person, live combat with head shots that have to be aimed and a full and exotic levelling of your character. Just a huge onion where layer upon layer you open.  But the emptyness of the world is so relaxing and cathatric, where hugh swathers of the map are exactly what a wasteland should be. NPC areas are rich of people and often where you'll see people and the live chat is still active for the endless questions for the game as it's depth is not reached just with the tutorial.  It's often it's depth which is so alluring, with the game systems opening up by discover and with the levelling being so statisfying, the only question you'll need to answer is do you have a free hour of your life to test out the game. As with free to play, what's there to loose, and what a discover of a forgotten game you'll find.  A rare gem in the grass, not quite a polished diamond, but nonetheless priceless in a market full of carbon copy fantasy MMOs, buy to win games and games that are instantanced.   Fallen earth is fully open world with no loading, and for that, mega props to the dev team. My hat goes off to you.
9339	1	a	Ive played this years ago when it first came out. I was kind of unimpressed with the beginning area where you have to fight your way outside, but once in the outer region, it was very neat.. Lots of quests to do, crafting is good, the economy in game was good.. ie putting things on the broker, and I did the questline where you can craft a atv i think it was and then motorbikes and cars. This game is definatly worth playing, altho like I said the first 10 minutes of it will make you wonder. Just hang in there ! I'm going to do a reinstall, myself.
9341	1	a	Not a bad MMO for its age, its lowish graphics make it easily runnable on even the worst of potatoes. along with the crafting system being rather well done in my own opinion.
9343	1	a	It suck serious â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
6569	0	a	This game was great! and then Kabam it's gone..
6570	0	a	3 words Screw you Kabam
6571	0	a	I used to play this game a  far  long time ago, back on Kongregate. It was a good game, plenty of fun to be had, and the perma-death, while annoying, only made me more determined to do better in the future, work with my friends, and pursue a higher goal.  But that was a different time entirely; a golden age long since past.  So, around 2 years later, being a more experienced and wisened individual, I decided to check this game out again, seeing it was on Steam. I went into the reviews, and noticed...a surprising negative reaction among a bulk of the players, even ones who've spent over hundreds of hours. I thought to myself,  Well it just can't be as bad as these people say, right? People love to use hyperbole to make a point.  In my lack of judgement, I decided to play this again...  I regretted said decision.  [GETTING STARTED]  So I started up the game after a shockingly-fast install time of roughly 2 seconds. Flash games, gotta love'em. I start things up, go into my character menu, and realize that half the screen's dedicated to selling me crap. That's  not  a good sign...  I start up my one character slot, and I go through the motions of picking my first hero, a Warrior. The tutorial's straight-forward, I blitzed through fairly quickly, and reached the point where I named the account. For review sake, I'll disclose my account username in-game was DMNTDxNem.  [MY EXPERIENCE]  When I first started up my warrior, in the first server I selected, things went overall decently for me. I stuck to the beach, like the game said to, and leveled up to 3 before taking on a little deeper in the forest areas. Reaching around level 5 now, fighting against not only the enemies, but the server lag, I decide a quick respite at the Nexus was in order.  Now, from when I was playing this back on Kongregate, I used to  love  the Nexus! It was crowded pretty often, yeah, but there tended to be a lot of friendly player interaction; people helping each other, constantly working in each other's benefit to get better gear and equipment, there was always strong community there.  But on my return trip to the Nexus during this refresher playthrough, I realized the game's first critical issue:  Bots! Bots everywhere! I couldn't speak to any of the players, as few as there even were around, without bots running up and drowning us out. I cannot tell you how much I desperately wanted to kill some of these players; physically. In real life. I was that angry.  Aside from that, though, there was also the issue of the shop items. Originally, pre-dev change, the shop items, while difficult to acquire, were completely do-able, and it was rather straight-forward; you earn coins, you go to the shop, you spend coins on an item you want (and eventually die and lose, but I digress,) and you got said item. Now, shop items range from the hundreds to the thousands in coin value! And if you came back into the game with 50 coins earned, many of the shop items that were once 50 are now  51 , meaning you'd be forced to pay for one more bloody coin! Slowly, I was realizing that people's anger was rather justified.  Enough about the Nexus and the broken shop, though. I went back in, enjoyed my time fighting through enemy territory, until it appeared the server I was on had a server-wide boss battle occurring. Everyone was teleported into a dangerous, high-level world dungeon: Oryx's Castle. I, among many players, was ill-equipped for the encounter, so I ended up dying along heaps of other players, who all probably experienced the same game-breaking lag spikes that I did. Congratulations, RotMD, you, a flash game, made my high-performance gaming computer buckle onto its knees...  Second go, another warrior, and I was definitely getting the hang of things. I beat a few dungeon bosses, went into the ruins and killed a few mini-bosses strewn across the world, and grabbed some decent equipment. Things were going good, and the whole thing went just as I'd hoped. Barring the several passing exchanges I gave the bots advertising their crummy products, to which I had some choice opinions of them, I finally came across an actual, breathing player; they were running around like the flash, and when I strolled up, they told me about a dungeon where they could help me get some better equipment. Now, I'll say in advance that I read the reviews extensively, and knew there were players who got their kicks off of getting people with good characters killed. I thought to myself,  Well, my guy's crap, so he'd be wasting his time if he just wanted to off me.   How wrong I was.  First off, the dungeon he dragged me into was from some candy dude that was prancing around like the Gingerbread Man. I insisted on being the one to take him down, so a little Looney Tunes-style chase went on, me using mana potions to keep up like Lance Armstrong used drugs for the Tour De France, and finally was able to dead him to death. Me and the guy go in, and before my eyes, he vanishes through a wall...and when he returned, every enemy he could alert in the area was with him. Running as far as I could, not long, considering I used up all my mana, I was eventually shot to death by a unicorn pinata barfing rainbows. And so, at level 9, Sir Gullible II was found dead due to overdose on vibrant colors. The last words he ever heard were from his once-thought ally, typing in '#rekt' about 7 times. Fun times were had..  [GAMEPLAY]  Now, the fact the game now being a botting trollfest of epic proportions notwithstanding, it's still incredibly functional. The base game works as intended, and the system hasn't changed all that much since 2 years ago. Now, I'll admit the difficulty curve's definitely become harder to cope with, especially how the higher-tier equipment is even harder to acquire than ever before, unless you throw your wallet at the screen, but by the by, it hasn't really changed all that much. You still work with other players, you still try for the best loot, and you still fight towards the ultimate goal of taking down the Mad God.  You have your four slots, weapon, helmet, armor, and ring, and equipment is divided amongst different classes, rings being the only ones where any class can use anything they find for that slot. Each class has different advantages and disadvantages; warriors can buff allies and face-tank, wizards can do solid damage, archers can hit multiple enemies at once, they're all viable for different reasons.  Remember, of course, about the perma-death mechanic; once a character's dead, they're dead. Anything they had, if you didn't get it sorted out or saved, is gone, so it's incredibly important to manage the equipment that you find, so that the next time someone throws a death-spewing unicorn at you, you'll have plenty of equipment for the next character that hits the ground.  [SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS]  In all, the game's as it's always been: you play, you die, you improve, you die again, the cycle continues. Granted, there are the more-than-occasional hacking players that either screw you out of loot, or, in my experience, send sentient pinatas to murder you with rainbows, so the cycle is a bit less off a circle, and more of a triangle, where every corner is a slap to the face. You get your first slap when you boot up the game, and you're being asked to buy crap you don't even need; you get the second slap going to the Nexus, once a sanctum for player cooperation, now a den of botting inequity and a broken economy; and the final slap, rounding this merry-go-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-yourself out quite nicely, is the afore-mentioned hackers, honing their trolling skills to a weaponized level in the goal of  wanting you dead.   I could go on about how Kabam doesn't care, and how they potentially ruined a good game. But, instead, I'll give them a break, and say this: at least Road-Squared didn't get their hands on this game.
6572	0	a	Hoo, this game. Was a lot of fun for the first 60 hours...before the company got bought out by a bigger company. Apparently that company had big ideas in terms of monetizing the hell out of this fairly enjoyable free to play game. I enjoyed it back when it was catching on, but I think the game has definitely taken a turn for the worse when it got bought out. The design is more focused towards getting your money than making the game more enjoyable. When a game does that, even if I already invested 60 hours, I walk away rather than get treated like a bag of money by the game's designers and publishers.
6573	0	a	Micro-transactions became too dominant in the game's design and it's suffered greatly for it. Used to be a lot of fun, though.
6574	0	a	Before you say I have no experience with this game, I have played for a good few hundred hours on the browser version.  This game USED to be good. It really was. Back then, a company called Wildshadow owned the game. It was truly f2p, with skill and no money required.  Then, a company called Kabam took over. They changed the game into a cashgrab. Skins? Buy gold. Vaults and characters? Buy gold. 1-life weapons or keys? Buy gold. Everything is gold gold gold. Updates are rare, and even when they come they just add more items to be purchased with gold. In fact, the way they 'celebrate' holidays is by creating cheap weapon reskins for more people to buy with.. you guessed it, gold!!  You might be thinking, at least there's player interaction! No, there isn't. The game is infested with hackers, scammers, enemy draggers, spambots, etc. Kabam doesn't care at all. After all, you don't make any money from clearing away hackers, so why bother?  TL;DR: Stay away.
6575	0	a	It was really fun until Kabam ruined it.
6576	0	a	Very dissapointed.. played the game like a year ago.. bought char slots, chests &amp; leveled/geared/unlocked several chars back then.. was really fun  now I see, that the game got some updates and I was getting excited again until i logged in: All chars/bought chests+bought char slots are resetted/removed again (I'd really like to know how they can remove something I actually paid money for?) and of course all chars are resetted... all I saw was a very big pop-up about a pundle that inlcluded char slots/chests etc (kinda all the things I already bought 1 year ago already).. so yeah.. greed took over here.. stay away.. rotmg RIP..
6577	0	a	Alright. This game. I used to play it on its website, but I downloaded it on here to review it.  Realm of the Mad God used to be one of the games I played the most. However, when the company Kabam bought it, it instantly became a store. Kabam are just greedy, money grabbing rip-offs, and they are the exact reason I have stopped playing this game. The main lobby is just a store, showing off weapons, armor, pets, and other things that can only be bought with coins, which can be bought with real money, or can be earned from dieing with a decent to good character who needs good stats to actually earn the coins. Feel free to play this game, but prepare your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for micro-transactions and updates that only benifit people who love to spend money.
6578	0	a	i love this game, i used to play it when my other game is updatig, it was fun  until Kabam ruined it

6591	0	a	RotMG is a game where your credit card is the best weapon.
9347	1	a	Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a great game at certain times, but then you can feel like you have wasted too much time on it. Once you get to level 20 the game is going to give you a cookie, then kick you in the shins and take the cookie back. Generally speaking in a neutral point to review, this game will most likely pull you in once you put some time into it and you will grow to hate the game when you die, and then find it creeping back on your a few weeks/months later and have a sudden desire to play again. Once you die there is no way to recover your character or any of the items, which is the most frustrating part of the game. However, you can pay real money (which I'm not a fan of, but in no way would I consider this a pay-to-win game) to get more characters slots so that you can still have the other guys when you die. Play this game if you have a lot of extra time because it will pull you in fast.
6595	0	a	I played the browser version of this a lot. It was plenty fun, grinding pots with friends, maxing a char, dying, crying, vowing not to be overconfident again, then repeat. It would still be fun right now if Kabam actually puts their effort into balancing the classes and dungeons and all that, but noooo they only care about their sweet money. We haven't seen an update for months, and the game is overrun by hackers and bots. I wish I can see your glorious days again, my dear RotMG..
6596	0	a	I used to love this game, I played it everyday with my clan but then came the update that ruined the game. They turned the game into pay to win and then I just gave up on the game because you would have to spend hundreds of $ or Â£ or whatever your currency is just to have more fun in the game and when you bought the upgrades, most of them were terrible.
6597	0	a	This game was fun when it first came out, if you saw someone with good stuff, you know they had been through a lot of time and effort to get that stuff, now you just need a credit card. And the servers, so laggy and always full.  Back in the GOOD days of ROTMG it was a game where me and some friends could play it and enjoy it, no lag, no buying items, no bots, no annoying, selfish devs and the producers didn't only care about their income. I miss it.  Screw You Kabam, royaly and dearly,  Screw. You.
6598	0	a	It's pay to win. If you put real money into a character and it dies, you lose everything, due to perma-death.
6599	0	a	To quote a friend, 'I just get mad at that game. Everything costs money.' Basically, I came for the bullet hell action and left due to the absurd amount of money the developer wants to weasel out of you to keep you entertained for more than 10 minutes at a time. $60 for a 'starter pack' that contains barely anything? GTFO.
9349	1	a	#MakeThisGameGreatAgain #DecaGames I have played this game too much (just look at those hours wasted xd) but the possiblities of creation are almost unlimited, so I hope DecaGames will save this game (UTs tradable again pls ^^)
6605	0	a	I've been playing this game for years (even if not through Steam), and I can say that, through time, it has evolved to provide many unique and exciting features: - Severe game balancing issues! Land tons of damage with one class and steal loot from other poor useless players! - No serious updates in years! You can play the same dungeons again, and again and again! And then some more!  - Rampant cheating! And if this doesn't still sell this to you, also know that the company now managing the game, the infamous Kabam, totally ignores cheater reports! - Poisonous community! Scammers? We got those! Leechers? Of course, the game actually encourages leeching! Racial and homophobic insults? Goes without saying! - Pay to win!!! You think you can max your pet without spending real money? Think again!!! And if you don't feel like buying game gold, just check out the black market spambots that make the game chat window completely unusable! - Much, much more!
6606	0	a	I played this game when it was a browser game back in the days and damn what a good game. Thanks Kabam.
6607	0	a	Realm of the Mad God is a top down free to play MMO mouse aim shooter with a simple art style. It has been around for a few years as a Flash game. You start the game easy enough, by selecting from unlocked classes such as rogue, warrior, priest, archer and so on. Each class plays the same, you fire projectiles. Have a sword? You shoot projectiles. The only difference between the classes are the stats and the equipment they can use. You can unlock more classes when you reach certain levels with the base classes. Each enemy gives you some minimal experience and leveling up will only improve your stats. There are no new spells and no choice of improvement. It all feels very dull and too simple for a MMO.  The controls are like every other mouse aim shooter, arrows to move with mouse aim and click to shoot. You have a special ability and potions too, but for the most part you can just use your normal attacks. Speaking of the mouse aim, it feels very inaccurate. I can stand still, fire the projectile and the projectile will miss even when I shouldn't. Maybe there is an accuracy stat or something. It feels odd when enemies very accurate. Luckily you are quick enough to dodge projectiles. Again, maybe its a stat and I need to have better gear, but there is nothing on the equipment that shows accuracy, just range and attack power.  There are a lot of enemies, each with different stats and attack patterns. For the most part they have enemies simply shoot at you. Most have single shots, others have double and triple spreading shots. Still some fire a sort of 360 degree bullet shield preventing anything from getting close. The bosses aren't that different from normal enemies. They just have larger sprites with other creatures swarmed around them.  There are quests in the game, but I mean that in the vaguest sense of the word. All quests seem to be kill the big monster. No one tells you to. You just do it. The game points out the direction of the big monster when you enter the location.  The maps feel a bit jumbled randomly with trees and foliage with a path drawn through the map. It just feels like lazy or quick map design and not 'randomly generated.' Some enemies will drop portals to different areas which is a fun feature, but since the areas look just thrown together its always just another randomly thrown together area. You have a mini map that will reveal more as you explore, but if you leave an area and return, you need to explore it again to show it on your mini map. At any time out in the wilderness, you can instantly warp back to the town / nexus with the click of a button.   The locations might look like a jumbled mess, but the town / nexus looks great, but its all just a big store to sell you stuff. All of the stores have items visibly showing you everything so you need to walk over them instead of having an easy to use menu. Another problem is to see the stats of the item you need to hover your mouse over the 'buy it' button. Don't accidentally click that button though. You cannot sell equipment, so you're forced to drop it or trade it with other players, but for the most part the equipment feels useless when enemies drop it all. Plus players are kind enough to just give stuff for free since everything is so abundant.  Normal games would have you kill enemies for gold, but in Realm of the Mad God, you need to buy gold with real money of course. Everything is right there in town / nexus for you to buy after a brief tutorial area. What do you buy with gold? Name changes, more characters, armor, weapons, rings, boxes with random items, keys, pets, extra storage, building materials and everything. Did I mention that when you die you lose all progress and items? So if you spend real life money into a free game and you die, you've just lost everything. Do you need gold to have fun? No. The town / nexus has plenty of people selling gold via their website for real money and it floods the chat for some servers drowning out any real discussion.  This feels like a really dull game that is out for your money. Not just that, but it seems hastily thrown together. The quick simple art style, the slow grind for experience, the awful map design, no real quests, the laggy input, and the inaccurate aiming, all makes me not want to be in the game let alone buy anything in the game with real money.
6608	0	a	you cant realy do anything without paying a bunch of money to buy things... not a good game
6609	0	a	Hours of grinding , days of farming , weeks of potting , months trying to get the gear and pots , finally got my maxed 8/8 character. Died due to a lag spike FML 11/10 would do all this again  UPDATE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Kabam
6610	0	a	It's pretty sad to see such an awesome game go from free 2 play to pay 2 win. It costs 10 dollars just to change your character's name. If you can not stop yourself from buying game items that are good your character then DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Otherwise you may have decent fun.
6611	0	a	  Edit 25/06/2016: KABAM sold this game to a small indie company - They might bring new life into the game agian / If so ignore this review :)   Realm of the Mad God is a massively co-op action RPG created with an overused generic pixel art.   The game was decent at first, and i have put alot of hours and money into this game, but... It's all pay to win now.   It really seems fun when you start, but then you realize that the only reliable way to get good items is to pay Kabam or use 100 hours on a charecter trying to make it 6/8 and endning up dying because of server lag. You will last a few lives until you ragequit because of the completely unique yet really annoying perma-death mechanic, which only enforces the motivation to pay. Ofcause you can manage to play the game without paying anything and have fun, but it will seriously take you 300years to manage to get as far as someone who just put in 50$ on the game.   Don't waste your time or $ on this game, its a dying game and havnt been updated for a long time and probably wont get any updates in the near future.
9351	1	a	This weird pixel graphic action mmo dungeon crawler with rogue-like elements was created a long time ago by a small company called wildshadow. After years of awesomeness they had to sell it to kabam to keep the game going, kabam kept it going for some more years also, and now finally it's in the hands of Deca(Thankfully being revived by them after kabam's dark era). I've been with this game for so long i keep coming back to it, the 1000+ hours i have here are only with the steam account(had 2 older accounts before this one). I'm mentioning this so you get the idea that this game is very hard to kill, the people just wanna play this ****. If you're thinking about playing this game let me transfer some of my genuine info to you :). The game is extremely grind-based, so if you're not someone who likes to grind for endless hours everyday then this game should be a pass for you before i even go any further. Now for some pros and cons.  + Huge variety of enemies/bosses/events with unique variations of butt-clenching bullet hell patterns and tactics. + More than big enough player base( very active game) + Huge variety of items that adds to the already great replayabilty value of the game. + The game is based alot on team play and as mentioned above there's always people to play along with. + The game is being properly revived by Deca games and right now is the best time to start playing this game. (Month of the mad god, a special month, will run from 21 july till around the end of august).  - The community(Like most gaming communities) can be very toxic at times. Not as toxic as moba communities don't worry :) - Lag in this game can punish you extremely high as it is a perma-death game. You need to take caution from both server lag and your own internet lag as not to lose a month work in a second. If you have a decently stable internet connection you should be safe from a lag related death most of the time though. - Client users/Hacker/Dupers/Bots love to manifest this game; BUT Deca(unlike kabam) is already showing alot of promise in making this a thing of history(fingers crossed).  Conclusion: Definitely a strong recommendation from me, i absoloutely love this game, and you won't have to pay a dime to try it so you should definitely do that. 9/10
6614	0	a	fun, but some may not like the in game purchases 
6615	0	a	Seriously, Kabam? You just HAD to ruin an already perfect game. I get that paying to get certain perks helps out the devs, but don't make it so that you have to pay to advance. Screw you Kabam.
6616	0	a	It used to be a fun/addicting game, but it Kabaam (the company that bought out the game) is all about stuffing money into their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fat bloody pockets. It was so much more fun with non soulbounded items, no insanely high tier items in the store, and no stupid pets.    ----EDIT---- Updated Review as of 5/9/16 12:53 AM  So I decided to go ahead and play the game once again since I flew back home for my 1.5 weeklong summer vacation after college.   TL;DR:  The game is fun, but holy sh*t, the gold spammers got worse and there are minimal amounts of effort to update the game. So yeah, it's fun, go ahead and play it for a bit if your internet doesnt' suck. However, I still can't recommend this game because Kabaam continues to demonstrate a classic example of a company that buys out another company, providing a minimal amount of effort to make any improvements to the game (because, 'why make improvements when you can do nothing at all and still make money off of the 12 year olds that fall for this pay2win scheme?').  ------------------------------------------------------------------  The game has gone through a laughably minimal amount of updates since I had last played this game, over a year ago. For a 2D MMO with a lot of potential for interesting, frequent updates, I thought that perhaps some unique new gamemodes, some cool improvements to the hub world, and new classes would be released.    Did I see  any  of those changes in the game:   no, not really     What I discovered in my +25 hours of playing (while on vacation): 
9353	1	a	 Bullet-Hell RPG where the wrong step (or lag spike) could end your life
6619	0	a	Yep It was fun backthen when  Wild-Shadow-Studios Own the game and then kabam token over and ruined the game so now you have to buy everything like (coins, ect)
9355	1	a	Personally my favorite game but i will be unbias. Its a very fun and addicting game. It takes time to build up but once you get there its good til you die. The game is a game where you can die and lose that character for ever, so its best to play hard but safe.
9357	1	a	My progression as a player who has not spend a dime on this game: -&gt; Starting a new character -&gt; Levelling up to max level -&gt; Going godland farming -&gt; Struggling with inventory management because I have only 1 chest and 1 character to use -&gt; Manage to rebuild stats and items from recent death -&gt; Becoming overconfident -&gt; Dying to lag or a self-made mistake, which was made because overconfidence -&gt; Repeat  TL;DR: Remind yourself that  overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer   Jokes and complaining aside: I have had a great time while playing this game, give it at least a try, it's free to play anyways
6621	0	a	bad game dead developers  real playtime is atleast 1300 hours, as i played on flash projector.
6622	0	a	Pay to.......I'd say win but you don't even get that, pay for pixels with no relevance!!!
6623	0	a	I have 400 hours on the browser version as well. fk kabam and pets gg wp
6624	0	a	I've played this game since the beginning. You won't see that on my profile, because I played on the browser, until I recently went to check it out again. Big mistake.   All this game does is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off anymore, and not because I die over and over, that's part of the fun. What pisses me off is seeing a game I used to love being ruined and turned pay-to-win by Kabam. Kabam has done nothing but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game over completely since they bought it out. It's focused on how much money you can dump in the game, rather than how good you are, and how much time and effort you put in to FINDING your gear.   You used to have to hunt forever to get a good set, now you can just slap a few bucks down, and walk out of the nexus like hot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Not to mention how they completely screwed the loot system. Not only did they add ninja, which would be a good idea, if it weren't for the fact that they added a new weapon type, instead of using one of the ones already in the game, but I swear they also lowered the drop rate on gear.   For those who don't know about the game, the ninja's unique weapon means that about 75% of weapons that drop are completely useless. Before ninjas were in the game, 66% couldn't be used by your class. This is because ninja weapons drop as commonly as the other 4 types, even though the other 4 have 2-3 classes using them.  As for the lower drop rate, I can only assume that's so that they can sell more gear to people.  I really wish I could still like this game. I used to play all the time, and I had 3 8/8 characters, full tops/UT, including alt weapons and abilities, and tons of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in my vault. The sad thing is that I can't in good conscience tell anyone to play this game, because it's evolved into what I can only describe as a Facebook game.  Please, Kabam, I know you must have a heart. Please give control back to WildShadowStudios, they knew how to run this game better than you guys ever will. You are ruining what used to be my favorite game.
6625	0	a	Since Kabam bought this game it has been â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Wouldn't recommend for anyone.
6626	0	a	Completely different from when I started playing it. Used to be you unlocked new classes and saved your lvl 20 loot by actually being good. Community has always been heartless but at least the game used to be fun. Avoid like the plague.
6627	0	a	This game was fun, emphasis on was. I played it back when it was good but after it got sold out it became this big money machine designed to suck your wallet dry of paypals.Not to mention the only way to enjoy this game after you hit lvl 20 is to get high tier gear which is pretty difficult to do when you die easily without the gear and you lose all your stuff upon death, thus you have to use real money to buy items.
9359	1	a	I like the game alot and have started playing more everyday waiting for Deca Games to take over.
6628	0	a	Rip Wildshadow. Rip my chars. Rip obamacare. Rip my fun
9361	1	a	Fun and interesting game. Definitely worth a try!
6629	0	a	You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself be bought by Kabam.
6630	0	a	I still play it, but it was good, until they made it Pay to win...
6631	0	a	Let's Just Say...This used to be good.
6632	0	a	Pretty good for uninstalling.
9363	1	a	ruined my life
6634	0	a	Used to be a great game, now a sh*ty pay-to-win with microtransactions everywhere.
6635	0	a	Don't waste your time, any fun this game had months prior to coming on steam was very methodically removed by the devs. The very over inflated cash shop prices help drive the point home that this will never become anything awesome either, just a vessel for cash scam.  The original concept of the game was a simplistic fun game that allowed large groups of people to collaborate into an army to eventually topple the mad god. People would band together in very large groups to help level each other and take down bosses. A fun concept but due to the simplistic nature of the game, hardly something you want to dole out money for, especially considering the game is built largely from graphics that are open source. Cash shop perks however created the rise of the 'cashing loner' who could do alone what 50 or so players could accomplish. That also created these loners to corner anyone getting good equipment, creating a large rift in the player base, this essentially leads to 3 options in the game: 1) hack your way to the gear. 2) be forced to cash. 3) spend ages fighting for any progression.  Now these 3 routes are actually pretty typical of a free to play. Except Mad god has one more aspect that makes the taste even more sour, permadeath. Again with original concept of the game, permadeath wasn't so bad. The game was very pick up and play again, you didn't mind starting over because you never really had a lot of content to chew through so you never got too invested into any one character and there was other classes to try the game over from a new perspective. Now there is a lot more content to the game so dying for a free player even if they do as much planning as humanly possible, is a major setback, cash players can buy additional storage and even have soul bound items so they aren't exactly starting over every single time, adding to the gap between the players.  In all this game was a fun concept that was bled dry for every cent they could get and it shows plain as day.
9365	1	a	With so many moving parts to learn and a seemingly infinite breadth of options to explore, diving into any new MMO is a major investment of time and energy. It's exhausting, really, which is why I appreciate a game like the free-to-play Realm of the Mad God. This fantasy-themed, co-operative bullet hell MMORPG is beautifully simple, yet deep enough to keep you chained to your PC for days on end. It takes only a minute or so to get right into the action, and, once you get a taste for running around with a gaggle of your fellow pixelated-warriors raising hell and slaying beasts across the online realm, it's hard to stop.   Like any of the other thousands of players populating the bustling game world, you've been summoned by Oryx the Mad God to serve as dinner for his hungry minions. Of course, you've got other plans. Venturing out beyond the safety of the hub nexus, your mission is to blast beasties, collect loot, grow more powerful, and then stick it to the evil deity. Spraying magic projectiles around the screen while dodging incoming fire from blocky sumo wrestlers, dragons, goblin wizards, and stranger creatures you encounter takes on a classic, arcade-like quality. The straightforwardness is appealing â€“ move, shoot, collect â€“ and when you weave in exploration, obsessive loot hunting, RPG character growth and the camaraderie of smiting evil alongside other adventurers, sessions grow intensely hypnotic. Even if you never survive long enough get reach Oryx's doom lair, there's a ton of fun to be found in collaborating with other players in battle and unlocking cool new classes to play.   Each of Realm of the Mad God's 13 unique character classes are accessed by reaching certain level benchmarks in other classes. Above all, this is what kept me glued to my keyboard playing for hours at a time. You start as a mewling wizard who can fire blasts of magic in any direction, but as you play longer and level-up, you eventually open-up more interesting classes like the necromancer, huntress, mystic, and assassin. Every class has its own set of weapons and items, magic powers, special abilities, and perks. They all play differently, and I got a thrill every time I unlocked a new one to try out. This adds tremendous replay potential too, since unlocking the coolest characters requires you to spend some serious time with each class.   Perma-death layers-on an intense roguelike element to the already zany large-scale bullet hell RPG slugfest unfolding on any given server, and it seriously ups the challenge and risk factor. Getting careless will get you killed and force you to re-start your current character over from level 1. As frustrating as it can be, death is sometimes a welcome opportunity to try out another class, since you can only have one character at a time without using microtransactions to purchase additional slots. But when you're committed to keeping your favorite character alive, the threat of losing all your hard-earned experience and loot gently nudges you into working together with other players and forming impromptu gang of warriors to tackle the tougher swarms of foes as a group.   Realm of the Mad God's streamlined approach to MMO gaming also changes up player interaction in good ways. Since there's no PvP, everyone in the realm is after the same goals â€“ slay, loot, and level-up. As you come across other players, the desire to tag along and pitch in for tougher fights comes intuitively. You share the experienced gained from defeating foes as long as you hit them once, and there's generally plenty of loot to go around. Typing in chat text makes a speech bubble appear over your hero, and communicating in short bursts is effective for concocting plans outside of the heat of battle. When you do find other comrades you want to stick with, you can highlight nearby players and lock their names to your menu bar, allowing you to teleport to their location instantly if you get separated. It's a simple and easy-to-use system that works well.   The realm itself is surprisingly vast, with a diverse landscape that holds more dangerous and inventive foes the further you venture away from your spawn point. Weaker baddies, like scorpions and pirates, populate the sunny beachside. But push through the thick forests, crumbling ruins, and mountains beyond, and you'll find powerful god-like foes capable of slaying low-level adventurers with a single strike. It's these formidable opponents you have to defeat in order to reach Oryx. Thankfully, when you need a break from battle or a quick getaway, tapping the insert key warps you back to the safety of the nexus where you can trade, use fame points or in-game cash to purchase special items, form a guild, and heal-up.   It may be vastly different from its big-league brethren, but this stylish indie MMO has loads of staying power to match its unique concept. Realm of the Mad God&amp;#Array;s accessible arcade-style bullet hell action blends with RPG nerdiness in some truly potent ways, and the lovely pixilated world holds an abundance of adventure that&amp;#Array;s ripe for the taking. Easy to jump into and damn near impossible to quit, this unusual free-to-play MMO hybrid is worth every second of your spare time.
9367	1	a	This game has a long history with me. From Shadow to Kabam to Deca. I've seen it all. Played it in the browser and on steam. I can teel ya. It is a great game. Pay2Win? Ha! BS. Sure, You can pay for cosmetics and some useful tools. But I havent spent a single dime on this game and I have collected most items in the game. But I do warn you. Don't start playing this if you don't have a disciplined mind. This game will steal all of your time. And most people don't have the strength to pull away. Help me... Help me now...

9381	1	a	you like dying? this game is for you
9383	1	a	 'I am 8/8, but the game is 10/10.'    -Join now the  official Steam-Community ! 
6656	0	a	This was an amazing game. Had lots of fun. I played over 200 hours of it with my friends (Browser version) and played it a bit on Steam.  Problem is, this WAS an amazing game. Since Kabam bought it, it had turned from F2P to P2W. And is now unplayable without putting any money into it.  R.I.P RoTMG
9385	1	a	I have been playing this game for four years now. ( I have more hours logged than it shows because I play on Flash projector now ) I've logged probably around 2000 hours. The game is A ton of fun. But it is slowly and sadly dying because no devs work on the game anymore. I just hope they put a dev or two on the game, or sell it to someone who will. Long live rotmg. Get the game, try it out. It's enjoyable. 
9387	1	a	Can't spell 'Realm of the Mad God' without 'mad'. This game will make you want to tear your hairs out of your head at times.  Good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
6660	0	a	Review from a White star if it matters to anyone :P  -Quit for a couple months now-  So okay I have 1000+ hours on it on steam alone and afterwards, went to adobe flash projector for a couple hundred hours, so hopefully this review will help many of you decide whether or not you will like this game. This game is permadeath, when you die you lose all your items, equipped/anything in inventory aswell.  Game is very hard to pick up, consider looking up guides on YouTube or steam workshop for reference.  Pros: Gameplay is extremely addictive!  Dying isnt so bad and you 'usually' learn from your mistakes! (atleast I do) If losing all your 'Precious' items will be too much for your heart to bear, this is not the game for you. (Permadeath) All of the classes are worth playing, maybe except for a few.  As for the community, its up and down. Mostly filled with children. Rare to see anyone over the age 18, so you can imagine what the chat is like. Not saying the community is bad, people will sometimes help you out, and you can make friends via guild system. But most guilds will only invite you if you are actually good at the game, which is cruel, but w.e. Getting loot is so satisfying, especially those yummy white bags.  Cons: Event notifier Amount of bots (inevitable in a f2p game, but bearable with the new feature that can auto- hide the chat from low ranked players)  I always have a my chat filtered so I only see ranked 10stars or above basically since I hate seeing my chat flooded from either children talking/spamming, or trolls.  I don't know if this is still out there but there was this thing that was out that would notify you via realm if there is a special quest of your interest that spawned in. This-was-the-breaking point for me... The times where I would be chilling in my home realm and see (Sphinx/Hermit) I'd be so hyped, nowadays when the event spews out 'A sphinx entered the realm' atleast 60 people from from other servers drop in to get the chance to get some awesome loot.  So onto the hate for the company Kabam...They started up pets which helped alot of new players, but made veteren players very upset. It was a new system that tries to get you to spend your real money on 'feed' to feed your pets to make them heal you more or make other abilities better. If you have the bank account, you can make this game so easy, that the only way you die is by being extremely dumb, or getting armor broken, or doing very very hard dungeons.  Now I do understand the company has to make money to keep the game running so im not upset about what Kabam is doing. There are packs they release that are understandable and pretty tempting to purchase but of course you dont have to. Now If you understand how the game works this game can be played without using your precious money but the most tempting deals would be chests/character slots. Everything else can be avoided, unless you are really bad and need to get the best items to be able to play the game. (I exploit this and load up on pots to buy top items from kids who use parents credit cards to buy items)  IN MY HONEST OPINION, Kabam is not a bad company...they need to make money somehow right? If they weren't releasing these items/keys/deals how would this game still be alive?  Overall this game is for me was great when it didn't have the event notifiers, but since they are out, the game has been getting worse and worse.   There are probably many more cons than the ones I listed but those are the two main ones that upset me. Rate: 5/10  Anyone with questions can ask here, im open to all feedback good/bad.
6661	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.
9389	1	a	Deca added more than Kabam did in a year.
6664	0	a	This game WAS good. Then the Kabam nation attacked. They made it severely Pay To Win. When Wild Shadow owned it and oversaw the game, it was great, there was almost no pay to win elements in the game. Now, it is almost like an IOS game that is freemium. Sure, skill is still involved, but you HAVE TO PAY $$$$ to be good.   It is literally impossible to be good at this game unless you spend some money. You cannot be nearly decent at this game until you have a few character slots(you start off with one!!!!), a few vault chests(again, you start off with on!!!!), a good pet, and EXPENSIVE items that upgrade that pet.   As someone who has let their wallet vomit a bit too much( &gt;100$ spent in game), please for the love of not supporting this disgusting Pay To Win Freemium game model, don't get this game. And if you have it, dont spend $$. If you do, you are telling developers and cash grabbing companies that these kinds of games are okay to create and release to the good folk of the gaming community.
6665	0	a	I'm going to get a lot of hate for this. I'll just say that at first. but hear me out. The game is impossibly dificult to unlock other classes, and unless you buy money good gear is hard to get. You'll get torn to shreads with no hope of unlocking the next class. I'll say that if this game had a better way for better gear I would gladly play it more, but I'm not going to suport it unless it changes in some way.
6666	0	a	first of all, the cover art LIES. Second all you do i slay bosses and enimies then buy more sh** and it is imposible to get ONE token. emphisise on one, JUST ONE TOKEN. make a update where things are like the box art instead of one faced sprites and make tokens easier to get and maybe i will rate it better + others
9391	1	a	I haven't died this many times since Dark Souls.
9393	1	a	This game has taken over my life. Like seriously. My friend asked me to play all 200 hours ago and my god am I now addicted. The perma death stops you from playing but once you're used to it you just never stop playing. Every waking hour will be spent playing this. It is fun, the perma death is annoying, but once you get used to killing big stuff it's amazing. Better with friends.
9395	1	a	It's a really Great Game, and the statistics and methods of a Simple RPG Rogue-Like Are Made into this, its a really good way to tense players and also, you WILL DIE ALOT. It happens. But It's so worth seeing your mistake, and retrying it again. It shows you different ways to win. Its really Fun.
9397	1	a	This game would be amazing. IF THEY CARED ABOUT AUSTRALAINS AND GAVE US SERVERS  LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6671	0	a	i bought a pet humanoid and i never recieved it what should i do? please help
6672	0	a	Well, this game has definately got a case of 'Money Grubbing Developer Syndrome,' Doc. I never really played it that much, because I didn't have much fun at all. Practically everything half-decent in this game makes you do one of two things: Get stupidly good with your default class and get tons of gold, or pay stupid amounts of money. I mean, even F***ING PETS COST REAL MONEY! F***ING PETS!
9399	1	a	Its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lit
9401	1	a	I played this in public once and everyone around me made fun of me.
6674	0	a	How to play step 1. play game for a few mins  step 2.uninstall
6675	0	a	what happened to the shop?  Use points to buy items and cool stuff... poof now everything costs money but you can still buy a weapon for 50 or lower or something...poof now all that prices costs 51... poof now you start with 40 now you cant buy anything...
6676	0	a	YOU COULD ATLEAST GIVE YOU THE CHOICE TO NOT ERASE THE STUFF IN YOUR GIFT CHESTS!?!?!?!?!?!? PLEASE????!?!?!?!? I WASTED 50 DOLLARS ON STUFF BECAUSEI HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING IT ALL GOT DELETED WITHOUT A WARNING. IN MY OPINION YOU OWE ME 20 DOLLARS + â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DEVELOPERS
9403	1	a	I came for the sheep.
6681	0	a	I enjoyed this game for the very short time I was able to play it. I'm giving a bad review because of a game-breaking bug leaving myself, and many other players stuck out of the game, completely unable to play.  The developers are aware of the bug at this point, and after having many conversations with support about the issue, it seems that they simply don't care.  The bug in question, is getting stuck on the black screen with the grey 'Loading' ribbon across the bottom. Even if left for hours, the game will never actually load. I initially contacted support about this back in February, and I've had to make multiple tickets due to previous ones automatically closing.  To this day, the issue is still unresolved for me. I'll update this review if that changes, but I'll probably leave it as a negative because of what a joke the support team is.  Get your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together, Kabam, you're only harming yourself through losing potential customers.
6682	0	a	Pay 2 Win..... Thats all I have to say. Dont do it.
6683	0	a	God damn! Pay for this, pay for that.. It is really a fun/hard game to get used to, but come on.. Everything costs money!
9405	1	a	If maplestory was a browser game.....
6684	0	a	Used to be my fav game, but now you have to buy heaps of stuff to be good, tis a shame.
6685	0	a	Bring the old realm back, And â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up the god damn multiboxers.
9407	1	a	The game is very fun. But after level 20 it starts getting way too based in ONLY getting better items. (Which you can also simply purchase from the store) *Cough* Pay to win *Cough* You then spend hours risking your neck (Not to mention a simple lag spike when facing a boss will end in tears), to get a SOMEWHAT good item, try to trade it for something you want/need and WILL get scammed in the most ridiculous way.  10/10 will kill Scorpion Queens for hours.
9409	1	a	Thank you deca for bringing new hope for this old game.          (plz fix the nexus key delay and other unforgiving things :P)
9411	1	a	Good game hard to understand what to do at first but once you get the hang of it then it becomes an addiction.. well untill you die
6691	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ kabam man. kabam made a whole crap. It was good! it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good! (i got 100 hours or sth. at browser version)
9413	1	a	1,011 hrs, still have nothing. Isnt that enough to say about this game? Oh and im still playing
6694	0	a	I'm kinda new so how do I close this game?
9415	1	a	This has got to be one of my favorite free to play MMOs of all time. It has great coop gameplay which relies on skill to stay alive, and staying alive is very important because it is a PERMADEATH game. It runs in Flash, so its compatible with almost all systems. The graphics are a retro pixelated masterpiece and will definitely bring on the nostalgia. The game has no ending, making it very addictive. This game is still being updated regularly and new content is being added all the time. There are 14 classes to unlock, loads of items to be found, dungeons for all skill levels, and a guild system to help encourage cooperation.  This game is also full of bugs that are difficult to fix, given the nature of the coding. The bugs aren't game-breaking but can get annoying at times. There is an unsolvable issue with memory leaks that will force you to restart the game every hour or so. Spambots advertise for websites that sell items illegally. Do not buy anything from them. The items they sell can be farmed in the game without spending any money. There is a trading system which you can use to buy, sell, trade, or gift items with other players. Do not spend money on items, it is a waste!  Some people, including myself, experience a bit of lag when playing the Steam version of this game. If you have issues such as input delay, I encourage you to give it another shot by playing it at its home,  www.realmofthemadgod.com .  With all that in mind, I still thoroughly enjoy this game and support its development by buying extra vault space and character slots. I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill based shooters and MMORPGs. Did I mention its FREE?!  Update: Since I quit playing RotMG regularly, a lot has changed. The old management is out and new people have taken their place and seem to be doing much better. They seem to make much better use of their resources and have their priorities in a much better order. The game and owners/developers are making much needed progress and deserve a little recognition.
9417	1	a	It's a fun game , it's permadeath , but you have a vault where you can put stuff for your characters if you die. Only one chest if you're F2P like me. The game itself is hard and requires some getting used to. Dying is normal in the game, every character dies eventually, even if you have the best armors and weapons and you're maxed and have a legendary pet. So buckle up for this 2d bullet-hell farmfest , where you farm for gear and potions, which you will lose eventually.
6695	0	a	It used to be good, but then the game started adding pay to win features.
9419	1	a	This game is literal â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hell, not to say it isn't a fun as hell experience. It's roguelike, so if you die when you're lv 20, that 14 hours you put into that character is gone. It's fun, but hard.
6697	0	a	this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sucks. â™¥â™¥â™¥. there are so many bots that i cant even find ONE PERSON. justin beiber/10
9421	1	a	2012 review: AMAZING game!!! First ever truly FREE game, where supporting the creators doesn't give you an unfair advantage. Very good game!  2016: So yea.. that was awhile go wasn't it? Alot has changed.... for the worse. The game is not truly 'free' anymore, there are numerous pay2win factors in the game. The game is still good and fun at times but it has some serious issues.   I pretty much quit, I come online now and then to run a couple dungeons and then I'm off. Sometimes I go for longer when I decide to stream abit. I feel like this game does not deserve any players and should just die off already. What kabam is doing to the players and the game is horrible.  From reading the forums you see alot of people that are done with the game. They either want to quit or ask questions about the longevity of this game. And there's certain people that keeps feeding the community this idea that as long as you support the game (buy gold) it will not shut down. Now maybe this is correct, but I dont think we should promote and feed such a company. They have literally done nothing for the past like year? No new content or adaptations of dungeons, no promised changes. And dont even bring up the 'that was another team'. If they trash ideas, communicate this. It's ridiculous how infested with cheaters this game is. I bet over 50% of the players are cheaters or have cheated at one point to build up their accounts. Not to mention the game being overrun with multiboxers.  I think people go easy on kabam because of their love for this game.  The game is good and enjoyable. But it is also an MMO, and such games require maintenance and regular updates to keep stuff fresh and exciting. I'm getting the same vibes when hacking first became visible widely and people just basically ignored it because it did not hurt them. And look where we are now. Yes they have put on some sort of fix for event notifiers. But not after ALOT of complaints, we can wake them up if we really want them to.  I'm truly amazed at the people that can still religiously play this game every day. How do you not become bored after an hour? Is it because you are addicted? Have nothing else to play? Because trust me, there are ALOT of great games out there with developers that DO care.  Of course we do not KNOW what is up with kabam, maybe they are rewriting the entire game? But the fact remains, there is no communication whatsoever. And they've basically let the game run on autopilot.  So if you want to play a bullet hell, permadeath mmo then by all means play this game. The game is still good and you can do fine without buying gold. But I will also tell you to not get invested in this game, it honestly does not deserve your time. Once you've reached the endgame stuff will become stale rapidly. If you can endure the cheaters and multiboxers and lack of communcation/updates from the developers that is.  DECA has taken over from Kabam now. So far it seems to be going in the right direction. They have fixed a duping exploit fairly quickly and made some additions to the game suggested by the players. Let's hope they keep this up.
9423	1	a	Realm of the Mad God is both one of the best games I've ever played and one of the worst. I first started playing the game in April of 2012 with a couple of friends. Initially, I wasn't hookedâ€”pixel graphics, permadeath, MMO, bullethell...none of them exactly appealed to me. I drove the game from my mind completely.   But a few days later, in a bout of extreme boredom, I decided to hop into the game. Gave myself a nameâ€”Nathansbudâ€”and hopped into the fray. And by God, it was FUN! Sure, I was horrible, but that didn't stop me from having a great time running around the lowlands. After that point, I was hooked through and through. I played the game for nearly a year without really getting 'good' in the least, until I finally maxed my first character (which can be accomplished by drinking enough stat pots to hit the max, items which drop from a variety of enemies and dungeons), an Archer. I had this character for months, and it ended up being my first character to hit 5 Stars, or 2000 fame (experience, essentially).   Fast forward to now, 4.5 years into playing Realm of the Mad God (with a year break in between). The game has had its ups and downs, good times and bad, some overtly P2W features were implemented at times, but all in all, the game is certainly worth picking up and playing. And if you do end up giving it a shot (which you should, as the game is free), shoot me a PM. I'm Nathansbud in game.  Overall: 9/10
9425	1	a	So simple, so cute, so... intense and hardcore. Bullet-hell MMO in pixel-art with permadeath. Better in small doses, otherwise it gets too repetitive. Dive in for 30min to 2hours, it's free.
9427	1	a	it may say i recomend this game but i dont know wether i should or should not Its IS a very very fun and to me addicting game but haveing been bought by kabam it got less fun alot less but other the the 70% micro tranactions its a very fun decent game i still recomend it to ppl that dont care about anything i just said
9429	1	a	I started playing this game in 2010 (not on Steam, I guess I have less than 300 hours played). It has changed a lot since that time - sound effects have changed, content was added, already existing items and enemies were balanced and, last but not least, the game was sold to another studio. Twice.   The time when RotMG belonged to first one, Wildshadow Studios, was probably the best time of the game. Game was simple and fun to play, Pay to Win almost didn't exist. In 2012 RotMG was sold to Kabam. They made it a bit Pay to Win, they also did nothing aganist hackers. Later, they decided to work on their other games instead of RotMG, but in July 2016 Deca Games bought RotMG - they keep adding new content and events and they finnaly started fighting aganist notifier hackers. Now it's really a good time for the game.  RotMG is a bullet-hell, team MMORPG with A LOT of different items, monsters and dungeons. All 14 classes are available for free (you only need a bit of time to get 'em all) and are almost perfectly balanced. You can play support/dps/tank (often mixed in one character), whatever you want. There's also a possibility of joining a guild consisting of other players. Overall, the game is indrecibly fun to play despite being a bit Pay to Win - there's a perma-death, character loses all of his items upon dying. MMO Dark Souls for free.  You can have a lot of fun playing RotMG, especially with a group friends, or a guild and you don't have to spend a lot of time on it.  8/10 would lose everything again
6702	0	a	amazing concept amazing community     the devs on the other hand...
9431	1	a	Cool RPG with hundreds items, characters customization, different enemies and open world. 9/10 :D
9433	1	a	This game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥ and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. In order to have any fun in this game, you need to hit level 20 with your character, but the game does everything in it's power to stop you. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, that's what it is. When you die, YOU LOSE YOUR CHARACTER AND EVERYTHING YOU HAD, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T GAME! Even though you swear never to play this game again, you always come back for more and the same thing will happen, resulting in a endless cycle.   -10/10 would play again
9435	1	a	its ok
6706	0	a	fun to play for like 10 minutes     then it gets boring and redundant   if u gonna play play as the priest so y'all can dab in the church
9437	1	a	Rotmg in a nutshell: 1. Max 2. Farm 3. Fill your vault 4. Die 5. Rage 6. Repeat  And ofc draggers !   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c8wn4c8OCo  Short video about rotmg !
9439	1	a	This game was good. Then Kabam bought it and it slowly became bad. And now a new company called 'Deca Games' bought it from Kabam. They did more work in 2 weeks than Kabam did in 3 years. I have hope and faith.   DECA MAKE ROTMG GREAT AGAIN, WE BELIEVE IN YOU!
9441	1	a	It's an fun game, i've been playing it since 2012, but on the browser version. The only bad thing about the Steam version is that the gameplay screen (sumthin liek dat) is too big for me. Gameplay screen? Uhh... Screen resolution? Ehhm.. I don't know. But still, it's an good game. Steam version rating = 7 / 10 Browser version rating = 9 / 10 Total rating out of 20 = 16 / 10 Above 15 means that it's recommended, so i recommend to play this awesome game.
6707	0	a	I used to play this game on kongregate. Tons of 8-bit fun and then I saw it was on steam, so I downloaded it and for some reason the steam version has tons of gliches and bugs and my game crashed multiple times. Not worth it!(even if it's free) If you want to try this game, I suggest going on Kongregate and playing the flash version. Also for some reason it might say on this review that I have 0 hrs on record. Not sure why, but i have played this game for hours.
6708	0	a	I didn't like it.... The same music is playing all the time. I wish this game had multipile soundtracks. Also this game is filled with spammers what makes normal chatting impossible. But this is just my opinion. I am not really trying to stop you from playing this game.
6709	0	a	play this game, if you are as rich a taylor swift and can afford microtransactions ,to only lose all that money to lag and scammers. If you want to live longer uninstall and get a new steam account that doesnt have to game.
6710	0	a	The Kabam is real
9443	1	a	An interesting and simple game. ROTMG is a great 2D MMORPG in which you fight monsters, level up and find loot! The gameplay is simple and easy to learn but very addictive. It has different stategies and approaches such as tanking, evasion, supporting etc. There are many different classes to choose from and you can unlock more as you master the others!  A great free and addictive game, and only a few MBs, worth a download!  9/10
6711	0	a	well the game is completly PAY To â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING WIN! now that it sucks! i realy hate kabam!
9445	1	a	Love this game so much.Hope deca make it even better
6712	0	a	I wish I could recomend this... I use to play this all the time. In it's prime it was one of the best games on steam. Over the years though the playerbase has died and the devs have become greedy. I wowld recomend it in it's prime but not at the state it's in now.
6713	0	a	Kabam rigged this like a demolitions expert. Let me elaborate. This was a nice local resturant, with a speciality meal hardly seen before. It was a mix of rogue-like and bullet hell. There were bullets everywhere and if you couldn't handle the heat, it was back to the start. But starting over isn't all bad. You got fame, a currency that could be used on goods to get yourself running hotter. You could also unlock new classes for a spin on the taste. It was a nice resturant, filled with a jovial atmosphere. But then the owner handed it over to a rather greedy man. Now it is a pit of money and shame, filled with people looking to scam and the food reminicent of a fast food resturant. Nobody was happy, but the owners.

9451	1	a	If you are a person who does not like to lose everything from the slightest mistake or just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ move, this is not the game for you.........In a lovely open 8-bit game where you could think things are easy then you find a path then a grenade happy medusa comes out of no where to kill you, then the biggest thing happens........ you start over again. Think before playing this game and be familliar with W-S-A-D movement......ENJOY!
6721	0	a	Kabam is simply a network of greedy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es who pay no money for their servers and half the time you get sucked in by oryx, pro or not.
6722	0	a	This game, oh god this game. RotMG was fun when TIGsource was the lead dev but now Kabam now owns RotMG and they ****** up. Kabam made this game from actual fun to pay-to-pay. There is permadeath so all of your levels, items and cool skins you got are gone ad you have to restart again. you can pretty much BUY all of your gear making all of your stuff have no value at all. And to top all of this off you can't even play right now because LOGIC i give this game 1.0000000000001/10
6723	0	a	Neck yourself.....
6724	0	a	Why would I recommend this? well this game has SOOOO SO much potential, and i heard it used that potential for good, but i have seen reveiws saying it only wants your money, i think this is true, i cant even play, i launch the game and login but the bottom right of my screen is taken up by an ad begging for your money, I CANT EVEN PLAY BECAUSE THEY WANT MONEY!
6725	0	a	If You Run out into the realm like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with expensive items you bought with real money   Youre gonna have a bad time
6726	0	a	Though Realm of The Mad God may be an excellent game, I have no idea, I found many connection issues while trying to play. This may be due to servers being located in a reach from the UK or just my internet connection but sadly, I cannot reccomend this game as my experiance was very poor.
9453	1	a	2nd Best Free to Play EVER
9455	1	a	I guess this game is ok. :D
6727	0	a	{Rant}  Game used to be one the most fun games I will ever have played but new developers have ruined it to its core. Too many micro-transactions and a lot of focus on paying to win basically. Pets are the key to survival which are insanely hard to get up to speed without farming trench's or etc. for a long time without paying money. And all new dungeons, and items, and in general game updates are focused around spending money for top tier gear whether it be the mystery box with a low chance for an extreme payout, or buying 'tops' straight up. 8 '8/8's' no longer feels like I earned it since anyone can buy tops and farm fairly easily (but most likely die and give me a good laugh), UT's drop frequently and the game just feels like a massive, overpowering player base with no challenge any longer (especially with pets) and is just a waste of time to farm.  {Summary} Large changes such as UT's being non-tradeable or the disappearance of amulets is not what ruined the game, it's the most recent p2w schemes, aka mystery box of profit that tear away from the core point of farming and finally having the RNG in your favor for that moment when you've achieved a great set after good work, not having exclusive items in the mystery box that won't be in a dungeon for 3 months...  {Suggestion} I love Warframe and League of Legends, for some reason a LOT of RoTMG players left for league, not sure why but I was hooked also so check them out, realm is just not worth the time any longer. And Warframe gives a perfect feel for the payout for time you put in farming, very Face of Mankind esque but updated constantly and very satisfying to play unlike another great games downfall.   (The Big Lebowski) Has the world gone crazy? Seen too many games go to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥....
9457	1	a	Me and my friends thaught we would play this once for 2 minutes but this game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9459	1	a	IS FUN SO U SHOULD BUY IT 
9461	1	a	be dyin' erey day yo, still ain't mad. But yeah, this is a REALLY, REALLY addicting game. It's gonna be very hard NOT to spend money on it, but it's worth it if you like the game enough.  (edit: a year after i wrote this)  i still die every day, my characters literally do not last for more than 5 days. my mind practically revolves around this game and i've spent around $300 on it. i've invested around 700+ hours on this piece of rainbow â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and my deaths actually do frustrate me now because i'm actually maxed.   but anyway, this game is better when playing with friends, or if you have a guild. when it's late and you're the only one up, you can just relax and farm in the godlands. even if you're rich as hell, npe's with friends will help ease the boredom. this game also has its own economy, not like cs:go, tf2, or dota where you could trade via steam and steam chat, but in the game itself, and the company that owns the game will help you with all your problems but they do not care about trading itself, only bug fixes and blah blah. trading in this game isn't as profitable as godlands farming though, due to the amount of time it takes although you could always go on realmeye which is similar to tf2outpost or cs:go lounge to post trades and wait for someone to PM you while youre actually playing the game.  the main goal in this game is probably to max. 6/8 is a start to new players. for players who already have all 12 characters 8/8 maxed with all the gear they want, they usually make another set of backup characters or start a collection - like all the ut's in the game or all the treasures or all the tops.  i see nothing wrong with the community besides (i say nothing and besides in the same sentence ironicly) some chat spammers who could easily be ignored, and even notifers seem to be a problem but i don't mind them. the people are fine though, except for the leechers, but can you blame them? - update 8 months after i wrote the second update: i like how they fixed the notifers. i didn't understand it at first, since i thought any time you entered a realm you'd have to wait 2 minutes but it makes sense on how you could just nexus in case you almost die or store some pots in your inventory and re-enter the realm without having to wait.  anyway, realm lag. it's not your internet, it's realm, it always has been realm. i haven't played in months (though i have around 1,300 hours on it including my hours on steam) and i can see that the lag is slightly better, but not all the way better. there's still only around 3-4 lucky hours of the day where there's no noticable lag. i'm sure with the hella loads of updates they did a month or two ago this summer that they tried fixing it, still i don't see why they can't add more ram to the servers with the amount of money people spend in a month of just playing the game.  i think that's one of the main reasons people stop playing realm. the first reason is that realm is the gamer's heroin and you should probably only play under an hour a day, 3 days a week or you'll get sucked into the vortex of neverending gameplay and the financially broke life.
9463	1	a	Great game if you like a free rome action packed dungeon rpg
9465	1	a	I LOVE THIS IS GAME. Nickname:ChLeno
9467	1	a	It's aight for me. But you can literally play this on the dank web itself. :/. So why download it
9469	1	a	Just hours and hours of game play, so many things to do..... i cant stop playing it
9471	1	a	i like the sounds
6731	0	a	Don't get me wrong, at the early stages of this game it was great fun to run around with your friends, loot, clear dungeon, and kill Oryx. However, since late 2013 when Kabam came to ownership the game became extremly P2P. If you want to ever get anywhere in the game you have to buy multiple character and vault chests so that you have backup characters and loot. Vault chests only hold 8 items and cost 5 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dollars a piece. Aswell as making most legendery loot hard as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to obtain, they took out trading of UT items, So once you get the legendary loot if its not for your class you're SOL. My reccomendation is to avoid playing this until Kabam lifts their P2P hammer.
9473	1	a	I thoroughly enjoy playing Realm of the Mad God. Gameplay is crazy and fast paced and I love the 8-bit graphics! The only downsides are that it's a little 'play to win' and lag spikes might cause your character to die - and dying is permanent here.
9475	1	a	I can make a new review for this game, considering the new owner/host of the game: Deca Games.  They took charge and started working on the game again.   Here's what they've done so far:  1. Spam bots are completely gone, and some of the multi-boxers and hackers are gone. 2. Brought back life into the game by bringing the community together for a big celebration of Month of the Mad God. 3. Gave out free rewards to those active in the community. With Events and such.  Pros:  1. Very rewarding, Challenging dungeons give the better loot. 2. Good community on reddit and mostly in-game too. 3. A Star ranking system based off how many class challenges you've completed by hard earned, long lived characters. 4. DEATHLY addictive. (sorry)  Cons: 1. P2W, buying (gold) will allow you to get some of the best gear. 2. Difficult, hard to get used to dieing. (Even thought its part of the game) 3. Until recently, the game had a bad owner, Game is recovering.  I recommend this game, 7.9/10 :^)
9477	1	a	This game ruined my life.
9479	1	a	i like the sounds
9481	1	a	I guess this game is ok. :D
9483	1	a	Me and my friends thaught we would play this once for 2 minutes but this game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9485	1	a	Ive played this game for years on kongregate, and when I saw it on steam, I downloaded it immediatly. This is a great RPG game that makes you collect, and better yourself with quests and loot. However, this is a game where you may need friends to make it an enjoyable experience. You can lock onto your friends and teleport to them so you never lose them. I strongly suggest getting this game, if you have a friend or two to play it with.
9487	1	a	Rotmg, is one of my favorite games. Even know there is a LOT of advertisment is still is really addicting and fun. It is really simplistic graphics too which you've probaly heard a lot but guys, girls its a free to play so who cares of course you can buy your way to the top its not really a pay to win because there isnt really any pvp so its more like pay to get the best gear faster because i can get best gear for a charcter in a day. So its not like ridculously hard to get good. just time and effort and youll get there.
9489	1	a	RotMG has had something of a checkered past. From it's storied inception at the hands of indie dev Wildstorm Studios to it's dubious sale to Kabaam, and now this latest chapter as the game is once again sold to Deca Games. Let's be clear. The time with Kabaam were some dark days. But it speaks to the resiliency and devotion of the fanbase/community that so many players soldiered on through the bad times and stayed with this game for so long.   Kabaam's handling of bugs and duping was poor. Really poor. One of the biggest issues when I last player the game about two years ago was that the 'Amulet of Resurrection'... the only item in the game that could save your character if it was 'killed' was normally a very expensive and difficult to acquire item. But so many people were duping them that the in game economy was flooded with them and no one was dying. Turn and churn is a really big part of this game so when no one dies the game stagnates. Kabaam handled this complex issue with a sledgehammer turning all the amulets into 'Amulets of Zombification.' I personally felt violated. They went into my vault inventory and took items I had earned and replaced them with something far inferior without asking me or discussing it with me. I was already furious.   Then they completely botched their communication with the community. Telling us that this new amulet had a 5% chance of turning your character into a Zombie and thus... failing to save it. When your character is dead in RotMG it's dead. Nothing is saved. So when you lose a maxed character with great gear it's a big deal to a lot of players. And it turned out that the Amulet that was supposed to only have a 5% chance of letting us die was in fact about 95%. Everyone started dying and turning into zombies. I lost a maxed 8/8 Huntress that turned into a Zombie and I was furious. I walked away from the game and hardly looked back despite having three other maxed characters. Time passed.   Kabaam eventually created a pet system to replace the Amulet. No your pets can't save you if you die. But by grinding and grinding you can create a pet so powerful that bosses and dungeons that were super dangerous are far less so. But other than the introduction of a lot of new dungeons and content that seems to be the end of Kabaam's major changes. And bugs and duping have persisted this entire time.  For example there's a bug that if you try and drag an item into your inventory and someone else snags the item (often with the reviled 'auto pickup' programs that many players now must use to compete with multi-boxers and hackers) before you get it all the way into your inventory it creates a 'ghost' of that item. This ghost will not disappear. And it can block and make useless as many as four inventory slots. And with only 8 slots on the base character that can really hamper your ability to pick up items. What's worse the 'ghost' cannot be dispelled without reloading the program entirely. Merely going to the Nexus, your vault or changing realms works. The item 'ghost' even persists in the loading screen. And while I understand this was done to fix a duping bug a better solution SURELY should have been found in the two years that have passed since I first encountered it.   But despite these issues RotMG is one of the most consistently fun and addicting games I've ever played. And with the sale to Deca games there's hope that their profession of being fans and devotees of the game themselves will lead to long needed fixes and improvements. For example, there's no way to play fullscreen. The game was originally designed to play on a small computer monitor inside a web browser and that initial design has never been improved upon. Despite the game being years old and being passed to it's 3rd developer and losing a lot of its playerbase there is still no way to play it full screen. In Steam you can stretch the window to make it bigger than the tiny default window... but beware, because if you don't keep the aspect ratio correct... and there is no way to constrain it, you can throw off the way the game is presented to you. The best case scenario is some menus will only present half their information and some ads may block your inventory. The worst case is thinking there is a monster in a certain spot when it is actually a bit closer to you and to the left. It can get you killed if you aren't careful.  Another issue is the HP and Mana Pots. Not the stat pots but the blue and red potions that you use to replenish lost HP or magic power while in a fight. Initially Kabaam, in a rather blatant money grab, made it so when you ran out of these pots and hit the hot key to use one the system would automatically take five 'Gold' (the in game currency that is purchased for real world money) and sell you the pot instead of telling you that you were out. After much furor from the community Kabaam implemented an off switch for this in the controls. However I have found that if you do shut off auto purchasing these pots and then hit the hot key when you are out of them and in a fight a large UI box pops up, covering much of your fighting area, and asking you if you want to buy the pot for 5 gold as you are out. It's horrifying. It almost got my 8/8 Knight killed twice in a five minute period. Really freaked me out and it's a really poor implementation.   Additionally I'd say there are issues altogether with the way these pots are sold. Mana and HP Pots are super easy to get. A high level character is so powerful that the low level mobs that drop them get mowed down like bowling pins by maxed out characters. Yet it can be time consuming and annoying to be farming baby mobs just so you have a bit of healing and magic replacement for the dungeons and big fights you actually want to be doing as a maxed character. And purchasing these pots at 5 Gold is a ridiculous and usurious price to charge for something so easily obtained and unimportant to the game. It's like charging a person for putting air in their tires. Sure there are coin operated air compressors but I have yet to run into a service station that doesn't simply turn it on for free. Because while we all realize you need air in your tires it isn't something of great value or scarcity. The same goes for these pots. They are neither valuable nor scarce but you need them. And high level players wasting time scouring the land for them is sort of silly. My hope is that this new owner, Deca Games; in addition to making many other improvements and bug fixes, sees the wisdom in reducing the price for these items and encouraging their use at the same time. For example you can carry up to six of each of these pots for a total of twelve. Can you imagine how much more gold Deca would sell and how more often these micro purchases would be made if they simply offered to top your inventory off for one gold? Imagine... you're going out to the realm and you want to head to the god lands or someone is opening a dungeon in the Nexus. You hit a button and for one gold you get your HP and Mana pots inventory filled up. I'd do this at least once almost every time I played. Probably for multiple characters.   Right now gold is roughly 100 to 1 in real world to in game value. So one dollar US is equal to 100 Gold. So at the current rate buying HP and Mana pots to fill your inventory of six each would cost a staggering sixty cents. More than half a dollar for something so unimportant. Thus I and most players have NEVER purchased them. But if it was 1 gold to fill er up. You bet your â™¥â™¥â™¥ I'd use it.   Deca Games is doing a lot of giveaways and has proclaimed this and the following four weeks the 'Month of the Mad God.' There's a lot of celebrating and they've done an excellent job of energizing and motivating the community on social media. Lets hope that energy carries over to improvements and new content for the game. But even if it doesn't. RotMG is crazy fun.
9491	1	a	Great Black Friday shopping simulator. You play as different types of people, all desperatly scrambling to aquire items before someone else does. Occasionally all the players are summoned to a giant Wal-Mart where everone gets together to break down the doors, slaughter all the employees, and track down the manager, Oryx, murder him and try to snatch his belongings.
9493	1	a	it's a fun mmo with a fairly good trading system and fun game play. There is perma death but you can avoid by drinkin stat poitions from enemy drops or trade up for better loot.
9495	1	a	I can make a new review for this game, considering the new owner/host of the game: Deca Games.  They took charge and started working on the game again.   Here's what they've done so far:  1.

9497	1	a	So I played this game for a long while. What deca (yes I'm looking at you /u/sil3x) could do to make the game better is to look over some of the community dungeon ideas. Some of these ideas are so good that they are more polished than dungeons that are already in the game. But you guys are already doing such a great job getting straight to work fixing duping and still being able to interact with us and host fun events. Keep it up :)  To any new people looking at this game it is worth playing if you can get past the constant death at the beginning.
9499	1	a	Not as fun as back in 2012, but still a decent game. I still have a lot of fun playing with my friends. However, there's been an overall nerf to the game's difficulty that I do not like
9501	1	a	It is very fun but when you die your so mad at it. 
9503	1	a	this game made me poop my pants it was soo gud 
6737	0	a	This game SUCKS! All you are doing is running around, paying money and fight some bosses that spawn every second. Why could people call this a good game? Okay, the combat is pretty fun, but come on. Just running around with NO freaking goal?  2/10  It would be a 1/10 if the combat wasn't fun.
6738	0	a	To be honest if there was an option of recomending it and not, i would choose that. I mean this game is just that to me, 50/50. See, let me start off by saying i played this on Kong back in October of 2011, loved it. A few laggy moments but that was because of an overloaded server (which is very unlikely to happen). Than summer of 2012 came. And oh boy, did it start to change. I have been noticing the monoplizing of the market place, everything was very steeply priced, and i couldn't afford it. So i played as a noob for about a year or so. Left ROTMG, left Kong. And came to steam. And then i found ROTMG, i was exstatic. It was very nostalgic for me. But then i noticed the market, it got HUGE, little portals to smaller markets, eggs, food, and dungeon keys, it was very surreal. And then i finally gave in, and bought some vaults (because i started getting good and had little to no area to put my loot). Big mistake, that was when Kabam milked my steam wallet dry. I mean it was my decision, but my back was against the wall, the game that i loved back then, or other games. And that is why i don't recomend ROTMG, it started out play to win, now its just pay to win. 4.5/10
9505	1	a	good for laggy and non laggy pcs 
9507	1	a	Twas sick in mah day boi u get mi yeh it gud cuz it fun but eye cnt plai now cuz pentium sux poo
6739	0	a	Was a really good game before, but now its a pay2win kinda game. It can be fun but its very grindy.
9509	1	a	Should be called 'Realm of the Rage Quitters'
9511	1	a	I can make a new review for this game, considering the new owner/host of the game: Deca Games.  They took charge and started working on the game again.   Here's what they've done so far:  1.

9513	1	a	Just hours and hours of game play, so many things to do..... i cant stop playing it
9515	1	a	A fun little MMO with its own bitz of fun! It's a fast-paced, bullet hell, bit game with some pretty decent tracks. Honestly the game did a great job for what it is. It may have a few problems and there is room for improvement. Really you should just hop on if you want a quick and free bullet hell, but also invite your friends. Other than that Great game overall.  8.4/11 -Dj Shady
6740	0	a	Worst game ever played.

9519	1	a	It's k.
9521	1	a	This game is so fun, it test you how much will you be able to survive and in the meanwhile unlocking other characters.!
9523	1	a	RotMG is an MMORPG where the player is thrown into a wide world where everyone just wants to hurt you. Why? No idea. I was too lazy to read the lore that we have posted on our lovely site of RealmEye. However, the overall game is a great concept, where you slowly get better, pick up items, drink potions to increase your stats, and then.. well.. die. If permadeath games trigger your anger senses this game isn't for you. But, if you love grinding (stats that is) and watching yourself get better slowly over time, then this game is a great choice.  With a new company in place, we are going to be seeing a new era as the game changes to their views. It's a great time to start playing as Month of the Mad God, a celebration of the game's release, is in place.
9525	1	a	Nice game
9527	1	a	Fair game. Very fun to play. It is packed to the brim with microtransactions, but if you become skilled enough at killing and looting in the mountains, there is really no need to buy items from the main hub. It is rather ludicrous that you have to buy character slots and storage that should be immediately available to you. Just greedy, if you ask me.
9529	1	a	This game is amazing now that Deca has taken over! They should even consider improving the starter pack dlc to boost sales, as well as give the players a LOT of interesting perks and goodies to play around with. Free customization for the players anyone? How about a cute-looking Robot Tank based off of Steam itself?
9531	1	a	For people thinking about trying this game: If you like RPG's where you can loot up, play with friends and get amazing items as well as drink potions till you max that class and play many classes and rank up on your journeys this is the game for you, but TAKE CAUTION for if you die, you will lose all the items on that character, you can also put items in your vault to keep for future characters. Upgrade pets and teach them to heal you and give you mana, or attack enemies. This is all around one of my most favorite games and I have played over 1,300 hours in under 2 years.
9533	1	a	Very nice community. Perfect with friends. Lots of replay value. So much to explore. Overall, pretty fun!
9535	1	a	It's good, what else should i say?
9537	1	a	I know everyone is Upset with the Pay2Win mechanics of the game, but I assure you the game is still fun. Most people who pay for their gear arent the greatest and will eventually die with it anyway. Playing through the game and getting better with each dungeon will tone your skills. I have only ever spent money on some extra vault space and character slots with the Noob pack, 200 hours of Game play and I am using the top tier loot and have leveled my own pet up without paying.    Don't blame those who Pay2Win as a reason for ruining the game. I do think Kabam should remove Tops from the store though.
9539	1	a	Its a good game, but one problem, unmoderated chat, theres a TON of spam. You have to buy gold, and its exetremely hard to get to live long enough to get decent gear
6745	0	a	This game used to be a very fun and exciting game to play. But ever since Kabam took over, the game became a Pay to Win game. You could buy end game items in the nexus with money and stuff. The game is now filled with Hackers, Dupers, Multiboxers, and etc. R.I.P, RotMG.
9541	1	a	Okay, this is a tricky game to review, so bear with me.   The people think that the game is just 'pay to win' now aren't exactly right. Of course there is still buying items and you can't get some items without buying them with USD or other currency, but that doesn't mean you necessarily have to buy the items to have fun in the game. You can have just as much fun without buying items.    Second, you can't just play this game for 5 minutes, die by a sumo wrestler and review this game bad.   You cannot be good at this game in a whiff, practice is needed      Some people seem to forget the difference between a terrible game and a really hard game. This is not a terrible game. Kabam has not ruined this game, they have just tried their best to make a profit on Realm of the Mad God, because they bought it, you think it's going to be cheap buying a popular game?    Anyways, it has mindless fun. Once you become good with this game, it gets fun doing the events like the Lord of the Lost Lands, and see the new dungeons like the Ice Cave and the Puppet Master's Theater (yeah, you like those dungeons don't you guys, they were from KABAM!) And the most satisfying moment is when you go to a dungeon hoping for something rare and   you get what you want.   It is so satisfying.      The features of the game
9543	1	a	A game about mob mentality and the consequences of mob mentality.
9545	1	a	A very hectic game where there is always something going on. If you dont like restarting often, I would not recommend this to you. If you like free, pretty fun, but sometime frustrating games, then I would recommend this to you.
9547	1	a	Don't play this game
9549	1	a	One of the most greedy companies out there, Kabam, has FINALLY sold this game to a new and much more promising one: DECA games. This is somewhat of a godsend if you ask me, as Kabam had given up on the game a while ago and weren't active at all.  In the short time that DECA has been at the steering wheel, they have already made miracles happen and shown that they aren't afraid to take the game down for a day while fixing a few things. This proves that they're capable of changing things Kabam didn't care about and that they are quick to act when crisis strikes. Due to Kabams inactivity, they game had slowly began to die out and lose most of its dedicated players. With DECA, the game has been revived, and A LOT of players have returned.   The future is bright for the Realm.
9551	1	a	Pixel artsy bullet hell top down shooter. One of the most frantic bullet hell shooters out there. Despite the large P2W themes, I believe that you can easily earn your way up, with a small amount of panicked grinding. Even the grinding is frantic, as once you die, YOU LOSE EVERYTHING.  Both pleasure and pain, I highly reccomend this game.
9553	1	a	This game has a long and fabled history.  It began as an indie game concieved by the lengendary wildshadow studios.  It was brought by a big AAA company, Kabam.  And now it lies in the hand of yet another indie game company, Deca games.  This game is suprisingly amazing. A simple concept, flawlessly executed, for near-perfection. It's been a pay-to-win game in it's Kabam era, but in the Deca games era, I hope it will return to pay for convience. The lack of friends playing this game, and it's aforementioned monetary supplication system are what made me stop playing it, but it's a great game to waste hours in.  The interesting combination of genres lends to it's replayablity, and honestly it's what's kept me coming back to it, time and time again.  I would reccommend playing it in between more serious games. :)
9555	1	a	Made murder my whole family  -10/10
6751	0	a	I am a very old payer of this game, ever since WildShadow owned it and there was the old forums. This game used to be amazing, fun, interactive and enjoyable. You had to put time into the game to get anywhere, and even then you could lose it all in one death. Regardless of that, it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put 5+ hours a week. Personally, I was very addicted to this game during 2011 and 2012. Then, doomsday came: Kabam bought Realm of The Mad God. Everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things. Back in the old days, you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier 12 item in the wine cellar. Now, just buy realm gold and get tier 12 items in nexus. It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up. Unless you're rich as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and don't care about money, don't get this game.
9557	1	a	This game has gone through VERY BIG rough patches with Kabam. However DECA games brings hope to ROTMG to show this game's full potential. Very excited to see what happens.
9559	1	a	Wont let me open version error help (recommanded DO NOT play daily or you will be to addictive listen to me)

9563	1	a	Wont let me open version error help (recommanded DO NOT play daily or you will be to addictive listen to me)
9565	1	a	very fun game, but it can be rage-inducing when your character dies.
9567	1	a	So it goes like this:  Once upon a time, there was a contest for something or other, and so some people started making a game for said contest. They won, of course, and so emerged from the depths of a volcano in some land somewhere...  Realm of the...  ...MAD GOD.  A good game, yes, indeed. No pay to win, no lag... When one day, a terrible thing happened to the realm! It was purchased by none other than...  JACK M. CRAZYFISH! er i mean  KABAM!  No you imbiscle, not like the comic book guy getting punched, the game company. Stupid idiot.  Lag, pay to win, and much, much, worse. A slight delay in spells, just enough to mess up the timing. Harder enemies, more (hard) events, more ways to die.  Soon it became filled with trade bots, TRADE BOTS EVERYWHERE! (gasp)  But what made it pay to win? Well, I lied. It's not pay to WIN. It's pay to save you MULTIPLE HOURS. I have obtained items such as T5 Cloak of Endless Twilight (one of the best cloaks currently in-game) The T10 Staff of some-fancy-word-I-can't-remember, and the T11 Robe of the ditto-from-the-staff-before.  Anyone complaining that this game is P2W is wrong, wrong, and WRONG. It's very fun if you have a couple friends to go adventuring with, but I do not recommend for kids under age thre- I mean, people that have no friends.  6/10
9569	1	a	i played it for a while and i died and then i cried but i saw others having fun so its good
9571	1	a	-sigh-  such anger and sadness.
9573	1	a	Idk what to do in this game other than killing creatures.  11/10
9575	1	a	holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed me over and over i hate this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game lost 2 8/8  who cares imma just grind it again  gud geme
9577	1	a	Hahaha. I'm surprised to see this on Steam, considering it was originally a little in-browser thing. It's an amusing little waste of time, probably won't hold your attention for too long, but... it's fun for what it is, so go ahead and check it out if you've got a few hours to kill.
9579	1	a	Recently I got my first white bag, with a Lab Coat inside it, conviently I could use it as I was wizard, I warped out, went into godlands and 5 seconds later I died. I wanted to stab someone so badly... I would totally reccomend this game to anyone though as it is extremely fun. It just needs to have less ingame transactions, it ruins the fun.
9581	1	a	DIS IS A GAME WHERE A MONSTER ATTACKED AND EVERYONE DIED
9583	1	a	beware of bunnies in the mad action mega non-platformer top down shoot em up rpg with levels and stuff! as you quest in a bunch of really big cave things with planets in them you gotta try to beat the mad god eventually. try to level up fast because youll randomly get sent to fight him sometimes  or if you want you can just bail and play tag ]  also join guilds and stuff  and battle in an arena i havent seen yet  its really neat     also you can get drunk its funny 
9585	1	a	Work of art-10/10  This is almost better then Dota 2. Pretty tough choice to make. In Dota 2 (check my review for Dota 2) I stare at black screens all day and in ROTMG I go pew pew.   I love the fact that these kids pay tons of money for gear they will lose in the next day.
9587	1	a	If you can get passed the micro-transactions that allow plays to become maxed immediately, then there is tons of content and gameplay time you can get out of this. It is not pay to play, every item you see in those shops are obtainable from playing normally and it's really fun once you start to get the hang of the game. Pros- Can be played in a massive group or solo. Several weapons/armours/abilities/rings to farm for per class. Large community for help. A steady learning curve, you will get better. A pretty fair game when it comes to the permanent deaths, you shouldn't have many unfair deaths that make you ragequit. Cons- Spam bots Have to pay to unlock more character slots Hasn't been many major updates for a very long time.  This game just isn't for everyone, but it's free and definitely worth trying out. I'm not that into games with 3rd person view but I have hundreds of hours of this game on the ROTMG website.
9589	1	a	These graphics are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing, next-gen holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. If I could wear the Oculus Shift with this I would whip out my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stick it in the computer usb port, y'know it fits, and then I would ejaculate all over my keyboard and then take off the armor of my Paladin and wank harder like holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ man. These graphics are intense. They get me so erect.
9591	1	a	Don't be fooled by 68 hours, My main account most likley has several hundred hours of gameplay. This game offers so much, but it's rather difficult to get into, while being incredibly easy to get in to. Starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one, at first glance it's a fun game, but nothing you'd spent much time on. Now If you look past that, there is actually so much. The leveling system isn't what determines a character. Maxed stats are. In game 'potions' are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy, along with gear and other items. These potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completeing certain dungeons. To problem is, getting this far takes practice, detrmination and grit. Death is inevitable, dont let it set you back. Learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful. Even the most powerful characters who have all 8 stats maxed are prone to quick deaths, the game in unforgiving, and requires skill, but offers much in return for those who deliver.
6766	0	a	Bloody overrated piece of crap
6767	0	a	This game relies on heavily overpriced microtransactions, and is completely pay to win. I have not spent any money on it... SO WHY IS IT SO ADDICTIVE???
9593	1	a	I love this game. While the game is a bit dull by itself, add in one friend and the thing will skyrocket. I've never regretted a second I played!
9595	1	a	Realm Of The Mad God(RotMG) is one of my favourite games is steam right now. You willl be facinated of what classes to unlock and what items the game Has in store For You At First, you will feel Bored but when you get to lvl 20 your life will be change forever. This game is a retro 8-bit style game.It has Alot of classess to be unlocked and lots of items. It is a perma death game too. so if u die then u must create a new character again.But this is the type of challenge that we want in the community and it will be rewarding after you kill Dungeon Bosses to get Soulbound bags.What are Soulbound Bags? Well they are loot that are in a specific bag color. The colors ranges from Purple , Cyan and white. White Bags Are the hardest to get but has good stuff inside and you have pets too who has alot of abilities which can aid you in battle. the places you should avoid unless you have better equips and at least lvl 20 which are Godlands(glands).You can die Pretty much instantly by some gods like Medusa(Snake Head Lady),Leviatan(Blue Creature) and Djinns(blue creature that shoots snowballs) and more.Whenever you feel your screen shaking, its time to meet Oryx.Oh and expect death whenever that happens because he is the hardest boss in the game and alot of players die by him.so i recommend you to nexus or die a brave person.Whenever you die, dont be sad just think about what your next character is gonna be and start over again.Remember Guys, EXPECT DEATH!!  -StxofDark(RotMG Username0
9597	1	a	its a good game
9599	1	a	The community sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥, but the new dev team seems promising. This game WILL suck in your time. Be warned! :D
9601	1	a	This game is just flipping hilarious! It takes RPGs to never before seen level of craziness! From sumo warriors to hobbits this addictive game has it all! Really recommend it!
9603	1	a	Great game to try for fun. I love the 'you only live once' style games, and the fact that this is an MMO makes it all the more epic! Can you beat the boss and laugh as the noobs around you die? Or will you join their pile of corpses? Haha fear not, you can save most valuable items in your 'vault' and those items carry over from character to character. Once you become hardcore though, you will invest heavily into the stat lines of your main characters maxing out their stats so they are tougher, and fight a lot better.
9605	1	a	i love Realm of the Mad God
9607	1	a	I see a lot of reviews not recommending this game because they say it's 'pay to win'. I don't agree with this at all. I've played this game quite a bit, not only through steam but through the website itself as well. I think the reason people believe it's pay to win is because of the starting area, where the new developer put the option, right where you spawn, to purchase very high tiered gear with coins, which can only be bought with real money. I don't think this is the best idea, because it imbalances the economy some and also encourages people who don't know what their doing to spend money on this equipment, only to lose it soon after by dying in this PERMADEATH game. That said though, this DOES NOT make the game pay to win. All of this equipment is obtainable through looting or trading with other players for other loot. There aren't many things that can ONLY be bought with real money, and these things are mostly clothing dyes, alt skins, food items to grow your pet faster then normal, and things like character slots or inventory space. Not having these things won't really detract from your experience playing this game, and it is definitely not pay to win. Maybe pay to get ahead slightly faster, but not pay to win.   With that out of the way, I can definitely recommend this game. Like I said above, I've put many hours into this game because, put simply, it is a lot of fun. It's a fast paced bullet-hell permadeath shooter mmo that also just happens to be free, and there's no risk in trying it out.
9609	1	a	great game, for the adventurous. can loose hours to this game!
9611	1	a	Awesome game. Highly recommend
9613	1	a	Brilliant....Utterly Brilliant
9615	1	a	Realm of the mad god is a pixelated version of DIablo
9617	1	a	I can't even describe how annoying this game is. You spend 20 minutes grinding to the point where it's actually kind of fun and challenging, and then sometimes within 5 minutes of that, you die, lose everything, completely reset, and you're back to having to grind with a new character. What's worse is the death is almost always do to a massive lag spike caused by the server dumping everyone into a final boss battle before resetting the map. This game takes almost zero skill, just luck and endless patience.
9619	1	a	Fun game with some bugs. It is a good transition to Hardcore (permadeath) games, as it is a bit more casual than fx Path of Exile.  I would describe it as a For the luls hardcore game. If you get hooked it can get expensive, as you don't get much on your account to start with.
9621	1	a	Nice indie-game so far.
6769	0	a	Playing for free is basicly a demo.  Gameplay is hard at times but fair. Lag screws you over at times.  BTW I used to play at school using the ROTMG web site rather than using steam.
9623	1	a	this is a really good game with coop with your friends and slaying anything and everything together is really cool
9625	1	a	probably the most weird nonsenseable game ever but its a fun 8-bit bullet fest...swords shoot bullets everything does. but death pisses me off.i loose all my good loot.
6770	0	a	bad song bad everything
9627	1	a	Well you see this game made me rethink my life and i am now a succesylfl bussymen
9629	1	a	Best game ever at times then the Worst game at others but was defently more fun before the KABAM nation attacked. Turining the game a liltle Pay-to-win 
6771	0	a	Maybe playing it for half and hour, then it gets pretty repetitive and boring. :/ If you die you lose all your progress, I don't understand how it can have such a high metascore
9631	1	a	it wont start it always just goes strait to a black screen. how do i fix that? 
9633	1	a	The game is great fun and an amazing game to play with friends. Tons of room for progression and customization isn't half bad either (Through the use of dyes/skins).  One downside is the presence of micro-transactions. While they are there, they are not obtrusive and pay to win is kept mostly to a minimum, almost every item you can buy with gold can be gotten in-game for free. Some exceptions include backpacks, xp potions, pet food, and loot tier potions.
9635	1	a	pretty boring 8bit style MMO Bullet Hell RPG. Suffered a bit of a breach where a hacker got in.  Game gets pretty boring after dying the eighth time and having to level up.
9637	1	a	WHY GOD IS MAD? I DON'T CARE  GAME GOOD.
9639	1	a	You think stepping on a Lego is painful; try dying with a level 19 character.
9641	1	a	i like that you can get rare items adn i dislike nothing XD
9643	1	a	its free and its a good game!
9645	1	a	its fun but youll break your computer if you play it. not because of the processing power needed but because of the rage
6772	0	a	what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9647	1	a	Don't listen to other people. It's definetely not P2W. I played this game a ton on the website and i maxed a lot of characters without even paying Kabam a single penny. 10/10.
9649	1	a	This game is not a very forgiving game in any form. Those that take the high risks get the High rewards, but in a perma-death game, the rewards are easily gone with a simple mistake. After 60 hours of playing thi\s game, you hope to have a clan that will back you up, you get some of the best gear, and don't die by a Night Elf. Micro Transactions will get you the best gear in the game, but that takes more of the fun out of it. If you spend your coin (real life cash) then unly by from special deals, and make it storage or extra character slots, things you can keep after death.
9651	1	a	Realm of the Mad god, The hub world for the latest game! 'Who can ninja the best stuff!' It's addicting as hell!!!
9653	1	a	Very fun game played for nearly 2 years now and to all those haters complaining about p2w U dont have 2 scrubs ._.
9655	1	a	Despite many reviews saying Kabam ruined the game, I have to say the game is quite fun. Paying in this game won't make you automatically win, you still have to have enough skill to survive, BUT paying for things such as extra character slots or extra storage space is super helpful. After playing this game, you feel inclined to purchase things, instead of forced to. You can easily have a fun experience without spending any money.
9657	1	a	Airquotes that are so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing huge around ''free'' that you can see them from space
6773	0	a	stuck on maintenance screen, buttons do nothing
6774	0	a	It wont let me in the game at all with my steam account nor will it allow me to sign in with another account, I fairly enjoyed this game until it decided to give me the shaft so hard that my face looked like a war head wrapper. So No for me to put it shortly.
9659	1	a	its a fun game i suck at it though and its hard to level up
9661	1	a	Have Fun with friends for a couple of hours. Nothing more.  Pretty heavy pay2play, I mean a lot of features are only available by spending money on this game. There, I prefer to buy a game once and play.
9663	1	a	Gives that true RPG feeling, with 'unbeatable' bosses that take tons of people and teamwork to take down.  Love it.
9665	1	a	Best game ever at times then the Worst game at others but was defently more fun before the KABAM nation attacked. Turining the game a liltle Pay-to-win 
9667	1	a	dont die and you will have a fun time.
9669	1	a	preety guud
9671	1	a	This game is a fun to play game with tones of customization . Many people may quit the game from frustration after dieing. That is half the fun though is building your way back up to the top. I love this game and I am certin you will too.
9673	1	a	Great game
9675	1	a	takes a large amount of planing and skill to play this because it is hard and the gang lands are the hardest boss in the game to create a badess character
9677	1	a	It's a mighty fine game gents. It's fast paced and fun, the downside is that's perma-death but if you're willing to give it a go and get in to it I'm sure you'll like it
9679	1	a	I love this game its really fun and if you dont like it you never paid money for it so thats helpful i know ive bought games i dont like
9681	1	a	Its hard, but awesome! Is harsome!
9683	1	a	Rip life
9685	1	a	This game is a highly addictive, fast paced MMORPG with tons of items, features and capabilities. With an intense difficulty level and never-ending combat(Of course you can go take a break, but in order to progress, you HAVE to fight), this game is easily one of the best MMORPGs on the Steam Marketplace. You can play with dozens of friends and team up to kill major bosses. And to top it all off, it's free! If you're into fast-paced MMORPGs where you can team up with friends and go through countless battles, this is the game for you.
9687	1	a	Good game to play to kill time.
9689	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ kabam used to be good but hey p2w is fine too
9691	1	a	Fun game to play once u get the hang of it. The only problem people might have is the fact that its a perma death game.
9693	1	a	it's very fun to go out and adventure with people and raid dungeons and get better armor and weapons and improve your stats over a period of time  
9695	1	a	This game isn't pay to win, it just takes a little longer to get better if you dont spend money on the game.
9697	1	a	Very nice little game with lots of classes to choose from like the Wizzard, Huntress, Ranger and more, Also really addicting!
9699	1	a	i love this game
9701	1	a	Very fun, but I wouldn't recommend this game if you have a short temper.
9703	1	a	-=WARNING THIS GAME IS FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN HANDLE DYING=- This game is extremely fun, but you will die ALOT. This game is permadeath..sorta. You see when you die you lose all the items you had equiped but there is a vault witch keeps your stuff between characters in the chest. Witch means you always dont want to equip your best gear because your afraid of dying.i have only just finished getting to lv20 for the 3rd time and after that dont go running to gods rightaway you want to stay back do enough damage to get loot. Players in RotMG have a thing called 8/8 it means 8 out of 8 of thier sts are maxed. To max a stst you have you get sts potions witch drop from gods yet since your not 8/8 its very difficult to do. If your new to this game dont go asking people for stuff or YOU WILL BE YELLED AT. Overall this is a very good game but very difficult to 'beat'. I give this game a 8/10 for its very fun gamplay and the community that comes with it.
9705	1	a	If your looking for a great rpg mmo rogue like feature game THEN this ones for you, having over 200 hours on record the game still doesnt get old, having the feature to play a different character everytime is ideal for people who get bored easily, I recommended this game to any Steam player. 10/10
9707	1	a	yes its so great i luv it
9709	1	a	Great fun! played for months while in school. Many have lived and died. Many more have yet to be made.
9711	1	a	Very good, interesting and HARDCORE game!
9713	1	a	I played this game a little bit. It's ok.
9715	1	a	Lacks much variability and thus may become boring and repetitive at times. Can be unfair and ridiculously challenging at times, even with decent equipment. Tutorial only teaches you only basic controls and then throws you out into the open world with little knowledge of what to do. The amount of in-game purchases they try to force down your throat is quite frankly astonishing. These flaws aside, it's an addicting; fun little game.
9717	1	a	fun my expirnce was ruined by my bad keybord but it's fun 
9719	1	a	Recently, Kabaam has passed the rights to Deca games and we will be getting consistent updates because of this. So it's a great time for old players to come back to the game and new players to try out the game due to the events and freebies we are currently getting. Although there are some issues and suggestions that I want to point out such as:  -Hackers, multiboxers and bots although theres not alot of them anymore compared to before but I've encountered some that ruinied runs and event bosses for some people including me. -Higher resolution or proper full screen since maximizing the game stetches out the window or game making it tedious. -Make deaths less devastating and give the fame currency more application other than pets and guilds -Workshop items maybe such as character skins encouraging people to make a great looking skin and vote which is the best looking skin and release a set of character skins every month. -Make some old skins accessible or buyable other than the lucky box for newer players or players who missed them. -More fun and balanced classes and items or tier -More fun dungeons and events -Less devastating deaths or more rewarding deaths (form of progression).  Overall the game is a fun RPG with permanent death death especially when you meet some people that would help or join you and will make you want to play more and get more white bags or get a white bag. 
9721	1	a	Used to play this game all the time- then Kabam came in. Rarely touched the game at all after that. DECA games has now stepped in and great improvements have been made. The game seems to be going in a great direction, and I can't wait to see what new content DECA will be adding.   The game is a bullet-hell MMO, with perma death. This makes the game very intense (if you are a new player, that is. Kabam added in pets and once you have played for a year or 2, just by simply having a good pet nearly everything in the game is no longer a challenge) and fun to play with friends.
9723	1	a	Awesome and addicting game. Really requires you to concentrate and improve yourself. It might feel like tough at first, but it will get easier. Learning curve can be cruel for newcomers, but there are plenty of people to give tips and helpful community!
9725	1	a	So far Deca Games has been nothing but accommodating and interesting. Actually making some progress into the disaster that was Kabam. And even trying to atone for them with some free gifts (which were not overpowered or lacking, btw). I have a few things to suggest, however.   1. Fix or remove the Alchemist please. It saddens me that I can't use my tarot cards to get Alchemist rolls with the Tinkerer anymore.  2. Find a way to efficiently deal with multiboxers. Either with account numbers viewable from right clicking a players name, or by just hiring some community mods.  3. The steam version of Realm doesn't scale pop-up boxes appropriately. When you are in fullscreen (And only fullscreen as far as I can tell) and you talk to the Tinkerer or go into the options menu while in the nexus it generates improperly, can be offscreen, and is sometimes impossible to close/makes certain buttons unclickable. This is quite annoying and hopefully fixable. The most annoying instance in which this occurs is right when you enter the nexus after starting the game. You get an ad for Ambrosia almost every time. If you are in full screen when that happens the pop-up 'X' button generates offscreen and makes it so that you have to restart the game. It's a small detail, but after many hours me and my friends agree it has to be one of the most annoying parts of the game, especially when you are trying to rush to that Candyland portal after the game crashes. 4. Fix game/server crashes to some extent. I'm no computer scientist, but try to find any type of fix please. Maybe set up a bug report system that feeds system information, the way microsoft does? Improve the server load capacity? I don't know, but anything would help. I hate, and I'm sure many others do as well, getting kicked in the middle of an Oryx run.  This is all I've got for now, but I'm going to do some inquiry into what my friends dislike about the game and paste it here as well.   Thanks for all you've done so far Deca Games. Keep up the good work.  I believe in you. : )
9727	1	a	i do like the game but please fix the oryx castle lag cause A LOT of people die from the lag like my 4/8 archer ppe in a solo candy land when against the gigacorn. (this may be annoying to player who are reading this comment...) So. when we leave a dungeon we should be able to go into the castle,chamber or wine cellar without having players wait about 3 hours for the realm to close again, it would be fair to most players. My idea is they would go into chamber if everyones in chamber, castle if everyone is in castle,or wine cellar,if everyone is in the cellar, it would be cool cause us rotmg players know how annoying it is to do all the lvl 11 quests (the only good thing abt it is the qot) and we only get thechance to go in the castle... WTF IS THAT plz fix kabams errors and we will have rotmg revieved
9729	1	a	Oh â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I lost track of time.
9731	1	a	10/10 Would ruin life again.
9733	1	a	DON'T READ THIS. YOU WILL BE KISSED ON THE NEAREST POSSIBLE FRIDAY BY THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.TOMORROW WILL BE THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. NOW YOU'VE STARTED READING THIS. DON'T STOP. THIS IS SO FREAKY.1. say your name ten times.2. say your mom's name five times.3. say your crushes three times.4. paste this to four other games.If you do this, your crush will kiss you on the nearest Friday.But if you read this and do not paste this, then you will have very bad luck.SEND THIS TO 4 GAMES IN 143 MINUTES. WHEN YOU'RE DONE PRESS F6 AND YOUR CRUSH'S NAME WILL APPEAR IN BIG LETTERS ON THE SCREEN. THIS IS SO FREAKY BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY WORKS LOL
9735	1	a	Amazing game, i really like the 8-bit graphics and gameplay. In my opinion this game is pretty hard. I reccomend this game A LOT
9737	1	a	Its art style is unique,and the gameplay is entertaining yet challenging enough. Definitly a great game to grab!
9739	1	a	Good game. Think of it as a Demo.... You Won't be able to master it without putting money in.... Expect death, and realize it's part of the game
9741	1	a	RotMG is a very unique MMO. It manages to combine teamwork, bullet hell, and dungeon crawling in one neat package. Hope right in and watch as you quickly level up and gain power, then suddenly be killed and lose it all, then hop in again and get it all back! Server strain is a big issue, but as long as they aren't full you should be able to manage. Maxing out your class of choice is quite a challenge, and should keep you entertained for quite a while. The aforemented Mad God is also quite satisfying when you do get to attack it. The hilarity of watching a whole server scramble through his punishing dungeon is very memorable indeed.  If I had to say what this games biggest flaw is, it would be the turn towards pay-2-win it has taken. This unfortuantely was not always a problem; realm gold (the game's premium currency) used to just be good for buying cosmetic dyes and pets, or extra storage space. Now, with all sorts of high-tier gear being offered for it, the game feels more hollow and less rewarding. The adventure is still there, but it seems redundant when you can bypass it with the wave of a credit card. This is what personally keeps me from getting back into the game (along with technical difficulties with connecting to my Kongregate account), but if you're fine with it, don't let me stop you! It's still a wonderful game, and i'd recommend at least giving it a shot. It's free, after all; what have you got to lose?
9743	1	a	good for wasting an hour once in a while.
9745	1	a	Great Game. Really Liked It.
9747	1	a	Its ok
9749	1	a	Frantic, flashy and fun. This game tests your relfexes and skills as you make your way through the realm of the mad god. The aim: The aim of the game is to level up, accumulate loads of fame, and to defeat Oryx the mad god. Likes: I love this game because it's fun and a good challenge, it's also surprisingly fun to play with a friend. The guild system is well designed, and easy to use/run. Dislikes: While their are a few faults with the game there are _ main problems. Number 1: It's very flashy and in your face, especially in the Godlands, so if you've got epilepsy, I wouldn't advise going to the godlands if you want to get this game. Number 2: You have to pay to get anywhere in this game. Summary: Overall I'd reccomend this game, but only if you're willing to pay a little bit. There done.
9751	1	a	the best game ever
9753	1	a	I like a challenge, i find that in this game
9755	1	a	#Makethisgamegreatagain @Deca Games
9757	1	a	  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this Game and i love you Henry &lt;3!  I want to win the contest!
9759	1	a	The evil empire of Kabam is dead, now with Deca I can see a brighter future.
9761	1	a	helo is nice gaem with litel bit chalenche, is god but also bad, is nice i like i rate 4/5 bananas
9763	1	a	It's alright I suppose.
9765	1	a	Best dank meme simulator with bullets since TF2.  12/11 
9767	1	a	Honestly love this game. played it for hundreds of hours and cant get enough of it. expecially now that DECA took over the old holders of the game. This game has a great community and lots of friendly people to play and have fun with
9769	1	a	Thanks Deca games.Make this game great again!
9771	1	a	Ye fam hit it up!
9773	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, and in my opinion, completely worth your time. If you are a fan of bullet hells, and perma-death I think you'll be a fan. It isn't as good as it used to be (with the addition of a large number of pay-to-win aspects) it is still at its core, a fun game. I recommend trying it out and sticking around to see what DECA (the new owners) will do to improve it. Also, play on your browser or with flash projector, Steam is far to laggy.
9775	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is lit fam
9777	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, it may seem very simplistic at first, but once you begin playing its a very rage indusing but rewarding expierience. Would reccomend to any gamer.
9779	1	a	So, first of all, I would like to acknowledge the quality of gameplay this outstanding game has brought upon me. Because of this game, it has made me want to kill myself on a daily basis, has given me the thought of joining the KKK and has made me want to vote for Donald Trump. The feelings this game has given me has opened my eyes about how cruel this world is and how better off I am becoming a stripper. Games like this have given me such unforgettable memories that I will unfortunately cherish forever. Moments that I still remember after starting this game one year ago. Where I died as an archer to a Scorpion King with its very OP family of bratty scorpion children, and the first time I've gotten a white bag, in which I lost right away after some monsters came in from the other room of an Undead Lair dungeon. After all of these overwhelming events, I reccomend this game to any toxic kids from XBox Live so they can feel just how we feel when they tell us to drink bleach. 10/10 Game.
9781	1	a	I absolutely adore this game. It's one of the only games you play for a week and die then stop playing for three months.
9783	1	a	Pretty dope game
9785	1	a	I think that its pretty cool
9787	1	a	good game but it will take a cople of trys to get to max lvl for every charnter
9789	1	a	As a player that has played on and off for more than 4 years, I can safely tell you that RotMG's best days are already gone. Kabam, the owner of the game, neglected the game for years. The player base was shrinking, and many duping/hacking exploits where being used everywhere. This could all make one turn away from this game. However, times are changing. A new company called Deca Games has bought RotMG and is striving to breath new life into it. They have already established a connection with the community and have worked long hours to patch the exploits that made the game unplayable for the honest man.Because of the fact that RotMG seems to be going in a very positive direction, I would highly recommend this game.
9791	1	a	DECA GAMES.... I have been a realm player for a long time and have been enjoying the game for years... kabam made me sad and i can't wait to see you make realm great again ;) Love you and hope you succeed
9793	1	a	good game but many rwt bots.  IGN: KarlPPE
9795	1	a	The kind of game that makes you cry when you die
9797	1	a	The god is REALLYmad, and he IS in a realm. 20/10
9799	1	a	Here's my review on this game:  Pros: Is free, Is a permadeath MMO where you can find loot, You can make a guild, You can play with your friends easily with the 'Lock' thingy  Cons: If you don't pay it's awfully slow to lvl up Is basicly Pay to win 'Beginners Package' pops up everytime you log in and sometimes it glitches to the edge of the screen where you can't close it, Once you die you're dead, Gold is hard to get in this game, You only start off with 1 charachter slot  Ornx summons EVERYONE, including lvl 1's to his castle which is really hard.  Overall I find this game very addictive so it's a 6.5/10
9801	1	a	A simple rougelike MMO, which even now I wonder how such an awesome idea didn't come to be sooner.  Unlike other MMO's your character does not respawn. This means that you must make a new character everytime you die. That may sound tedious, but there is no character customization outside of the class you choose so you can quickly start playing. This makes becoming a high level player a measure of a players ability to decide when to attack, when to retreat, and when to call your friends to gang up to get protected loot.  For those of you who play MMO's just for notoriety there are leaderboards for highest level in different time ranges.  EDIT: This game is very freemium now, but you can totally play the game just fine without paying for anything. Everything you buy is extra to what the game originally was.
9803	1	a	Looks Like A Good Game, Probably Will Get It Soon :D
9805	1	a	I don't know why peopleare giving this a thumbs down. This game is amazing!
9807	1	a	TEN OUTTA TEN HUNDRED OUT OF A HUNDRED BEST GAEM BEST GAEM
9809	1	a	I really enjoy it despite the permadeath.
9811	1	a	this game proves that graphics dont make a game. its a really fun rpg and its free to play download it
9813	1	a	evey one get this game its really adictve
9815	1	a	How do I buy with my steam money?
9817	1	a	I guess it's pretty addicting.
9819	1	a	This game is excellant for killing time,not a great game to play if you rage easily,but still a fun game that I easily reccomend for gamers that know what their doing! :D
9821	1	a	Really awesome game! I reccomend this game to everyone it is amazing! You can fight and hunt down monsters! The best part is that it is completely free! Yay!
9823	1	a	Mad, pestering, addicting and fun. You'll hate it has much as you'll love it.
9825	1	a	Can some 1 please help em i am facing some problems .. There is This (loading version error , Retrying) Well i Googled it i downloaded the new adobe with other Browser and Still Nothing Happened is there a problem atm ? or its just me? if its just me please please please Help me i really wanna check this game out &amp; thanks alot for your time =)
9827	1	a	i want more games like this, pre buy out.
9829	1	a	Wow i never get the good stuff... 10/10!!!
9831	1	a	Great game, especially when you get to a high level, but is a real â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ take when you die
9833	1	a	I love this game. But i have one flaw, or i just suck at the game. How do you get coins? Because i want to unlock the perist class but i dont have enough coins. Otherwise This game is awesome and you should give it a try. Its now one of my favorite mmo's
9835	1	a	Fun, but make sure you have good specs and internet or this'll lag like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9837	1	a	This game is really fun to use and play.  Small size for an amazing game aswell as it's easy to pickup and play!
9839	1	a	This game is just great ! It's lots of fun to hunt down gods or to run dungeons with your friends :D I'm playing Realm of the mad God for 2 years now ( I think ) and I did some breaks for 1 or 2 months from RotMG, but after all, I came back and enjoyed it again and again. In the beginning it's pretty hard to stay alive and survive for longer than an hour, but when you played for some time and learned how the game works and how to farm stat potion's, the real fun beginns. But already in the begining I enjoyed the game, even though I really died a lot :D
9841	1	a	An amazing free-to-play MMORPG that has had me playing for hours upon hours If you like MMORPGs, then this is one that worth your time
9843	1	a	Man, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.  -reinstalls-
9845	1	a	Never thought I'd actually like this game. It's really good with gameplay even if it is all pixelated.
9847	1	a	At least there are monsters everywhere. Better than nothing other than dying on the spawn point instantly.
9849	1	a	This Game is Awesome, get it or you will die by my hands
9851	1	a	the mini-mmo that will suck out your soul
6779	0	a	why is it perma death
9853	1	a	This game is str8 up baller yo
9855	1	a	I like this game and played it a lot on Google Chrome. I recently got it on steam and have had a huge reminder of how hard it is to really have fun without making micro transactions! Lots of grinding is needed to advance further in the game but the multiplayer is fun! Its free to play so don't expect anything amazing unless you're willing to pay. Perfect to pass time.   7.5/10
9857	1	a	This game is getting a lot of bad reviews because people see it as 'pay to win'.  I'm here to fix that.  In the game 'Realm of the Mad God' there are thousands of micro transactions you can do to get better gear that would take a legit player longer. The only difference is, when you get the items from actual bosses in the game you learn the value of them, and how to use them instead of starting off with 20$+ of gear and dieing at level 15.  At least they don't sell stat pots in the nexus for real money, that way someone who paid 100$ is still not better than a legit maxed character.   tl:dr You can not pay and get a more rewarding experince!
9859	1	a	This is a very simple game which involves lots of grinding, learning through death, and losing everything in your inventory when you die, so why is it such a good game? That feeling you get when you get the loot. When you see a white bag for your first time, or get a Blue bag from a hard boss, they are what keep everybody in this game. That indescribable feeling of overwhelming excitement and happiness has kept me into this game for a long time. It's a very relaxing game, very little competition, but tons of fun!
9861	1	a	i love this game
9863	1	a	really stupid, fun game
9865	1	a	Realm of mad god may have many microtransactions but there is no need to spend anymoney they give your 400g at the begining of the game to get you started so u can buy 1 item and gt the rest buying the items is not nessasary some arent even rare (and they cost like 5$) and you can trade items you dont need for items you want (pots are the best) so lvl up go kill god/dungeon bosses and get your loot
9867	1	a	Fun and Addictive good job creator
9869	1	a	Hard to master? no doubt about that, this game may look seriously old, but it's actually pretty new, it's just retro style, it's totally free to play and it's really easy to get hooked on it :D
9871	1	a	Great casual game for whenever you need to kill some time :)
9873	1	a	Hours and Hours of Fun. Its really hard and one life is all you get so becareful what you do or you will lose all your stuff. And its free to play so you can't go wrong there.
9875	1	a	 Cooleo
9877	1	a	I highly recomend this game if you like dying a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on, losing all your stuff and having to replace your key board from pressing the Nexus hotkey so much. This game is enjoyable for all types of ragers. Please get this game a try it out! Before you max a character, just kill a worthless character first so you can know how it feels.
9879	1	a	Used to play it online. Didn't know it was on steam. Haven't played it for too long. Still love it.
9881	1	a	A Free-To-Play Bullet-Hell Shooter where you and many other people attempt to bring down the mad god. This is insanely hard, and it is great with friends, though it is viable alone. Highly recommend if you want a game like this one!
9883	1	a	The game is amazing, raiding dungeons is fun with friends but you can do it by yourself if you are a high enough level, the perma death adds a bit extra to the thrill factor of the game, I haven't played it much but I am in love with the game. Me and my friend has been playing it together and I have only died twice, probably one of the best mmo's yet
9885	1	a	Real Good
9887	1	a	So much rage inducing fun! I have a love/hate relationship with this game.
9889	1	a	A fun game that can get really ennoying if you die but is still worth it
9891	1	a	Great game. Whether you're playing to kill time or competing for top ranks, this game is perfect. A little bit of lag, but EXTREMELY fun.
9893	1	a	Since the game was bought out by Kabam, it has become incresingly more about getting money rather than making the game more enjoyable. The game however is still VERY enjoyable IF you simply ignore the purchasable content, I would definitely recommend it.
9895	1	a	Probably one of the best games i play, If you play it take some time don't quit instantly get some items and into the game before you decide.
9897	1	a	Overall pretty good game. Get's frustrating sometimes.. But fun.
9899	1	a	Quite possibly a one-of-a-kind-game. That alone makes this one worth playing once (or if you're like me, for hours). I've never played anything quite like this title and I doubt you have either. It has simple MMORPG style character customization, fast and frantic arcade style shooting, and perma-death. That's right, this is an MMO with perma-death. And yes, you WILL die (many, many, many times. I suggest you get used to the idea). Death is a part of this game and should be expected. Gear is largely transient(but still important in it's own right), and not hugely important as gear is trumped by skill. What's this you ask? An MMORPG where skill trumps gear? Quite welcome if I do say so myself. The game also has a very elegant solution to make 85 strangers want to play with one another. This title is one of the few I've ever played that offers TRUE coop, that works, and works very well with each player rewarded equally. The cash system is also ACTUALLY completely optional.
9901	1	a	ITS SO FUNNNNNN try it (disney reference XD)
9903	1	a	is rlly good
9905	1	a	Annoying, yet fun at the same time. When you ragequit after a huge loss, you eventually come back after some time.
9907	1	a	Don't lie, This takes you back. A free to play 8 bit rpg multiplayer shooter with multiple preset classes that you can use to murder random spawning gods and stay alive. The mad god will challenge you until you and your elite gear are wiped of existance and you start again, yep... Perma death. You fantasy fans and old people and kids finding a good shooter that is apropriate enough to keep them entertain and exhilarated for hours on end. Realm of the Mad God is a great game.
9909	1	a	Not for the weak willed. Game takes a while to get into, but once you do you're hooked. I got over 1300 hours and am not stopping anytime soon, nor do i regret it. Not necessarily a time sink, but difficult at the start.
9911	1	a	10/10 computers smashed 
6780	0	a	This is a pay to win game.   The best free to play games are the ones that have micro transactions only for cosmetics and dlc's (expansions). any game that does not fall within this type is usually not the best games to play.
9913	1	a	More of an action game with progression than an MMO. It's a fun little game that can easily suck your time away, especially if you're a fan of shmups or games with light RPG elements.  Try it out if you want something new. Besides, it's only about 50 mb big.
9915	1	a	Realm of mad god may have many microtransactions but there is no need to spend anymoney they give your 400g at the begining of the game to get you started so u can buy 1 item and gt the rest buying the items is not nessasary some arent even rare (and they cost like 5$) and you can trade items you dont need for items you want (pots are the best) so lvl up go kill god/dungeon bosses and get your loot
9917	1	a	ITS JUST AWESOME
9919	1	a	Amazing strategy game that can make you rage if you are at level 20 and die with good stuff. :(
9921	1	a	It's one of the greatest games I've played lately - it's addicting and interesting... sure I might not be the best at it but it's worth the time to try.
9923	1	a	Very fast paced game. It does manage to glitch up at times but that is fine 8/10
9925	1	a	OH MY GOD, THE RAGE!!!
9927	1	a	Fun, but make sure you have good specs and internet or this'll lag like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9929	1	a	This game is really fun to use and play.  Small size for an amazing game aswell as it's easy to pickup and play!
9931	1	a	Dont play this game its horrible 
9933	1	a	It's really a fun and addictive games
9935	1	a	I recomend this game. For some reason when you first start out you go into a relam and then you like just want to keep playing. t means what kind of teir it is. If you find a tier 4,5,or 6 do not give it away. you can only find those in very rare places. If you are a noob at this game and someone tries to offer you something by doing a trade for actual money just thats problay not even worth it no matter what it is just ignore it otherwise you are a idiot. I highly recomend this game though.
9937	1	a	Very good game, but can be a little frustrating due to the system of losing your items upon death.
9939	1	a	Permadeath game warning! If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.  Realm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.  With all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. It is simple yet elegant in design. Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell. Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal. There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.  The combat is point-and-click. You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ. There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.  You start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time. Then the game really begins. The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point. The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability. The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events. There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.  Equipment can be found everywhere. From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength. Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment. Equipment, Skill and stats are the 3 most important things when playing this game.  Once certain requirements are met, Oryx(the antagonist in this game) will seal the Realm and summon all players to his castle in order to wipe you out once and for all. Will he succeed? That's up to you.  When you first play this game, you will have 7 days to buy into a very good deal. +2 character slots and +3 vault chests, as well as 2600 gold(+5 chests is recommended) and a penguin pet. It is recommended that you use a spare email address to make a test account directly on the website  realmofthemadgod.com  (not on steam), to see if you like the game. If you like it, either continue to play through the website or make a Steam account. Having multiple character slots and vault chests available really helps because of the permadeath nature of this game. You can stock up spare equipment and stat pots in the chests and you can play multiple classes when you have more character slots. They have sales on character slots and vault chests relatively often, and those are the only things you'd want to spend money on..everything else is a waste because it is either consumable or will die with your character(backpacks are worth getting even though they die with you). Don't bother with the Steam DLC pack, it's not worth it.  I play this game almost exclusively(through the website). It's a lot of fun and is a near-continuous adrenaline rush. I'll reiterate, this is a game of skill and is not for everyone. Be sure to try it before investing your time and money into it.
9941	1	a	One of my friends spent $100 on this game.
9943	1	a	Yes, this game is very addicting and i cant get off of it.
9945	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9947	1	a	This game is fun .. but at the same time, addicting. Enter with caution.
9949	1	a	Really interesting game. 8 bit Bullet hell style game that will just keep you entertained for hours. So many unlockable classes will have you going til you finally face off against Oryx.
9951	1	a	its similar with Byond games
9953	1	a	A GREAT game, just a horrible company bought it that can't control breaches, turned the game into a money maker, and sucked the life out of RotMG. The GAME I recommend, the company, on the other hand, should go under.
9955	1	a	hip
9957	1	a	Lots of fun...until you run out of classes to unlock
9959	1	a	This game Is a free to play, quick downloading (like im talking in 2 minutes haha) and its multiplayer.The best thing I enjoy about it is that its so simple and runs so smooth you dont want to stop playing, so yes I would get this game if you have not played it yet.
9961	1	a	I love this game. However, it definitely falls into the love it or hate it category. It is accurate to describe it as a bullet hell RPG. Some people can't get past the art style alone, but again that's something I love about it. There are 14 character classes, which gives quite a bit of variety. You can play the game absolutely free, but you can also support the game and go the easy way by doing micro transactions within the game itself for items or customization. Part of this game is dying, especially by being a little too greedy or picking a bad teleport to some random person on the map. However, the max character level is 20 and it is easy to get back up there from level 1 in an hour. There are different levels of items and each class has its own special ability item as well. There are also pets that you can find or buy to give you in game bonuses. I don't like all the changes they've made since I first started playing it, but I still love the game. It's a rare game that you can have a lot of fun with by yourself or with a group of friends or even with random strangers.
9963	1	a	this game may look bad but the gameplay is really fun  p.s dying in this game is a troll 
9965	1	a	This game is super fun if you want to just kill random things in the world! You fight bosses and their minions! This game is super fun!
9967	1	a	Eh, it's free and really small. Unless your internet is made of strings and cups, it's probably worth trying.
9969	1	a	love this game
9971	1	a	Its good fun but at times seems as if it is pay2win.
9973	1	a	Even though its difficulty is off-the-chain, its gameplay is soo addicting that it makes you go back and want more, and its really fast-pasted along with the character chooser which takes seconds to get into combat, on the other hand, you dont want to go in to some heated battles lv 5-10 or under, and ive been having some lagging issues like button delays. If it didnt have that problem it would be an excellent game, and not to mention its FREEEEEEEE!
9975	1	a	IT'S CRAZY
9977	1	a	Other then occasional lag ever now and again, there really isn't much wrong with this game. The concept is simple, but the game is fun no matter how long you want to play. You can play just for 5 minutes when you have some spare time, or you can play with friends for hours and not get bored. One of the highlights of the game for me is Oryx's castle. Once all of Oryx's minions are killed, he sends the whole server to his castle. The game also is completely free to play, and won't force you to spend hundreds on enjoying the game.
6782	0	a	This game is a p2w game or better know as pay to win and I say this because if you dont buy like a rank or anything like that you have to spend countless hours more then if you pay.
9979	1	a	It is endless!!! So much fun!!!
9981	1	a	I absoloutley love games like this one try it and please tell me if you know about anything else like it
9983	1	a	Its a great game to play with firends and solo! Its a perect pixel game for rpg/mmo lovers!
9985	1	a	its a fun game i suck at it though and its hard to level up
9987	1	a	This game is so fun, just try it!
9989	1	a	I used to be a lot more into this game before amulets of resurrection were removed. Also it makes me mad that they pretty much destroyed all my work. Hey! I worked hard for those ammies. So if ammies ever come back I will probably get back into this game as much as I was before but as of now it'll just be a game I will come back to every now and again or when a friend tells me to.
9991	1	a	Have Fun with friends for a couple of hours. Nothing more.  Pretty heavy pay2play, I mean a lot of features are only available by spending money on this game. There, I prefer to buy a game once and play.
9993	1	a	its good game 
9995	1	a	Sends me into an whirling emotional episode every time one of my characters I spent over 30 hours on dies that implodes my soul and ruins my mood.   10/10 - Buy it.
9997	1	a	i cant play this game cause im bad 
9999	1	a	Fellow supporters of my cause, the 'Take back Pakistan for Call Centers and Jobs Awareness Association for People Who Are Muslim' find this game to be very enjoyable. Like murdering infidels families and then having a nice meal of sheep intestine for dinner. Praise Allah, may the Mad God be with you.
